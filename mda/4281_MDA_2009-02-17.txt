Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and ingot prices; production and shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) Overview Our Business Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and demand. Aluminum and alumina represent more than three-fourths of Alcoa revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. Alcoa products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, and industrial applications. Alcoa is a global company operating in 35 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, North America and Europe generated 54% and 26%, respectively, of Alcoa sales. In addition, Alcoa has investments and activities in Australia, Brazil, China, Iceland, Guinea, and Russia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. Management Review of 2008 and Outlook for the Future The following items represent a summary of financial and nonfinancial information for 2008: Sales of $26,901, despite the absence of 10 months of revenue related to the Packaging and Consumer businesses; Income from continuing operations of $229, or $0.28 per diluted share, which includes $670 of restructuring and other charges; Cash from operations of $1,234, reduced by pension contributions of $523; Cash on hand of $762, almost double historical levels; Debt-to-capital ratio of 42.5%; Significant progress made in the refinery expansion and bauxite mine development in Brazil; Successful start-up of the first greenfield smelter in two decades; Secured long-term power contracts for almost half of the global smelting system; and Completed the divestiture of the Packaging and Consumer businesses. 40 Table of Contents In 2008, the Company was faced with numerous challenges, including significantly higher costs for raw materials, energy, and other input costs and the continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real. During the second half of 2008, global economic markets began an unprecedented decline, which resulted in a historic drop in the LME cash price per metric ton. In response to such extraordinary market conditions, management made the decision to reduce Alcoa aluminum and alumina production by 750 kmt and 1,500 kmt, respectively. Management also initiated the following actions to secure cash and safeguard Alcoa liquidity: halted all non-critical capital expenditures; suspended the existing share repurchase program; added a new 364-day revolving credit facility; initiated global headcount reductions; instituted a global salary and hiring freeze; and decided to sell the Electrical and Electronic Solutions, Global Foil, and Transportation Products Europe businesses and to close the lone remaining Auto Cast Wheels facility. Additionally, Alcoa agreed to exchange its stake in the Sapa AB joint venture for Orkla ASA stake in the Elkem Aluminium ANS joint venture. This transaction will provide Alcoa with increased smelting capacity by gaining full control of two smelters with competitive hydropower contracts while divesting itself of a business that management determined to exit in 2007. While global demand for aluminum is expected to continue to decline in 2009, the actions that were initiated near the end of 2008 will allow Alcoa to emerge even stronger when the global economy recovers. In 2009, management will work toward the following goals: Conserve cash and preserve liquidity; Complete the S o Luis alumina refinery expansion and Juruti bauxite mine development in Brazil; and Seek out and take advantage of unique opportunities that arise during the global economic downturn. Results of Operations Earnings Summary Alcoa income from continuing operations for 2008 was $229, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with $2,814, or $3.23 per share, in 2007. The decrease in income from continuing operations was mostly due to the following: the absence of the gain related to the sale of Alcoa investment in Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco); significantly higher charges for the 2008 restructuring program; continued increases in raw materials, energy, and other inputs; increased net unfavorable foreign currency movements; the absence of all of the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment for 10 months; and costs associated with a gas outage in Western Australia and a complete smelter curtailment in Rockdale, TX. These negative impacts were slightly offset by the absence of certain costs associated with the Rockdale, Tennessee, and Iceland smelters and the absence of transaction costs and interest charges related to a potential business combination, all of which occurred in 2007. Net loss for 2008 was $74, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2,564, or $2.95 per share, in 2007. In 2008, the net loss of $74 included a loss from discontinued operations of $303, all related to the Electrical and Electronic Solutions (EES) business. Alcoa income from continuing operations for 2007 was $2,814, or $3.23 per diluted share, compared with $2,226, or $2.54 per share, in 2006. The increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the following: higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum; strong demand in the downstream businesses serving the aerospace and packaging markets; a gain on the sale of the investment in Chalco; a favorable adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business, a decrease in the charge recorded for last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory reserves; a non-recurring foreign currency gain in Russia; and the absence of labor contract and strike preparation costs recognized in 2006. These positive impacts were mostly offset by the following items: significant increases in energy, raw materials, and other input costs; net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker U.S. dollar; asset 41 Table of Contents impairments and restructuring charges associated with the Packaging and Consumer businesses and the Automotive Castings business, as well as a discrete income tax charge related to the Packaging and Consumer businesses; smelter curtailment costs associated with the power outage in Tennessee and the shutdown of one of the potlines in Rockdale; startup costs at the Iceland smelter; costs associated with the national labor strike in Guinea, the repairs of the refinery in Jamaica, and the restart of one of Intalco smelter lines; transaction costs and interest charges associated with a potential business acquisition; stock-based compensation expense for reloaded options; and the absence of a favorable legal settlement that occurred in 2006 related to a former Reynolds distribution business. Net income for 2007 was $2,564, or $2.95 per diluted share, compared with $2,248, or $2.57 per share, in 2006. In 2007, net income of $2,564 included a loss from discontinued operations of $250, comprised of a $243 loss related to the EES business, an $11 loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the 2006 sale of the home exteriors business, and net operating income of $4 of other discontinued businesses. In June 2008, a major gas supplier to Alcoa Western Australia refining operations (part of Alcoa of Australia) suffered a pipeline rupture and fire, which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers. The disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in Alcoa production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations. As a result, shortly thereafter, Alcoa of Australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts. During the second half of 2008, the supplier partially restored the gas supply to Alcoa of Australia (full restoration is expected in the first half of 2009). In addition, insurance recoveries of $52 were received in the second half of 2008. Net of insurance benefits, Alcoa earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was $49 after-tax and minority interest ($102 before tax and minority interest) in 2008. The Alumina segment was impacted by $33 after-tax ($47 before tax) and the remaining impact of $29 after-tax ($55 before tax) was reflected in Corporate due to Alcoa captive insurance program. Alcoa of Australia is part of Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), which is 60% owned by Alcoa and 40% owned by Alumina Limited. Also in June 2008, Alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production (three of six operating potlines or 120 kmt) at its Rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with Rockdale onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that Alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues. In September 2008, Alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines, or 147 kmt, as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter, well-known issues regarding the cost and long-term reliability of the power supply, and overall market conditions. In 2008, the earnings impact of the idled potlines was $55 ($90 pretax). Alcoa is seeking damages and other relief from its power supplier through ongoing litigation. Additionally, in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges in 2008 of $31 ($48 pretax) mostly for the layoff of approximately 870 employees (see Restructuring and Other Charges below for additional information). Late in 2008, management made the decision to reduce Alcoa alumina and aluminum production in response to the significant economic downturn. As a result of this decision, including the already completed production curtailment at the Rockdale smelter, reductions of 750 kmt, or 18%, of annualized output of Alcoa global smelting system were implemented. Smelters located in the United States (Tennessee, Indiana, and Washington) and Canada will be partially or fully curtailed. Also, alumina production will be reduced accordingly by a total of 1,500 kmt across the global refining system, including a partial curtailment at the Point Comfort, TX refinery. The alumina and aluminum production curtailments will be fully implemented by the end of the first quarter of 2009. Sales Sales for 2008 were $26,901 compared with sales of $29,280 in 2007, a decline of $2,379, or 8%. The decrease was driven mainly by the absence of 10 months of sales ($2,781) from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment, the absence of sales from the soft alloy extrusion business ($1,115 in 2007), and volume declines for most downstream businesses, especially related to the automotive and commercial transportation markets in North America and Europe. These negative impacts were principally offset by significantly higher primary aluminum volumes, mostly as a result of sales related to the production of the Iceland smelter for a full year, and favorable foreign currency movements, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Australian dollar. 42 Table of Contents Sales for 2007 were $29,280 compared with sales of $28,950 in 2006, an increase of $330 or 1%. The increase was primarily due to higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum of 7% and 4%, respectively; an increase in primary aluminum volume; higher demand in the aerospace and packaging markets; and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger Euro. These positive contributions were mostly offset by the absence of seven months of sales associated with the soft alloy extrusion business. Cost of Goods Sold COGS as a percentage of sales was 82.4% in 2008 compared with 77.9% in 2007. The increase in the percentage was mainly the result of continued cost increases in raw materials, energy, and other inputs; unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker U.S. dollar; the production at the Iceland smelter that did not occur in 2007; and the impacts of the gas outage in Western Australia and the 2008 smelter curtailment at Rockdale. These items were primarily offset by the absence of the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment for 10 months (84.0%); the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business (97.1% in 2007); productivity improvements in most of the businesses within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment; and the absence of certain costs incurred in 2007 as a result of production curtailments associated with the Tennessee and Rockdale smelters and startup costs at the Iceland smelter, among others. COGS as a percentage of sales was 77.9% in 2007 compared with 75.8% in 2006. The percentage increase was negatively impacted by significant increases in energy, raw materials, and other input costs, as a result of global inflation, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar. Other items that contributed to the higher percentage include smelter curtailment costs associated with the power outage in Tennessee and the shutdown of one of the potlines in Rockdale; repair costs at the Jamaica refinery due to the damage caused by Hurricane Dean; startup costs at the Iceland smelter; costs associated with the national labor strike in Guinea; restart costs for one of Intalco smelter lines; and the absence of a 2006 favorable legal settlement related to a former Reynolds distribution business. All of these items were partially offset by the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business; the increase in sales; a decrease in the charge recorded for LIFO inventory reserves; and the absence of labor contract and strike preparation costs that occurred in 2006. Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses SG&A expenses were $1,167, or 4.3% of sales, in 2008 compared with $1,444, or 4.9% of sales, in 2007. Expenses decreased by $277 mostly due to the absence of 10 months of expenses ($180) from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment; the absence of transaction costs related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($46); and the absence of expenses from the soft alloy extrusion business ($33 in 2007). SG&A expenses were $1,444, or 4.9% of sales, in 2007 compared with $1,372, or 4.7% of sales, in 2006. Expenses increased by $72 primarily due to $46 in transaction costs (investment banking, legal, audit-related, and other third-party expenses) related to the offer for Alcan Inc., an increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of reload features of exercised stock options, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar. Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of seven months of expenses related to the soft alloy extrusion business. Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses were $246 in 2008 compared with $238 in 2007 and $201 in 2006. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 was driven mainly by expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the Flat-Rolled Products segment and the Primary Metals segment, partially offset by the absence of 10 months of expenditures ($16) from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the Flat-Rolled Products segment and the Primary Metals segment. Provision for Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization The provision for DD&A was $1,234 in 2008 compared with $1,244 in 2007. The decline of $10, or 1%, was principally the result of the absence of nine months of depreciation from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment ($89 in 2007) and the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of refining and smelting locations and various rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review of estimated useful lives completed during 2008 ($61). Offsetting these 43 Table of Contents reductions was a significant increase ($83) in depreciation expense related to the Iceland smelter and Norway anode facility being in service for a full year and unfavorable foreign currency movements as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. The provision for DD&A was $1,244 in 2007 compared with $1,252 in 2006. The decrease of $8, or 1%, was primarily due to the cessation of depreciation beginning in November 2006 related to the soft alloy extrusion business and beginning in October 2007 associated with the businesses in the Packaging and Consumer segment, all of which was the result of the classification of these businesses as held for sale. These decreases were mostly offset by an increase in depreciation related to placing growth projects into service, such as the Pinjarra, Australia refinery expansion and the Jamaica Early Works Program that were both placed in service during 2006, and the start-up of operations related to the Iceland smelter and the Mosj en anode facility during 2007. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 were comprised of the following: 2008 2007 2006 Asset impairments $ 670 $ 214 $ 442 Layoff costs 183 35 71 Other exit costs 109 47 35 Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs* (23 ) (28 ) (41 ) Restructuring and other charges $ 939 $ 268 $ 507 * Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs resulted from changes in facts and circumstances that led to changes in estimated costs. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2008 Restructuring Program Late in 2008, Alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio, partly due to the current economic downturn. Such actions include targeted reductions, curtailments, and plant closures and consolidations, which will reduce headcount by approximately 5,400 by the end of 2009, resulting in severance charges of $138 ($98 after-tax and minority interests), asset impairments of $156 ($88 after-tax and minority interests), and other exit costs of $58 ($57 after-tax). The significant components of these actions were as follows: As a result of recent market conditions, the Primary Metals segment will reduce production by 483 kmt and the Alumina segment will reduce production by a total of 1,500 kmt, all of which will be fully implemented by the end of the first quarter of 2009. These production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately 1,110 positions totaling $23 in severance costs. Asset impairments of $116 related to these two segments were also recognized, including the write off of $84 in engineering costs related to a 1,500 kmt planned expansion of Jamalco Clarendon, Jamaica refinery. The Flat-Rolled Products segment was restructured through the following actions: Restructuring and downsizing of the Mill Products businesses in Europe and North America, resulting in severance charges of $53 for the reduction of approximately 850 positions; Optimization of the Global Hard Alloy Extrusion operations, resulting in severance charges of $13 for a headcount reduction of approximately 240 and asset impairments of $3; Alignment of production with demand at operations in Russia, through the elimination of approximately 1,400 positions resulting in severance charges of $7; The shutdown of the Foil business in Bohai, resulting in severance charges of $6 for the reduction of approximately 400 positions, asset impairments of $24, and other exits costs of $54, primarily related to lease termination costs. 44 Table of Contents The Engineered Products and Solutions segment was restructured through the following actions: Exiting of the Auto Cast Wheel business, through the closure of the only remaining facility, which employs approximately 270, by June 2009 for severance costs of $2; Consolidation of operations in the Building and Construction Systems business to maximize operating efficiencies and align capacity with the decline in the commercial building and construction markets, resulting in severance charges of $6 for the elimination of approximately 500 positions; Alignment of production with demand across the Power and Propulsion business, resulting in the reduction of approximately 250 positions for a cost of $6; Other severance charges of $8 for the elimination of approximately 250 positions, asset impairments of $13, and other exit costs of $1. In order to reduce overhead serving various businesses, approximately 130 positions will be eliminated at Corporate, resulting in severance charges of $14 and other exit costs of $3. In addition to the above actions, Alcoa intends to sell its Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses in order to streamline its portfolio. As a result of this decision, the assets and related liabilities of the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses were classified as held for sale. Asset impairments of $129 ($100 after-tax) and $52 ($49 after-tax) were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses, respectively. Also, Alcoa and Orkla agreed to exchange their stakes in the Sapa AB and Elkem Aluminium ANS joint ventures. This portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of $333 ($223 after-tax) to reflect the estimated fair value of Alcoa investment in Sapa AB. Earlier in 2008, Alcoa recorded $48 ($31 after-tax) in charges, which consists of $44 ($29 after-tax) for the layoff of approximately 870 employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and $4 ($2 after-tax) for other exit costs, associated with the complete production curtailment of the Rockdale, TX smelter (267 kmt) due to ongoing power supply issues with Rockdale onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that Alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues. Also during 2008, Alcoa recorded a loss of $43 ($32 after-tax) on the sale of its Packaging and Consumer businesses. The remaining net charges in 2008 were comprised of $1 ($1 after-tax and minority interests) for severance related to a reduction in headcount of approximately 30, $4 for other exit costs ($6 after-tax), and $23 ($15 after-tax and minority interests) for reversals of previously recorded costs, slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 1,000 of the 6,300 employees were terminated. Cash payments of $7 were made against the 2008 program reserves in 2008. As a result of the implementation of this restructuring plan, Alcoa expects to eliminate approximately $330 (pretax) on an annual basis from its cost base once the program has been completed. 2007 Restructuring Program In 2007, Alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of $268 ($201 after-tax and minority interests), which were comprised of the following components: $257 ($174 after-tax) in asset impairments associated with a strategic review of certain businesses; a $62 ($23 after-tax) reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in 2006 related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business, which was contributed to a joint venture effective June 1, 2007 (see the 2006 Restructuring Program for additional information); and $73 ($50 after-tax and minority interests) in net charges comprised of severance charges of $35 ($26 after-tax and minority interests) related to the elimination of approximately 400 positions and asset impairments of $19 ($12 after-tax) of various other businesses and facilities, other exit costs of $47 ($31 after-tax and minority interests), primarily for accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of certain facilities in 2007 related to the 2006 Restructuring Program, and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs of $28 ($19 after-tax and minority interests) due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances. In April 2007, Alcoa announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for the potential disposition of the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment and the Automotive Castings business. In September 2007, management completed its review of strategic alternatives and determined that the best course of action was to sell the Packaging 45 Table of Contents and Consumer and Automotive Castings businesses. As a result of this decision, the assets and related liabilities of the Packaging and Consumer and Automotive Castings businesses were classified as held for sale. In the third quarter of 2007, Alcoa recorded impairment charges of $215 ($140 after-tax) related to the Packaging and Consumer businesses and $68 ($51 after-tax) for the Automotive Castings business to reflect the write-down of the carrying value of the assets of these businesses to their respective estimated fair values. In addition, Alcoa recorded a $464 discrete income tax charge related to goodwill associated with the planned sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses that would have been non-deductible for tax purposes under the transaction structure contemplated at the time. In November 2007, Alcoa completed the sale of the Automotive Castings business and recognized a loss of $4 ($2 after-tax) in Restructuring and other charges on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. In December 2007, Alcoa agreed to sell the Packaging and Consumer businesses for $2,700 in cash, and reduced the impairment charge by $26 ($17 after-tax) and the discrete income tax charge by $322 as a result of the structure of the agreed upon sale (this sale was completed in 2008). As of December 31, 2008, the terminations associated with the 2007 restructuring program were essentially complete. Cash payments of $20 and $13 were made against the 2007 program reserves in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 2006 Restructuring Program In November 2006, Alcoa executed a plan to re-position several of its downstream operations in order to further improve returns and profitability, and to enhance productivity and efficiencies through a targeted restructuring of operations, and the creation of a soft alloy extrusion joint venture. The restructuring program encompassed identifying assets to be disposed of, plant closings and consolidations, that led to the elimination of approximately 1,800 positions across the company global businesses. Restructuring charges of $507 ($347 after-tax and minority interests) were recorded in 2006 and were comprised of the following components: $71 of charges for employee termination and severance costs spread globally across the company; $442 related to asset impairments for structures, machinery, equipment, and goodwill, more than half of which relates to the soft alloy extrusion business; and $35 for other exit costs, consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation associated with assets for which the useful life has been changed due to plans to close certain facilities in the near term and environmental clean-up costs. Partially offsetting these charges was $41 of income related to the reversal of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs resulting from new facts and circumstances that arose subsequent to the original estimates. The significant components of the 2006 restructuring program were as follows: The hard and soft alloy extrusion businesses, included within the former Extruded and End Products segment, were restructured through the following actions: Alcoa signed a letter of intent with Orkla ASA SAPA Group (Sapa) to create a joint venture that would combine its soft alloy extrusion business with Sapa Profiles extruded aluminum business. Effective June 1, 2007, the joint venture was completed. The new venture is majority-owned by Orkla ASA and operated by Sapa. In 2006, Alcoa recorded an impairment charge of $301 to reduce the carrying value of the soft alloy extrusion business assets to their estimated fair value. In conjunction with the contribution of the soft alloy extrusion business to the joint venture, Alcoa recorded a $62 ($23 after-tax) reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in 2006. Consolidation of selected operations within the global hard alloy extrusion production operations serving the aerospace, automotive and industrial products markets, resulting in charges of $7 for severance costs associated with the elimination of approximately 325 positions, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Operations within the Flat-Rolled Products segment were affected by the following actions: Restructuring of the can sheet operations resulting in the elimination of approximately 320 positions, including the closure of the Swansea facility in the U.K. in the first quarter of 2007, resulting in charges of $33, comprised of $16 for severance costs and $17 for other exit costs, including accelerated depreciation. Conversion of the temporarily-idled San Antonio, TX rolling mill into a temporary research and development facility serving Alcoa global flat-rolled products business, resulting in a $53 asset impairment charge as these assets have no alternative future uses. 46 Table of Contents Charges for asset impairments of $47 related to a global flat-rolled product asset portfolio review and rationalization. Reduction within the Primary Metals and Alumina segments operations by approximately 330 positions to further strengthen the company position on the global cost curve. This action resulted in charges of $44, consisting of $24 for asset impairments, $14 for severance costs and $6 for other exit costs. Consolidation of selected operations within the Packaging and Consumer segment, resulting in the elimination of approximately 440 positions and charges of $19, consisting of $10 related to severance costs and $9 for other exit costs, consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation. Restructuring at various other locations accounted for the remaining charges of $35, more than half of which are for severance costs related to approximately 400 layoffs and the remainder for asset impairments and other exit costs. As of December 31, 2008, the terminations associated with the 2006 restructuring program were essentially complete. Cash payments of $9 and $37 were made against the 2006 program reserves in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the segment results. The pretax impact of allocating restructuring and other charges to the segment results would have been as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Alumina $ 89 $ - $ 4 Primary Metals 94 (2 ) 26 Flat-Rolled Products 289 56 139 Engineered Products and Solutions 88 67 - Packaging and Consumer 45 189 15 Segment total 605 310 184 Corporate 334 (42 ) 323 Total restructuring and other charges $ 939 $ 268 $ 507 Interest Expense Interest expense was $407 in 2008 compared with $401 in 2007, resulting in an increase of $6, or 1%. The increase was principally caused by a 22% higher average debt level, mostly due to the issuance of $1,500 in new senior notes in July 2008 and significantly higher commercial paper levels; and a decrease in capitalized interest ($32), primarily due to placing growth projects into service, such as the Iceland smelter and the Norway anode facility in 2007. These items were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($67) and a lower weighted-average effective interest rate, driven mainly by the decrease in LIBOR rates. Interest expense was $401 in 2007 compared with $384 in 2006, resulting in an increase of $17, or 4%. The increase was primarily due to the amortization of $30 in commitment fees paid and capitalized in June 2007 and an expense of $37 for additional commitment fees paid in July 2007, both of which were paid to secure an 18-month $30,000 senior unsecured credit facility associated with the offer for Alcan Inc., and a higher average debt level, partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized related to construction projects, including the Iceland smelter, the Juruti bauxite mine and S o Lu refinery expansion in Brazil, and the Mosj en anode facility. Other Income, net Other income, net was $59 in 2008 compared with $1,920 in 2007. The decrease of $1,861, or 97%, was mostly due to the absence of the $1,754 gain related to the sale of Alcoa investment in Chalco. Other items impacting this decline were losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets; unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; the absence of dividend income from Alcoa former stake in Chalco; and the absence of a non-recurring foreign currency gain in Russia; all of which was partially offset by mark-to-market gains on derivative contracts and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior Alcoa divestiture ($39). 47 Table of Contents Other income, net, was $1,920 in 2007 compared with $236 in 2006. The increase of $1,684 was primarily due to the sale of Alcoa investment in Chalco, which resulted in a gain of $1,754, net of transaction fees and other expenses, and a non-recurring foreign currency gain in Russia, slightly offset by a decrease in the amount of dividends received from Chalco between periods, and the absence of interest related to a Brazilian court settlement in 2006. Income Taxes Alcoa effective tax rate was 43.2% in 2008 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and Alcoa effective tax rate of 33.8% in 2007. The effective tax rate in 2008 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to the following income tax charges: $73 for the asset impairments included in the 2008 restructuring program; $28 due to a decrease in deferred tax assets of the Iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change; a net $19 associated with the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses, mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated, somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations. These charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a $20 discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the 2007 U.S. income tax return. Alcoa effective tax rate was 33.8% in 2007 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and Alcoa effective tax rate of 24.3% in 2006. The effective tax rate in 2007 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower taxes on foreign income, mostly offset by a discrete income tax charge of $142 related to goodwill that is non-deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses. Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2009 will be approximately 30%. However, changes in the current economic environment, currency fluctuations, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate significantly. Minority Interests Minority interests share of income from continuing operations was $221 in 2008 compared with $365 in 2007. The decline of $144 was mostly due to lower earnings at AWAC attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy, unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, and the impact of the gas outage in Western Australia. Minority interests share of income from continuing operations was $365 in 2007 compared with $436 in 2006. The $71 decrease was principally due to lower earnings at AWAC driven mainly by unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar and a significant increase in energy costs. (Loss) Income From Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was $303 in 2008 compared with a loss of $250 in 2007 and income of $22 in 2006. The loss of $303 in 2008 is all related to the EES business comprised of asset impairments of $162 to reflect the estimated fair value of the business and a net operating loss of $141, which includes restructuring charges of $39 for headcount reductions of approximately 6,200 and a charge of $16 for obsolete inventory. The loss of $250 in 2007 consisted of a $243 loss related to the EES business, including severance charges of $36 for headcount reductions of approximately 5,900 as part of a strategic business review to restructure EES and impairment charges of $93 for goodwill and $60 for various fixed assets as the forecasted future earnings and cash flows of the EES business no longer supported the carrying values of such assets; an $11 loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the 2006 sale of the home exteriors business; and net operating income of $4 of other discontinued businesses. The income of $22 in 2006 was comprised of a $110 gain related to the sale of the home exteriors business; a $65 operating loss related to the EES business, including severance charges of $30 for headcount reductions of approximately 4,800; net operating losses of $20 of other discontinued businesses; and a loss of $3 related to the 2005 sale of the imaging and graphics communications business. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Late in 2008, Alcoa reclassified its EES business to discontinued operations based on the decision to sell the business. The Consolidated Financial Statements for all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the EES business in discontinued operations. The EES business designs and manufactures electrical and electronic systems, wire harnesses and components for the ground transportation industry worldwide. In 2008, the EES business generated sales of $1,218 48 Table of Contents and had approximately 19,000 employees as of December 31, 2008. During 2006, Alcoa reclassified its home exteriors business to discontinued operations upon the signing of a definitive sale agreement with Ply Gem Industries, Inc. The sale of the home exteriors business was completed in October 2006. Also during 2006, Alcoa reclassified the Hawesville, KY automotive casting facility to discontinued operations upon closure of the facility. The results of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of EES, the home exteriors business, and the Hawesville automotive casting facility into discontinued operations. Segment Information In 2008, management approved a realignment of Alcoa reportable segments to better reflect the core businesses in which Alcoa operates and how it is managed. This realignment consisted of eliminating the Extruded and End Products segment and realigning its component businesses as follows: the building and construction systems business is reported in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment; the hard alloy extrusions business and the Russian extrusions business are reported in the Flat-Rolled Products segment; and the remaining segment components, consisting primarily of the equity investment/income of Alcoa interest in the Sapa AB joint venture, and the Latin American extrusions business, are reported in Corporate. Additionally, the Russian forgings business was moved from the Engineered Products and Solutions segment to the Flat-Rolled Products segment, where all Russian operations are now reported. Prior period amounts were reclassified to reflect the new segment structure. Also, the Engineered Solutions segment was renamed the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. Alcoa operations consist of five worldwide segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, Engineered Products and Solutions, and Packaging and Consumer (this segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 2008). Segment performance under Alcoa management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest income and expense; minority interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates used in the segments and the corporate effective tax rate, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gains/losses are excluded from segment ATOI. Segment assets exclude, among others, cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes, goodwill allocated to corporate, corporate fixed assets, LIFO reserves, and assets held for sale. ATOI for all segments totaled $2,199 in 2008, $3,162 in 2007, and $3,505 in 2006. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The following discussion provides shipments, sales, and ATOI data of each segment, and production data for the Alumina and Primary Metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Alumina 2008 2007 2006 Alumina production (kmt) 15,256 15,084 15,128 Third-party alumina shipments (kmt) 8,041 7,834 8,420 Third-party sales $ 2,924 $ 2,709 $ 2,785 Intersegment sales 2,803 2,448 2,144 Total sales $ 5,727 $ 5,157 $ 4,929 ATOI $ 727 $ 956 $ 1,050 This segment consists of Alcoa worldwide alumina system, including the mining of bauxite, which is then refined into alumina. Alumina is sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is processed into industrial chemical products. Slightly more than half of Alcoa alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally. 49 Table of Contents In 2008, alumina production increased by 172 kmt compared to 2007. Three of Alcoa nine refineries achieved production records in 2008 with the largest increase occurring at the Pinjarra (Australia) refinery due to the continued positive effects of the efficiency upgrade expansion completed in 2006. Late in 2008, Alcoa reduced production at its Point Comfort, TX refinery by 550 kmt per year due to negative market conditions; however, production for the year slightly exceeded the refinery 2007 production performance. In 2007, alumina production decreased by 44 kmt compared to 2006. Impacts from the national labor strike in Guinea and Hurricane Dean weighed on production with 8% and 14% decreases at Point Comfort, TX and Jamaica, respectively, offsetting a 4% increase at Pinjarra. Paranam (Suriname), S o Lu s, Wagerup (Australia), and Pinjarra set production records in 2007. Third-party sales for the Alumina segment rose 8% in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily related to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger Australian dollar and increases of 3% and 2% in third-party shipments and realized prices, respectively. Third-party sales for this segment decreased 3% in 2007 compared with 2006, principally due to a 7% reduction in third-party shipments more than offsetting an LME-driven increase in realized prices. Intersegment sales for the Alumina segment climbed 15% in 2008 compared with 2007 and 14% in 2007 compared with 2006, mainly as a result of a 6% and 7% increase in volumes, respectively, and higher realized prices. ATOI for the Alumina segment decreased 24% in 2008 compared with 2007, mostly due to significant cost increases for bauxite, caustic soda, fuel oil, and natural gas; unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; and the impact of the gas outage in Western Australia ($33 net of insurance benefits), all of which was partially offset by higher realized prices, productivity improvements, and a positive impact due to the curtailment of production at the Point Comfort refinery. ATOI for this segment declined 9% in 2007 compared with 2006, principally due to unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, significantly higher energy costs, and rising freight cost, all of which more than offset increases in realized prices. In 2009, Alcoa will continue to focus on completing the expansion of the S o Lu refinery (total additional alumina production of 2,100 kmt, Alcoa share is 1,134 kmt) and the development of the Juruti bauxite mine (total additional 2,600 kmt of bauxite, Alcoa share is 1,560 kmt) by the end of the first half. Also, in response to negative market conditions, Alcoa plans to reduce production by another 1,000 kmt per year by the end of the 2009 first quarter (1,500 kmt including the previously mentioned curtailment at Point Comfort). Additionally, fuel oil costs are expected to decrease while realized prices may decline significantly based on the LME current prices and short-term outlook. Primary Metals 2008 2007 2006 Aluminum production (kmt) 4,007 3,693 3,552 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 2,926 2,291 2,087 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum $ 2,714 $ 2,784 $ 2,665 Third-party sales $ 8,021 $ 6,576 $ 6,171 Intersegment sales 3,927 4,994 6,208 Total sales $ 11,948 $ 11,570 $ 12,379 ATOI $ 931 $ 1,445 $ 1,760 This segment consists of Alcoa worldwide smelter system. Primary Metals receives alumina, primarily from the Alumina segment, and produces primary aluminum used by Alcoa fabricating businesses, as well as sold to external customers, aluminum traders, and commodity markets. Results from the sale of aluminum powder, scrap, and excess power are also included in this segment, as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts. Primary aluminum produced by Alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. The sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90% of this segment third-party sales. In 2008, aluminum production increased by 314 kmt, mostly due to the Iceland smelter, as 2008 was its first full year of production; the Intalco, WA smelter as a result of the restart of additional pots early in the year; and the Tennessee smelter; all of which was slightly offset by a reduction at the Rockdale, TX smelter due to Alcoa decision to curtail 50 Table of Contents all production at this facility until competitive market conditions return (267 kmt per year). Late in 2008, Alcoa started partial production curtailments at various smelters, including Intalco and Baie Comeau, Quebec, which will result in an additional decline of 350 kmt per year. In 2007, aluminum production rose 141 kmt due to the Intalco smelter completed restart of one potline in the second quarter of 2007, the acquisition of the minority interests in the Intalco smelter in June 2006, and the Iceland smelter start-up in the second quarter of 2007. Third-party sales for the Primary Metals segment climbed 22% in 2008 compared with 2007, mostly due to higher volumes, primarily the result of the sales related to the production from the Iceland smelter, shipments made to the Packaging and Consumer businesses subsequent to their divestiture in 2008, and shipments made in the first half of 2008 to the Sapa AB joint venture (shipments to Alcoa soft alloy extrusion business were included in intersegment sales in the first half of 2007), somewhat offset by lower realized prices of 3%. Third-party sales for this segment increased 7% in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to an increase in realized prices of 4% and improved volumes, mainly due to shipments made in 2007 to the Sapa AB joint venture. Intersegment sales for the Primary Metals segment declined 21% in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly as a result of lower demand from Alcoa downstream businesses, the absence of 10 months of shipments to the Packaging and Consumer businesses that occurred in 2007, and the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in 2007. Intersegment sales decreased 20% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in 2006 and production curtailments associated with the Tennessee and Rockdale smelters that occurred in 2007. ATOI for the Primary Metals segment dropped 36% in 2008 compared with 2007 principally related to higher alumina, carbon, and energy costs; increased spending on repairs and maintenance, outside services, and labor; lower realized prices; the impact of the 2008 curtailment of all production at Rockdale ($55); and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar. These negative impacts were partially offset by the absence of costs incurred in 2007 associated with the following: the start-up of the Iceland smelter, the smelter production curtailment of one of the potlines in Rockdale, and the smelter curtailment associated with the power outage in Tennessee. ATOI for this segment declined 18% in 2007 compared with 2006 as unfavorable foreign currency movements related to a weaker U.S. dollar; costs associated with the Rockdale and Tennessee smelter curtailments; continued increases in raw material, freight, and energy costs; and Iceland smelter start-up costs were partially offset by higher realized prices. At December 31, 2008, Alcoa had 807 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,531 kmt. In 2008, idle capacity increased by 355 kmt as compared to 2007 due to the complete production curtailment at Rockdale (267 kmt) and partial curtailments of approximately 88 kmt related to other smelters, all of which are the result of current negative market conditions. At December 31, 2007, Alcoa had 452 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,573 kmt. In 2007, idle capacity decreased by 93 kmt as compared to 2006 due to the completed restart of one of Intalco smelter lines. Base capacity increased by 364 kmt in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the completion of the 344 kmt Iceland smelter. In 2009, Alcoa will curtail production by an additional 395 kmt (750 kmt including the previously mentioned curtailments), which includes all smelting at the Tennessee operations (215 kmt), by the end of the first quarter. Also, input costs are expected to decrease while Alcoa anticipates the realization of cost savings from recent procurement initiatives. Lastly, realized prices may decline significantly based on the LME current prices and short-term outlook. Flat-Rolled Products 2008 2007 2006 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 2,296 2,441 2,387 Third-party sales $ 9,563 $ 9,932 $ 8,995 Intersegment sales 249 283 253 Total sales $ 9,812 $ 10,215 $ 9,248 ATOI $ 27 $ 204 $ 244 51 Table of Contents This segment principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate, sheet, foil, and hard alloy extrusions. This segment includes rigid container sheet (RCS), which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans. Seasonal increases in RCS sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the transportation, building and construction, and distribution markets (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables), which is sold directly to customers and through distributors. Additionally, hard alloy extrusions products, which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors, serve the distribution, aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation markets. Approximately one-third of the third-party sales in this segment consist of RCS, while the remaining two-thirds of third-party sales are derived from sheet and plate, foil used in industrial markets, and hard alloy extrusions. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of RCS, sheet, and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Third-party sales for the Flat-Rolled Products segment decreased 4% in 2008 compared with 2007. The decline was principally due to lower volumes across all businesses, mainly the result of weak end markets in North America and Europe, partially offset by positive foreign currency movements, mostly due to a stronger Euro, and a favorable pricing and product mix. Third-party sales for this segment climbed 10% in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase was primarily due to passing through material price increases, favorable product mix associated with aerospace, higher volumes in the aerospace and packaging markets, and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger Euro. These increases were somewhat offset by the absence of sales associated with the shutdown of the Swansea, U.K. can sheet facility in the first quarter of 2007, as well as lower volumes in the distribution, automotive and commercial transportation markets. ATOI for the Flat-Rolled Products segment fell 87% in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly the result of continued higher direct materials, energy, and other cost increases and lower volumes across all businesses, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. ATOI for this segment declined 16% in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to cost increases for direct materials and energy; higher ramp-up costs at facilities in both Russia and China; and the impact of distributor de-stocking in the second half of 2007; somewhat offset by favorable pricing and product mix, and higher volumes in the markets noted previously. In 2009, the weakness in most end markets is expected to continue resulting in declining volumes while lower input costs, such as direct materials and energy, are anticipated. Also, the Global Foil business will be divested. Engineered Products and Solutions 2008 2007 2006 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 182 207 227 Third-party sales $ 5,602 $ 5,251 $ 4,877 ATOI $ 503 $ 409 $ 356 This segment includes titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; forgings and fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems; and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, and power generation markets. These products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. In 2008, the EES business was classified as discontinued operations; therefore, all periods presented exclude the results of this business. Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment increased 7% in 2008 compared with 2007. The improvement was primarily due to higher demand in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets; favorable pricing in the building and construction market; positive foreign currency movements due to a stronger Euro; and the addition of two fastener businesses acquired early in 2008; all of which was partially offset by significant volume declines in the commercial transportation market. Third-party sales for this segment increased 8% in 2007 compared with 2006. The improvement was principally due to aerospace and power generation increases and higher volumes and prices in the building and construction business more than offsetting the decline in commercial transportation. 52 Table of Contents ATOI for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment climbed 23% in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly due to continued strong demand and productivity improvements in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger Euro, and the positive contribution of the acquired fastener businesses, all of which was somewhat offset by significantly lower volumes in the commercial transportation market. ATOI for this segment increased 15% in 2007 compared with 2006, largely due to continued strong demand and operational performance in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets; favorable prices and higher volumes in the building and construction business; and productivity improvements. These positive impacts were partially offset by demand decline in the North America heavy truck market. In 2009, market conditions in the commercial transportation and building and construction markets are expected to further weaken. However, it is anticipated that productivity initiatives will materialize to partially offset the market downturn. Also, the lone remaining Cast Auto Wheels facility will be closed and the Transportation Products Europe business will be divested. Packaging and Consumer 2008 2007 2006 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 19 157 169 Third-party sales $ 516 $ 3,288 $ 3,235 ATOI $ 11 $ 148 $ 95 The businesses within this segment were sold to Rank Group Limited in 2008; therefore, this segment no longer contains any operations. Prior to the sale of these businesses, this segment included consumer, foodservice, and flexible packaging products; food and beverage closures; and plastic sheet and film for the packaging industry. The principal products in this segment included aluminum foil; plastic wraps and bags; plastic beverage and food closures; flexible packaging products; thermoformed plastic containers; and extruded plastic sheet and film. Consumer products were marketed under brands including Reynolds Wrap , Diamond , Baco , and Cut-Rite . Seasonal increases generally occurred in the second and fourth quarters of the year for such products as consumer foil and plastic wraps and bags, while seasonal slowdowns for closures generally occurred in the fourth quarter of the year. Products were generally sold directly to customers, consisting of supermarkets, beverage companies, food processors, retail chains, and commercial foodservice distributors. Third-party sales for the Packaging and Consumer segment increased 2% in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to higher volume and favorable pricing and mix across all businesses. ATOI for the Packaging and Consumer segment climbed 56% in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to productivity improvements across all businesses and the cessation of depreciation beginning in October 2007, as the assets of this segment were classified as held for sale due to management announced intent to actively pursue the sale of these businesses. 53 Table of Contents Reconciliation of ATOI to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income The following table reconciles total segment ATOI to consolidated net (loss) income: 2008 2007 2006 Total segment ATOI $ 2,199 $ 3,162 $ 3,505 Unallocated amounts (net of tax): Impact of LIFO (7 ) (24 ) (170 ) Interest income 35 40 58 Interest expense (265 ) (261 ) (250 ) Minority interests (221 ) (365 ) (436 ) Corporate expense (328 ) (388 ) (317 ) Restructuring and other charges (693 ) (201 ) (347 ) Discontinued operations (303 ) (250 ) 22 Other (491 ) 851 183 Consolidated net (loss) income $ (74 ) $ 2,564 $ 2,248 Items required to reconcile segment ATOI to consolidated net (loss) income include: The impact of LIFO inventory accounting; Interest income and expense; Minority interests; Corporate expense, comprised of general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets; Restructuring and other charges; Discontinued operations; and Other, which includes intersegment profit and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates used in the segments and the corporate effective tax rate, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gains/losses. The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net (loss) income for 2008 compared with 2007 consisted of: A $4 increase in Interest expense, principally caused by a 22% higher average debt level, mostly due to the issuance of $1,500 in new senior notes in July 2008 and significantly higher commercial paper levels; and a decrease in capitalized interest ($21), primarily due to placing growth projects into service, such as the Iceland smelter and the Norway anode facility in 2007; both of which were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($43) and a lower weighted-average effective interest rate, driven mainly by the decrease in LIBOR rates; A $144 decrease in Minority interests, mostly due to lower earnings at AWAC, attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy, unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, and the impact of the gas outage in Western Australia; A $60 decline in Corporate expense, principally due to the absence of transaction costs related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($30); A $492 increase in Restructuring and other charges, primarily due to significantly higher charges for the 2008 restructuring program; A $53 higher loss in Discontinued operations, mainly due to a $51 increase in the net operating loss of the EES business; and 54 Table of Contents A $1,342 change in Other, mostly due to the following: the absence of a $1,140 gain on the sale of the Chalco investment; a net income tax charge of $100 for various items; losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets; and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; all of which was somewhat offset by the absence of a $142 discrete income tax charge related to goodwill that is non-deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses; mark-to-market gains on derivative contracts; and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior Alcoa divestiture ($24). The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net income for 2007 compared with 2006 consisted of: A $146 decrease in the Impact of LIFO, primarily due to a significantly lower increase in metal prices in 2007 as compared to 2006; An $18 decrease in Interest income, mainly due to the absence of $11 in interest earned on a 2006 Brazilian court settlement; An $11 increase in Interest expense, primarily due to $43 in credit facility commitment fees related to the offer for Alcan Inc., partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to construction projects, including the Iceland smelter, the Juruti bauxite mine, the S o Lu refinery expansion, and the Mosj en anode facility; A $71 decrease in Minority interests, principally due to lower earnings at AWAC driven mainly by unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar and a significant increase in energy costs; A $71 increase in Corporate expense, mostly due to $30 in transaction costs related to the offer for Alcan and an increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of reload features of exercised stock options; A $146 decrease in Restructuring and other charges, due to a smaller restructuring program in 2007 as compared to 2006; A change of $272 in Discontinued operations, primarily due to $153 in impairment charges related to the EES business and the absence of a $110 gain recognized on the sale of the home exteriors business in 2006; and A $668 increase in Other, principally due to a $1,140 gain on the sale of the Chalco investment, partially offset by a $142 discrete income tax charge related to goodwill that is non-deductible for tax purposes associated with the planned sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses; the absence of $83 in discrete income tax benefits in 2006 related to the finalization of certain tax reviews and audits and the reversal of valuation allowances related to international net operating losses; the absence of a $26 favorable legal settlement in 2006 related to a former Reynolds distribution business; and an increase in income taxes in order to reconcile the estimated tax rates used in the segments with Alcoa effective tax rate. Environmental Matters Alcoa continues to participate in environmental assessments and cleanups at a number of locations. These include 31 owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, 33 previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and 71 waste sites, including Superfund sites. A liability is recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs or damages can be reasonably estimated. As assessments and cleanups proceed, the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial actions and related costs and damages. The liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, and technological changes. 55 Table of Contents The following discussion provides details regarding the current status of certain significant reserves related to current or former Alcoa sites. Massena, NY Alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the Grasse River, adjacent to Alcoa Massena plant site, under a 1989 order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund. Sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Alcoa submitted various Analysis of Alternatives Reports to the EPA starting in 1998 through 2002 that reported the results of river and sediment studies, potential alternatives for remedial actions related to the PCB contamination, and additional information requested by the EPA. In June 2003, the EPA requested that Alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup. The results of these additional studies, submitted in a report to the EPA in April 2004, suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios. The EPA informed Alcoa that a final remedial decision for the river could not be made without substantially more information, including river pilot studies on the effects of ice formation and breakup on each of the remedial techniques. Alcoa submitted to the EPA, and the EPA approved, a Remedial Options Pilot Study (ROPS) to gather this information. The scope of this study included sediment removal and capping, the installation of an ice control structure, and significant monitoring. From 2004 through 2008, Alcoa completed the work outlined in the ROPS. In November 2008, Alcoa submitted an updated Analysis of Alternatives Report to the EPA incorporating the new information obtained from the ROPS related to the feasibility and costs associated with various capping and dredging alternatives, including options for ice control. As a result, Alcoa increased the reserve associated with the Grasse River by $40 for the estimated costs of a proposed ice control remedy and for partial settlement of potential damages of natural resources. This new information will be used by the EPA to select a remedy for the entire river. The EPA ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability. Alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the EPA Record of Decision is issued, which is expected in 2009 or later. Sherwin, TX In connection with the sale of the Sherwin alumina refinery, which was required to be divested as part of the Reynolds merger in 2000, Alcoa agreed to retain responsibility for the remediation of the then existing environmental conditions, as well as a pro rata share of the final closure of the active waste disposal areas, which remain in use. Alcoa share of the closure costs is proportional to the total period of operation of the active waste disposal areas. Alcoa estimated its liability for the active disposal areas by making certain assumptions about the period of operation, the amount of material placed in the area prior to closure, and the appropriate technology, engineering, and regulatory status applicable to final closure. East St. Louis, IL In response to questions regarding environmental conditions at the former East St. Louis operations, Alcoa and the City of East St. Louis, the owner of the site, entered into an administrative order with the EPA in December 2002 to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study of an area used for the disposal of bauxite residue from historic alumina refining operations. A draft feasibility study was submitted to the EPA in April 2005. The feasibility study included remedial alternatives that ranged from no further action to significant grading, stabilization, and water management of the bauxite residue disposal areas. As a result, Alcoa increased the environmental reserve for this location by $15 in 2005. The EPA ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability. Alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the EPA Record of Decision is issued, which is expected late in 2009 or later. Vancouver, WA In 1987, Alcoa sold its Vancouver smelter to a company that is now known as Evergreen Aluminum (Evergreen). The purchase and sale agreement contained a provision that Alcoa retain liability for any environmental issues that arise subsequent to the sale that pre-date 1987. As a result of this obligation, Alcoa recorded a reserve for the Vancouver location at that time. Evergreen decommissioned the smelter and cleaned up its portion of 56 Table of Contents the site under a consent order with the Washington Department of Ecology (WDE). In February 2008, Evergreen notified Alcoa that it had identified numerous areas containing contamination that predated 1987. Separately, in September 2008, Alcoa completed a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) under the Washington State Model Toxics Control Act and negotiated a consent decree with WDE, which requires Alcoa to complete cleanup of PCB contaminated sediments in the Columbia River as well as remediate soil contamination in upland portions of the Vancouver property. Late in 2008, Alcoa started cleanup work on the Columbia River and discovered additional contamination and waste materials along the shoreline area and in upland areas. In addition, Evergreen presented additional cost estimates for contaminated areas that were discovered since March 2008. As a result of all of the above items related to the former Vancouver site, Alcoa increased the environmental reserve by $16 in 2008. As cleanup work progresses and final remedies are negotiated with WDE, a subsequent reserve adjustment may be necessary. Based on the foregoing, it is possible that Alcoa financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, in a particular period, could be materially affected by matters relating to these sites. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that adequate reserves have been provided and that the disposition of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial position, liquidity, or the results of operations of the Company. Alcoa remediation reserve balance was $316 and $279 at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (of which $39 and $51 was classified as a current liability), respectively, and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated. In 2008, the remediation reserve was increased by $69, mostly due to the adjustments related to the Grasse River and former Vancouver property discussed above. In 2007, the remediation reserve was decreased by $10 consisting of a $15 adjustment for the liabilities associated with a previously owned smelter site and a $5 adjustment for liabilities at the Russian rolling mills and extrusion plants, both of which were partially offset by a net increase of $10 in liabilities associated with various locations. The $15 and $5 adjustments were made after further investigations were completed and Alcoa was able to obtain additional information about the environmental condition and the associated liabilities related to these sites. The changes to the remediation reserve were recorded in Cost of goods sold on the Statement of Consolidated Operations in both periods. Payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were $32 and $30 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. These amounts include expenditures currently mandated, as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third party. Included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental programs. These costs are estimated to be approximately 2% of cost of goods sold. Liquidity and Capital Resources Alcoa takes a very disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. Management faced the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the Company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively, especially in the second half of 2008. In response to recent changes in the economic markets across the globe, management reacted quickly to solidify Alcoa liquidity position. The following actions were initiated in the second half of 2008 to conserve cash and preserve liquidity: greater scrutiny over the daily management of Alcoa cash position; higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels; targeted headcount reductions across the globe; a salary and hiring freeze at the Corporate level; suspension of the existing share repurchase program; and the addition of a new 364-day $1,900 revolving credit facility. A number of changes were also made to Alcoa capital expenditures strategy as follows: capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically; growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible; and all non-critical capital expenditures were stopped. Capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain Alcoa compliance with the law, keep a facility operating, or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs. The planned sale 57 Table of Contents or shutdown of various businesses will also contribute positively to Alcoa liquidity position in 2009. Along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Alcoa current operational and business needs. For a discussion of long-term liquidity, see the disclosures included in Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Cash from Operations Cash from operations in 2008 was $1,234 compared with $3,111 in 2007, resulting in a decrease of $1,877, or 60%. The decline of $1,877 was primarily due to a decrease in earnings after taking into account non-cash income and expenses; a $988 cash outflow associated with working capital; $201 in higher pension contributions; and the absence of $93 in cash received on a long-term aluminum supply contract. These cash outflows were slightly offset by a $336 cash inflow related to noncurrent assets and liabilities and a $97 increase in cash provided from discontinued operations. The major components of the $988 change in working capital are as follows: a $351 smaller decrease in receivables, primarily as a result of improved sales from most businesses not classified as held for sale; a $522 increase in inventories, mostly due to higher costs of raw materials and other inputs; a $156 smaller increase in accounts payable, trade; a $209 decrease in accrued expenses; and a $213 increase in taxes, including taxes on income. Cash from operations in 2007 was $3,111 compared with $2,567 in 2006, resulting in an increase of $544, or 21%. The improvement of $544 is principally related to a $1,415 positive change associated with working capital, primarily due to improvements in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable and accrued expenses; higher net income of $316; and a cash inflow of $93 related to a long-term aluminum supply contract. These positive impacts were partially offset by a significant increase in non-cash adjustments, mostly related to the sale of the Chalco investment. Financing Activities Cash provided from financing activities was $1,478 in 2008 compared with cash used for financing activities of $1,538 in 2007. The change of $3,016 was primarily due to a $1,414 reduction in the repurchase of common stock, mainly the result of the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program; a $1,296 change in commercial paper, principally due to an increase in commercial paper issued and the absence of a $1,132 reduction of commercial paper with the proceeds from newly-issued long-term debt in January 2007; and a $669 decrease in payments on long-term debt, mostly due to the purchase ($333) and repayment ($459) of 4.25% Notes due August 2007, as compared to the repayment of $150 in 6.625% Notes due March 2008. These cash inflows were somewhat offset by a $658 decline in common stock issued for compensation plans, primarily due to fewer stock option exercises as result of the significant decline in the market price of Alcoa common stock. Cash used for financing activities was $1,538 in 2007 compared with $20 in 2006. The change of $1,518 was primarily due to a $2,206 increase in the repurchase of common stock due to a significant increase in the number of shares repurchased as a result of the January 2007 and October 2007 authorized programs; a $1,177 change in the net change in commercial paper, mostly due to the repayment of commercial paper with the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of new long-term debt in 2007; an $837 increase in payments on long-term debt, primarily related to the January 2007 purchase of $333 of outstanding 4.25% Notes due August 2007 and the repayment of the remaining $459 of outstanding 4.25% Notes in August 2007; $126 in payments for debt issuance costs, including a commitment fee of $30 paid to secure a credit facility related to the offer for Alcan Inc.; and a $66 increase in dividends paid to shareholders as a result of the eight cents per share annual increase approved in January 2007. Partially offsetting these cash inflows was a $2,021 increase in additions to long-term debt, principally due to proceeds received of $1,994 (net of $6 in original issue discounts) from the issuance of new 5.55% Notes due 2017, 5.9% Notes due 2027, and 5.95% Notes due 2037; a $679 increase in common stock issued for stock compensation plans related to cash received for the exercise of stock options; and a $132 increase in minority interest contributions, primarily from an increase in contributions received from Alumina Limited, related to their share of capital spending at the S o Lu and Juruti facilities. In October 2007, Alcoa entered into a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2007 (the Credit Agreement ), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. The Credit Agreement provides a $3,250 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working 58 Table of Contents capital or for other general corporate purposes of Alcoa, including support of Alcoa commercial paper program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sub-limit of $500 under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility matures on October 2, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Alcoa may make two one-year extension requests during the term of the Credit Facility, with any extension being subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Alcoa. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or Euros. Loans will bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Alcoa outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 0.33% per annum based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings, as of December 31, 2008. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The Credit Facility replaces $3,000 in aggregate principal amount of revolving credit facilities maintained by Alcoa under the following credit agreements, which were terminated effective October 2, 2007: (i) $1,000 Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of April 22, 2005, (ii) $1,000 Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of April 23, 2004, as amended, and (iii) $1,000 Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of April 25, 2003, as amended (collectively, the Former Credit Agreements ). The Credit Agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the Former Credit Agreements, including, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on Alcoa ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on Alcoa ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets and (d) limitations on Alcoa ability to change the nature of its business. The obligation of Alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Alcoa failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Alcoa in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Alcoa breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Alcoa. In July 2008, Alcoa increased the capacity of the Credit Facility by $175 as provided for under the Credit Agreement. In October 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (LCPI), a lender under the Credit Agreement with $150 in commitments, filed for bankruptcy protection under section 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. It is not certain if LCPI will honor its obligations under the Credit Agreement. The total capacity of the Credit Facility, excluding LCPI commitment, is $3,275. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2008 and 2007. In January 2008, Alcoa entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA-1) with two financial institutions. RCA-1 provided a $1,000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF-1), with a stated maturity of March 28, 2008. RCA-1 contained a provision that if there were amounts borrowed under RCF-1 at the time Alcoa received the proceeds from the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses, the company must use the net cash proceeds to prepay the amount outstanding under RCF-1. Additionally, upon Alcoa receipt of such proceeds, the lenders commitments under RCF-1 would be reduced by a corresponding amount, up to the total commitments then in effect under RCF-1, regardless of whether there was an amount outstanding under RCF-1. In February 2008, Alcoa borrowed $1,000 under RCF-1 and used the proceeds to reduce outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Subsequent to the $1,000 borrowing, Alcoa completed the sale of its Packaging and Consumer businesses in February 2008. As a result, Alcoa also repaid the $1,000 under RCF-1 in February 2008, and the lenders commitments under RCF-1 were reduced to zero effectively terminating RCA-1. 59 Table of Contents Also in January 2008, Alcoa entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA-2) with LCPI, as administrative agent, and Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank (LBCB), as lender. RCA-2 provided a $1,000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF-2), which would have matured on January 31, 2009. In October 2008, LCPI filed for bankruptcy protection under section 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. To Alcoa knowledge, LBCB has not filed for bankruptcy protection. As a result, in October 2008, Alcoa gave notice in accordance with the provisions of RCA-2 to permanently terminate in whole LBCB total commitments under RCF-2 effective October 30, 2008. On October 14, 2008, Alcoa entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA-3) with a syndicate of lenders. RCA-3 provides a $1,150 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF-3), which matures on October 12, 2009. Loans will bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR, plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Alcoa outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on base rate and LIBOR loans will be 1.375% and 1.875%, respectively, per annum based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings, as of December 31, 2008. Alcoa will also pay a facility fee, currently 0.375%, on the aggregate commitments, whether used or unused, based on its long-term debt ratings. Additionally, if there is an amount outstanding under RCF-3 on the last calendar day of any of the next three quarterly periods, Alcoa will pay a duration fee to the lenders. The duration fee is equal to 0.5% of such outstanding amount on the respective day starting on December 31, 2008 and increases by 0.5% each quarter thereafter. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. RCA-3 also provides for a mandatory prepayment, not to exceed the amount outstanding under RCF-3 at such time, equal to 100% of the net proceeds Alcoa receives from certain future debt or equity issuances in capital markets transactions or 50% of the net proceeds Alcoa receives from asset sales (other than those in the ordinary course of business), if the proceeds from all asset sales exceed $50. Any prepayments made related to the net proceeds from assets sales or that would have been made if amounts were outstanding under RCF-3 also reduce the lenders commitments by a corresponding amount. Amounts payable under RCF-3 will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Alcoa. RCA-3 includes the following covenants, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on Alcoa ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on Alcoa ability to consummate a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (d) limitations on Alcoa ability to change the nature of its business. The obligation of Alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under RCF-3 may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in RCA-3. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Alcoa failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under RCF-3, (b) any representation or warranty of Alcoa in RCA-3 proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Alcoa breach of any of its covenants contained in RCA-3, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Alcoa. In October and November 2008, Alcoa increased the capacity of RCF-3 by $500 and $250, respectively, as provided for under RCA-3. Alcoa paid a total of $43 in financing costs, which were deferred and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the facility, for the initial capacity under RCF-3 as well as for the $750 in increased capacity. There were no amounts outstanding under RCF-3 at December 31, 2008. In March 2008, Alcoa filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance. This shelf registration statement replaced Alcoa existing shelf registration statement. As of December 31, 2008, $1,500 in senior debt securities were issued under the new shelf registration statement. Standard and Poor Ratings Services (S&P) long-term debt rating of Alcoa is BBB+ and its short-term debt rating is A-2. The current outlook, which was revised in October 2008 (placed on negative creditwatch in January 2009), is negative, as S&P cited weaker than expected earnings, the result of falling aluminum prices, and weak end markets coupled with large capital spending and share repurchases (the existing share repurchase program has been temporarily suspended). Moody Investors Service (Moody s) long-term debt rating of Alcoa is Baa1 and its short-term debt rating of Alcoa is Prime-2. The current outlook, which was revised in October 2008 (placed on negative creditwatch in December 2008), is negative, as Moody cited weak aluminum end markets. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term debt 60 Table of Contents rating of Alcoa is BBB and its short-term debt rating is F2. The current outlook, which was revised in April 2008 and affirmed in October 2008, is stable, as Fitch cited current aluminum market conditions and Alcoa operating flexibility. See Note Y to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update to these credit ratings and outlooks that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2008. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was $2,410 in 2008 compared with $1,625 in 2007. The increase in cash used of $785 was mainly due to a decline of $1,939 in sales of investments, as a result of the absence of the $1,942 in proceeds received from the sale of the Chalco investment; a $1,172 increase in additions to investments, due to the $1,200 investment made in Shining Prospect Pte. Ltd. to acquire common stock of Rio Tinto plc; and a $399 rise in acquisitions, including minority interests, driven by the purchase of two aerospace fastener manufacturing businesses for $276, the buyout of the outstanding minority interest in Bohai for $79, and a $47 contingent payment made to Camargo Corr a Group related to the 2003 acquisition of 40.9% of Alcoa Alum nio S.A. These cash outflows were principally offset by a $2,527 increase in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, mostly related to the $2,651 in net proceeds received from the sale of the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment. Cash used for investing activities was $1,625 in 2007 compared with $2,841 in 2006. The decrease in cash used of $1,216 was primarily due to a $1,976 increase in sales of investments, mostly related to the $1,942 in proceeds received from the sale of the Chalco investment. This cash inflow was partially offset by a $431 increase in capital expenditures, principally related to higher spending on certain growth projects, including the S o Lu refinery expansion; the development of the Juruti bauxite mine; and projects at various facilities in Russia, Hungary, and China; all of which were partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to the Iceland smelter and the Mosj en anode facility, as these two projects were placed in service during 2007, and the Early Works Program in Jamaica, as this project was completed near the end of 2006; and a decrease of $189 in proceeds from the sales of assets and businesses, principally due to the $305 in cash received for the sale of the home exteriors business in 2006 as compared to the $70 and $33 in cash received from the sales of a mine in Texas and the Automotive Castings business, respectively, in 2007. Capital expenditures were $3,438 in 2008 compared with $3,636 and $3,205 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of the total capital expenditures in 2008, approximately 58% related to growth projects, including the refinery expansion in S o Lu s, the development of the Juruti bauxite mine, the Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil, and projects at various facilities in Russia and China. Also included are costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities totaling $241 in 2008, $274 in 2007, and $182 in 2006. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,800 in 2009, approximately half of which is expected to occur in the first half of 2009 related to the S o Lu refinery expansion and the development of the Juruti bauxite mine. Alcoa added $1,303, $131, and $58, to its investments in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. As noted above, in 2008, Alcoa invested $1,200 in Shining Prospect Pte. Ltd. to acquire common stock of Rio Tinto plc. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, Alcoa invested an additional $9, $31, and $26, respectively, in the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline in Western Australia. Also in 2008, Alcoa made additional investments related to its Serra do Fac o hydroelectric power project in Brazil. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities; environmental matters; asset retirement obligations; the testing of goodwill, equity investments, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimated proceeds on businesses to be divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits; stock-based compensation; and income taxes. 61 Table of Contents Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A discussion of the judgments, estimates, assumptions, and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and environmental matters can be found in the Market Risks and Derivative Activities and the Environmental Matters sections, respectively. A summary of the Company significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company operating results and financial condition. Asset Retirement Obligations. Alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of Alcoa bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting facilities. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal, closure of bauxite residue areas, mine reclamation, and landfill closure. Alcoa also recognizes AROs for any significant lease restoration obligation, if required by a lease agreement, and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred, and accreted over time for the change in present value. Additionally, Alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) related to alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. A CARO is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within Alcoa control. Such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures, maintenance and upgrade programs, and other factors. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made, Alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal, treatment, transportation, storage and (or) disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos, underground and aboveground storage tanks, PCBs, various process residuals, solid wastes, electronic equipment waste and various other materials. Such amounts may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are recorded. If Alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately, the estimated CARO as of December 31, 2008 ranges from less than $1 to $52 per structure (157 structures) in today dollars. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, or slower growth rates, among others. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Alcoa has 10 reporting units, of which three are included in the Flat-Rolled Products segment and five are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. The remaining two reporting units are the Alumina and Primary Metals segments. Almost 90% of Alcoa total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows: Alcoa Fastening Systems (AFS) ($1,014) and Alcoa Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,601) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, and Primary Metals ($1,767). These amounts include an allocation of Corporate goodwill. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the current fair value of its 62 Table of Contents reporting units when testing for impairment. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years cash flows and historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts. In 2008, the estimated fair value of nine of the ten reporting units, including AFS and APP, were well in excess of the carrying value of these businesses resulting in no impairment. For Primary Metals, while the estimated fair value of this business exceeded its carrying value, the excess was significantly impacted due to the historic drop in the LME price that occurred in the second half of 2008. Management performed an updated goodwill impairment test for Primary Metals in late December 2008, which again resulted in no impairment (the tests for the other nine reporting units were also updated). Historically, LME pricing levels and the corresponding input costs (e.g., raw materials, energy) have generally trended in the same manner, resulting in relatively consistent cash margins over time. As a result, the estimated fair value of Primary Metals traditionally has been well in excess of its carrying value. However, during the second half of 2008, the LME price decreased at an unprecedented rate, significantly outpacing any decreases in associated input costs. As a result of this near-term disruption in the historical relationship between LME and input costs, the expected cash margins in the early years in the DCF model were lower than normal and lower than long-term expectations. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity. With Alcoa common stock price at extraordinary lows late in 2008, management analyzed the valuations derived from the DCF models in relation to Alcoa market capitalization. In management judgment, a significant portion of the recent decline in Alcoa stock price is related to the current unprecedented liquidity crisis in the overall economy and is not reflective of the underlying cash flows of the reporting units. As a result, management believes the Company forecasted cash flows constitute a better indicator of the current fair value of Alcoa reporting units than the current pricing of its common shares. The sum of the individual estimated fair values of Alcoa reporting units per the DCF models is greater than the market value of Alcoa common stock. However, fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Equity investments. Alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortiums. These investments are accounted for on the equity method and include the Company investment in Shining Prospect Pte. Ltd. The equity method is applied in situations where Alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired. The following items are examples of impairment indicators: significant, sustained declines in an investee revenue, earnings, and cash flow trends; adverse market conditions of the investee industry or geographic area; the investee ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity; and other factors. Once an impairment indicator is identified, management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary, in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value. An impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations. 63 Table of Contents Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age, and mortality). The rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% is approximately $325 and either a charge or credit of $16 to after-tax earnings in the following year. The long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of assets. A change in the assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $15 for 2009. Although the 10-year moving average of actual performance fell below 9% for the first time in 20 years, the 20-year moving average has continued to exceed 9%. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be reduced to 8.75% for 2009 reflecting recent market conditions. In 2008, a net charge of $2,181 ($1,374 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of plan assets, which was somewhat offset by the decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation (as a result of a 20 basis-point increase in the discount rate) and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. Additionally, a charge of $8 was recorded in other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy. In 2007, a net credit of $659 ($426 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive income due to a net decrease in the accumulated benefit obligations (as a result of a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, which was partially offset by plan amendments) and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. Additionally, a credit of $80 was recorded in other comprehensive income due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy. Stock-based Compensation. Alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of each new stock option is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, and exercise behavior. If any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted. As part of Alcoa stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. Equity grants are issued in January each year. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first and second quarters of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $94 ($63 after-tax), $97 ($63 after-tax), and $72 ($48 64 Table of Contents after-tax), respectively. Of this amount, $19, $19, and $20 in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. On December 31, 2005, Alcoa accelerated the vesting of 11 million unvested stock options granted to employees in 2004 and on January 13, 2005. The 2004 and 2005 accelerated options had weighted average exercise prices of $35.60 and $29.54, respectively, and in the aggregate represented approximately 12% of Alcoa total outstanding options. The decision to accelerate the vesting of the 2004 and 2005 options was made primarily to avoid recognizing the related compensation expense in future Consolidated Financial Statements upon the adoption of a new accounting standard. The accelerated vesting of the 2004 and 2005 stock options reduced Alcoa after-tax stock option compensation expense in 2007 and 2006 by $7 and $21, respectively. Beginning in 2006, plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Alcoa assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open, or the statute of limitation expires. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Alcoa also has unamortized tax-deductible goodwill of $397 resulting from intercompany stock sales and reorganizations (generally at a 30% to 34% rate). Alcoa recognizes the tax benefits associated with this tax-deductible goodwill as it is being amortized for local income tax purposes rather than in the period in which the transaction is consummated. Related Party Transactions Alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of entities in which Alcoa retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated arms-length prices between the two parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Alcoa for all periods presented. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards On January 1, 2008, Alcoa adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis (the fair value option) with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Alcoa already records marketable securities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and derivative contracts and hedging activities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). The adoption of SFAS 159 had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements as management did not elect the fair value option for any other financial instruments or certain other assets and liabilities. On January 1, 2008, Alcoa adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157) as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities. In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delayed the effective date of 65 Table of Contents SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis, until January 1, 2009 for calendar year-end entities. Also in February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13, which states that SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, (SFAS 13) and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under SFAS 13 are excluded from the provisions of SFAS 157, except for assets and liabilities related to leases assumed in a business combination that are required to be measured at fair value under SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141) or SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. The adoption of SFAS 157, as it relates to financial assets, had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has determined that the adoption of SFAS 157, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, will not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This standard is now the single source in GAAP for the definition of fair value, except for the fair value of leased property as defined in SFAS 13. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157 are described below: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. The following sections describe the valuation methodologies used by Alcoa to measure different financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified. Where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models, the key inputs to those models, and any significant assumptions. Available-for-sale securities. Alcoa uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of available-for-sale securities. These financial instruments consist of exchange-traded fixed income and equity securities, and are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivative contracts. Derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable and unobservable inputs. Such financial instruments consist of aluminum, interest rate, commodity (principally energy-related), and foreign currency contracts. The fair values for the majority of these derivative contracts are based upon current quoted market prices. These financial instruments are typically exchange-traded and are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether the exchange is deemed to be an active market or not. 66 Table of Contents For certain derivative contracts whose fair values are based upon trades in liquid markets, such as aluminum options, valuation model inputs can generally be verified and valuation techniques do not involve significant management judgment. The fair values of such financial instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Alcoa has other derivative contracts that do not have observable market quotes. For these financial instruments, management uses significant other observable inputs (i.e., information concerning time premiums and volatilities for certain option type embedded derivatives and regional premiums for swaps). For periods beyond the term of quoted market prices for aluminum, Alcoa uses a macroeconomic model that estimates the long-term price of aluminum based on anticipated changes in worldwide supply and demand. Where appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads, and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 2). In the absence of such evidence, management best estimate is used (Level 3). The following table presents Alcoa assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2008: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Collateral* Total Assets: Available-for-sale securities $ 27 $ - $ - $ - $ 27 Derivative contracts 79 160 - (67 ) 172 Total assets $ 106 $ 160 $ - $ (67 ) $ 199 Liabilities: Derivative contracts $ 569 $ 30 $ 341 $ (119 ) $ 821 * These amounts represent cash collateral paid ($119) and held ($67) that Alcoa elected to net against the fair value amounts recognized for certain derivative instruments executed with the same counterparties under master netting arrangements. This election was made under the provisions of FSP FIN 39-1, which was adopted by Alcoa on January 1, 2008 (see below). The collateral paid of $119 relates to derivative contracts for aluminum included in Level 1 and the collateral held of $67 relates to derivative contracts for interest rates included in Level 2. Financial instruments classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent derivative contracts in which management has used at least one significant unobservable input in the valuation model. The following table presents a reconciliation of activity for such derivative contracts on a net basis: Year ended December 31, 2008 Balance at beginning of period $ 408 Total realized/unrealized (losses) or gains included in: Sales (54 ) Cost of goods sold 3 Other comprehensive loss (35 ) Purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements 19 Transfers in and (or) out of Level 3 - Balance at end of period $ 341 Total (losses) or gains included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to derivative contracts still held at December 31, 2008: Sales $ (54 ) Cost of goods sold 3 67 Table of Contents As reflected in the table above, the net unrealized loss on derivative contracts using Level 3 valuation techniques was $341 as of December 31, 2008. This loss is mainly attributed to embedded derivatives in a power contract that index the price of power to the LME price of aluminum. These embedded derivatives are primarily valued using observable market prices. However, due to the length of the contract, the valuation model also requires management to estimate the long-term price of aluminum based upon anticipated changes in worldwide supply and demand. The embedded derivatives have been designated as hedges of forward sales of aluminum and their realized gains and losses are included in Sales on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Also, included within Level 3 measurements are derivative financial instruments that hedge the cost of electricity. Transactions involving on-peak power are observable as there is an active market. However, due to Alcoa power consumption, there are certain off-peak times when there is not an actively traded market for electricity. Therefore, management utilizes various forecast services, historical relationships, and near term market actual pricing to determine the fair value. Gains and losses realized for the electricity contracts are included in Cost of goods sold on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Additionally, an embedded derivative in a power contract that indexes the difference between the long-term debt ratings of Alcoa and the counterparty from any of the three major credit rating agencies is included in Level 3. Management uses forecast services, historical relationships, and market prices to determine fair value. None of the Level 3 positions on hand at December 31, 2008 resulted in any unrealized gains in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Effective September 30, 2008, Alcoa adopted FSP No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157-3), which was issued on October 10, 2008. FSP FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The adoption of FSP FAS 157-3 had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2008, Alcoa adopted FSP No. FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39, (FSP FIN 39-1). FSP FIN 39-1 amends FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts, by permitting entities that enter into master netting arrangements as part of their derivative transactions to offset in their financial statements net derivative positions against the fair value of amounts (or amounts that approximate fair value) recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral under those arrangements. As a result, management elected to net cash collateral against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty when a master netting arrangement exists. The provisions of FSP FIN 39-1 are to be applied retroactively for all financial statement periods presented. As of December 31, 2008, the obligation to return cash collateral in the amount of $67 was netted against the fair value of derivative contracts, of which $4 is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and $63 is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the right to receive cash collateral in the amount of $119 was netted against the fair value of derivative contracts included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 did not impact the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 as no cash collateral was held or posted. On January 1, 2008, Alcoa adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-10, Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, (EITF 06-10). Under the provisions of EITF 06-10, an employer is required to recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangement in accordance with either SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, or Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 12, Omnibus Opinion 1967, if the employer has agreed to maintain a life insurance policy during the employee retirement or provide the employee with a death benefit based on the substantive arrangement with the employee. The provisions of EITF 06-10 also require an employer to recognize and measure the asset in a collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangement based on the nature and substance of the arrangement. The adoption of EITF 06-10 had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2008, Alcoa adopted Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. E23, Hedging General: Issues Involving the Application of the Shortcut Method under Paragraph 68 (Issue E23). Issue E23 provides guidance on certain practice issues related to the application of the shortcut method by amending paragraph 68 of SFAS 133 with respect to the conditions that must be met in order to apply the shortcut method for assessing hedge effectiveness of 68 Table of Contents interest rate swaps. In addition to applying the provisions of Issue E23 on hedging arrangements designated on or after January 1, 2008, an assessment was required to be made on January 1, 2008 to determine whether preexisting hedging arrangements met the provisions of Issue E23 as of their original inception. Management performed such an assessment and determined that the adoption of Issue E23 had no impact on preexisting hedging arrangements. Alcoa will apply the provisions of Issue E23 on future hedging arrangements so designated. On January 1, 2007, Alcoa adopted FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements, uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. This Interpretation requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Effective January 1, 2007, Alcoa adopted FSP No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48, (FSP FIN 48-1), which was issued on May 2, 2007. FSP FIN 48-1 amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The term effectively settled replaces the term ultimately settled when used to describe recognition, and the terms settlement or settled replace the terms ultimate settlement or ultimately settled when used to describe measurement of a tax position under FIN 48. FSP FIN 48-1 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The adoption of FIN 48 and FSP FIN 48-1 did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the required disclosures in accordance with the provisions of FIN 48. Alcoa adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), (SFAS 158), effective December 31, 2006. SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. Following the adoption of SFAS 158, additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are no longer recognized. The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in the following impacts: a reduction of $119 in existing prepaid pension costs and intangible assets, the recognition of $1,234 in accrued pension and postretirement liabilities, and a charge of $1,353 ($877 after-tax) to accumulated other comprehensive loss. Additionally, SFAS 158 requires an employer to measure the funded status of each of its plans as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. This provision became effective for Alcoa for its December 31, 2008 year-end and resulted in a charge of $9, which was recorded as an adjustment to December 31, 2008 retained earnings. Prior to the effective date of this provision, the funded status of most of Alcoa pension and other postretirement benefit plans were already measured as of December 31st. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, (SAB 108). SAB 108 was issued to provide interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The provisions of SAB 108 were effective for Alcoa for its December 31, 2006 year-end. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on Alcoa Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2006, Alcoa adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , (SFAS 123(R)), which requires the company to recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair 69 Table of Contents value. SFAS 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Alcoa elected the modified prospective application method for adoption, and prior period financial statements have not been restated. As a result of the implementation of SFAS 123(R), Alcoa recognized additional compensation expense of $29 ($19 after-tax) in 2006 comprised of $11 ($7 after-tax) and $18 ($12 after-tax) related to stock options and stock awards, respectively. Effective January 1, 2006, Alcoa adopted EITF Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred During Production in the Mining Industry, (EITF 04-6). EITF 04-6 requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are to be accounted for as variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced (that is, extracted) during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Upon adoption, Alcoa recognized a cumulative effect adjustment in the opening balance of retained earnings of $3, representing the reduction in the net book value of post-production stripping costs of $8, offset by a related deferred tax liability of $3 and minority interests of $2. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity derivative and hedging activities, including (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This standard becomes effective for Alcoa on January 1, 2009. Earlier adoption of SFAS 161 and, separately, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption are encouraged. As SFAS 161 only requires enhanced disclosures, management has determined that the adoption of SFAS 161 will not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51, (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This standard defines a noncontrolling interest, sometimes called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. SFAS 160 requires, among other items, that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity separate from the parent equity; consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent and noncontrolling interest shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statement of income; and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value. SFAS 160 becomes effective for Alcoa on January 1, 2009. Management has determined that the adoption of SFAS 160 will not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R), which replaces SFAS 141 and retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS 141, including that the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. This standard defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control instead of the date that the consideration is transferred. SFAS 141(R) requires an acquirer in a business combination, including business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisition), to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions. It also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from certain contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date, measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Additionally, SFAS 141(R) requires acquisition-related costs to be expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received instead of including such costs as part of the acquisition price. SFAS 141(R) becomes effective for Alcoa for any business combination with an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009. 70 Table of Contents Management has determined that the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will result in a charge of $18 ($12 after-tax) in the Statement of Consolidated Operations for the write off of third-party costs related to potential business acquisitions. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, (FSP FAS 142-3). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS 142) in order to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141(R) and other GAAP. FSP FAS 142-3 becomes effective for Alcoa on January 1, 2009. Management has determined that the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 will not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities, (FSP EITF 03-6-1). FSP EITF 03-6-1 states that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 becomes effective for Alcoa on January 1, 2009. Management has determined that the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 will not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, (FSP FAS 132(R)-1). FSP FAS 132(R)-1 amends SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to provide guidance on an employer disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This guidance is intended to ensure that an employer meets the objectives of the disclosures about plan assets in an employer defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan to provide users of financial statements with an understanding of the following: how investment allocation decisions are made; the major categories of plan assets; the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets; and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 becomes effective for Alcoa on December 31, 2009. As FSP FAS 132(R)-1 only requires enhanced disclosures, management has determined that the adoption of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 71 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations. Alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, debt agreements, and lease agreements. Alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for postretirement benefit plans, and finance capital projects. These contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information. As of December 31, 2008, a summary of Alcoa outstanding contractual obligations is as follows: Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 Thereafter Operating activities: Energy-related purchase obligations $ 19,206 $ 1,002 $ 1,677 $ 1,568 $ 14,959 Raw material purchase obligations 3,135 1,158 1,589 259 129 Other purchase obligations 244 30 88 84 42 Interest related to total debt 5,044 587 955 763 2,739 Operating leases 1,506 398 535 252 321 Estimated minimum required pension funding 2,370 140 1,190 1,040 - Postretirement benefit payments 2,845 295 595 585 1,370 Layoff and other restructuring payments 328 236 92 - - Deferred revenue arrangements 187 47 16 16 108 Uncertain tax positions 34 - - - 34 Financing activities: Total debt 10,578 2,069 1,403 2,148 4,958 Dividends to shareholders - - - - - Investing activities: Capital projects 1,866 1,049 614 203 - Payments related to acquisitions - - - - - Totals $ 47,343 $ 7,011 $ 8,754 $ 6,918 $ 24,660 Obligations for Operating Activities Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 40 years. The majority of raw material and other purchase obligations have expiration dates of 24 months or less. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain computer equipment, plant equipment, vehicles, and buildings. Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2008 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2037. The effect of outstanding interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, are included in interest related to total debt. As of December 31, 2008, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $1,890 of debt through 2018. As the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. The minimum required cash outlays for pension funding are estimated to be $140 for 2009 and $590 for 2010. The increase in the projected funding is the result of a significant decline in the fair value of plan assets and the reduction of available pension funding credits from 2009 to 2010. The funding estimate is $600 for 2011, $530 for 2012 and $510 for 2013. The expected pension contributions in 2009 and later reflect the impacts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 that was signed into law on August 17, 2006. Pension contributions are expected to decline beginning in 2014 if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future. Postretirement 72 Table of Contents benefit payments are expected to approximate $300 annually, net of the estimated subsidy receipts related to Medicare Part D, and are reflected in the preceding table through 2018. Alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and postretirement benefit payments beyond 2013 and 2018, respectively. Layoff and other restructuring payments primarily relate to severance costs and are expected to be paid within one year. Amounts scheduled to be paid greater than one year are related to ongoing site remediation work, special termination benefit payments, and lease termination costs. Deferred revenue arrangements require Alcoa to deliver aluminum and alumina over the specified contract period. While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made. The longest such contract expires in 2027. Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2008. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. Obligations for Financing Activities Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings, commercial paper and long-term debt. Maturities for long-term debt extend to 2037. The company has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Alcoa paid $556 in dividends to shareholders during 2008. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Alcoa Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table until such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2008, there were 800,317,368 and 546,024 shares of common stock and preferred stock outstanding, respectively. In January 2007, Alcoa increased its annual common stock dividend from $0.60 per share to $0.68 per share. Obligations for Investing Activities Alcoa has made announcements indicating its participation in several significant expansion projects. These projects include the expansion of an alumina refinery in S o Luis; the development of a bauxite mine in Juruti; global rolled products expansion projects in Russia and China; and the continued investment in several hydroelectric power projects in Brazil. These projects are in various stages of development and, depending on business and (or) regulatory circumstances, may not be completed. The amounts included in the preceding table for capital projects represent the amounts that have been approved by management for these and other projects as of December 31, 2008. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is anticipated that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Alcoa anticipates that financing required to execute all of these investments will be readily available over the time frame required. Including the previously mentioned growth projects, total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,800 in 2009. Payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from Alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. Amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. In connection with an acquisition made prior to 2006, Alcoa could be required to make additional contingent payments of approximately $85 through 2015, but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard. 73 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2008, Alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of $230. These guarantees expire in 2015 through 2018 and relate to project financing for hydroelectric power projects in Brazil. Alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to legal, customs duties, and leasing obligations, among others, which expire at various dates, that total $389 at December 31, 2008. Alcoa has outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $600 as of December 31, 2008. These letters of credit relate primarily to workers compensation, derivative contracts, and leasing obligations, and expire at various dates mostly in 2009. Alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to customs duties, self-insurance, and legal obligations. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates in 2009, was $41 at December 31, 2008. In November 2007, Alcoa entered into a program to sell a senior undivided interest in certain customer receivables, without recourse, on a continuous basis to a third-party for cash. In August 2008, Alcoa increased the capacity of this program from $100 to $250. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, Alcoa received $250 and $100, respectively, in cash proceeds, which reduced Receivables from customers on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Alcoa services the customer receivables for the third-party at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. Alcoa had an existing program with a different third-party to sell certain customer receivables. The sale of receivables under this program was conducted through a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE) that was bankruptcy remote, and, therefore, was not consolidated by Alcoa. Effective August 31, 2008, Alcoa terminated this program and all outstanding accounts receivable were collected by the QSPE through the end of 2008. As of December 31, 2007, Alcoa sold trade receivables of $139 to the QSPE.
