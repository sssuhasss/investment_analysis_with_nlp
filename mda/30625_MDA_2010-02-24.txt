ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. Please see Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements sections for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ( QRCs ), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. We currently employ approximately 15,000 employees in more than 50 countries. Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings, as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is served by more than 150 of our QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value added services, and is generally a higher margin business and a key component of our profitable growth. Through December 31, 2009, our operations were conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ): Flowserve Pump Division ( FPD ): engineered and industrial pumps, pump systems, submersible motors and related services; Flow Control Division ( FCD ): engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators, controls and related services; and Flow Solutions Division ( FSD ): mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and parts and related services. Our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. The products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering and construction firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. We continue to build on our geographic breadth through our QRC network with the goal to be positioned as near to the customers as possible for service and support in order to capture this important aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. We continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products. Significant efforts are underway to improve the supply chain processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands. We continue to focus on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of 30 Table of Contents sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused CIP initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. We experienced reduced demand for original equipment in 2009 as compared with 2008. This was a result of the impact from the global financial crisis and economic recession. Many of our oil and gas customers postponed major capital decisions from their original initiation dates in order to reevaluate the viability of the project, take advantage of the cost reduction in commodities, such as steel, or to better align the start up of operations with revised demand growth forecasts. In the chemical market, capital spending was reduced due to the adverse effects this industry experienced from the significant drop in consumer demand and the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) decline of many economic regions. Both the power generation and water management markets showed resiliency in their capital spending due to government stimulus investments, management of existing operations and the necessity to build infrastructure for developing markets. Capital spending directed at improving and optimizing existing operations provided growth opportunities across all of these industries in 2009, and the developing regions of the world continued capital investments despite the challenging global economy. In 2009, we experienced stable conditions in our global aftermarket business. The demand growth in past years provided us the opportunity to increase our installed base of new products and drive recurring aftermarket sales. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings, as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods. In 2009, we continued to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of the global market to capture these aftermarket opportunities. We believe that with our customer relationships, our global presence and our highly regarded technical capabilities, we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries; however, we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multinational presence, such as economic, political, currency and other risks. Our Markets The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Outlook for 2010 section included in this MD&A. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas; chemical; power generation; water management; and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries. Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas, power and water, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. Our customers include engineering contractors, original equipment manufacturers, end users and distributors. Sales to engineering contractors and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as book and ship, is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped within three months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our pumps, valves and seals, which require maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global 31 Table of Contents network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to expand our global QRC network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 36% and 39% of our bookings in 2009 and 2008, respectively, experienced a measurable decline in new orders placed in 2009. Many of our clients postponed major projects due to the global financial crisis and the recession that followed. The delay of these projects was driven by the desire to take advantage of lower commodity costs, such as steel, the need to reevaluate the return on investment for a project or simply to better align the planned increased capacity with the revised timing of forecasted demand growth. Global demand forecasts were revised downward in the later part of 2008 and through the first half of 2009. Mid-year forecasts turned more positive with recovery being supported by economic investment in developing regions such as China, India and the Middle East. These regions, along with Latin America, Africa and other parts of Asia, continue to plan for investments to grow their operating capacity, driven by the intent to become self-sufficient or to move into the more profitable products derived from refined oil. The natural gas market experienced some reduction in spending on the upstream production side of the industry. This slowdown was influenced primarily by a drop in overall demand. Investments did continue in the liquefied natural gas expansion, as the need to prepare new gas field production for shipment to the consumer markets supported the need to complete the projects. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies. We believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations. A projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending, which could decrease demand for our products and services. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply, projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth. Chemical The chemical industry represented approximately 18% and 17% of our bookings in 2009 and 2008, respectively. This industry experienced adverse effects from the global financial crisis and recession, as consumer spending fell significantly and the GDP of many countries experienced declines for the first time in several years. Many of the major chemical companies were faced with restructuring their operations to align with current market conditions. In 2009, the industry experienced the closure or shut in of a large number of facilities around the globe, particularly in the mature markets. In developing regions, investments continued at a moderated pace compared to previous years. New plant investments are forecasted for developing regions as they build out capacity to meet their indigenous demand growth. Companies in the industry have generally increased their forecasts for maintenance and upgrades of continuing operations to ensure global competitiveness. The outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As consumer spending and industrial manufacturing gain momentum, the chemical industry should recover as well. A stabilizing of the price of oil feedstock has the opportunity to promote investment, as companies can more effectively project potential financial return. We believe the chemical industry in the near-term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry. 32 Table of Contents Power Generation The power generation industry represented approximately 20% and 15% of our bookings in 2009 and 2008, respectively. This industry continued to see capital investment growth due to the increased demands for electricity in developing countries, such as China and India, and capacity increases in mature markets, including the United States ( U.S. ). Due to the need for increased power generating capacity and concerns about the environment, this industry did see a significant increase in the area of renewable power. Plans for nuclear power generation expanded measurably through the year, with countries such as China and India raising their planned capacity over the next decade. Expansion in solar power created opportunities in concentrated solar power applications where our products proved their ability to tolerate high temperatures and abrasive flow mediums. The drive for a cleaner environment also increased investments in the development of carbon capture and storage methodologies where our products and services are applicable. We believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable; however, a protracted economic recovery period could delay the demand for additional power, which may affect the timing of major capital project spending. Current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. It is important to note that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the renewables market and carbon capture methodologies along with our global service and support structure position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry. Water Management The water management industry represented approximately 7% and 6% of our bookings in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continuing investments even in the current economic environment. Industry forecasts do indicate some potential funding challenges for municipal and government projects due to reduced tax revenues; however, several government stimulus programs are targeted at the maintenance and development of fresh water resources. These stimulus projects should generate demand and provide opportunities for pumps, valves, seals and actuation products. The water management industry is facing a future supply/demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization. Due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe, there continues to be an increased investment in desalination. This investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next couple of decades. We believe we are a global leader in the desalination market, which is already an important source of fresh water in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. We expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe, which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps, valves, actuation products and energy recovery devices. General Industries General industries comprises a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2009 and 2008. General industries also include sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 19% and 23% of our bookings in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, we saw a general decline in all of these businesses. Pulp and paper along with mining and ore processing are two areas that experienced measured declines in business activity and investment due to a drop in demand for their products. This drop in demand was directly related to the significant decrease in the rate of general 33 Table of Contents global economic growth. Other industries in this segment also experienced tougher market conditions when compared to previous years. The outlook for this group of industries is dependent upon the rate of economic recovery. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide business opportunities in these industries today and as the global economy recovers. The reporting of trends by product type, customer type and business type is based upon analytical review of individual operational results and knowledge of their respective businesses, as we do not formally track revenues by any of these categories. These trends are analyzed as a secondary reporting mechanism that is not derived directly from our general ledger system. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ( Item 8 ) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 ( Annual Report ), FPD acquired Calder AG, a Swiss supplier of energy recovery technology, effective April 21, 2009, and Calder AG results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition. Additionally, FPD acquired the remaining 50% interest in Niigata Worthington Company, Ltd. ( Niigata ), a Japanese manufacturer of pumps and other rotating equipment, effective March 1, 2008. The incremental interest acquired was accounted for as a step acquisition and Niigata results of operations have been consolidated since the date of acquisition. Prior to this transaction, our 50% interest in Niigata was recorded using the equity method of accounting. No pro forma information has been provided for either acquisition due to immateriality. As discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, in February 2009, we announced our intent to incur up to $40 million in realignment costs (the Initial Realignment Program ) to reduce and optimize certain non-strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure by improving our operating efficiency, reducing redundancies, maximizing global consistency and driving improved financial performance. The Initial Realignment Program was substantially complete at December 31, 2009. In October 2009, we announced our intent to incur additional realignment costs (the Subsequent Realignment Program ) to expand our efforts to optimize assets, reduce our overall cost structure, respond to reduced orders and drive an enhanced customer-facing organization. The Initial Realignment Program and the Subsequent Realignment Program are collectively referred to as our Realignment Programs. In January 2010, we announced our expectation that up to $20 million in charges related to our Realignment Programs would be incurred in 2010, which, when combined with the $68.1 million of charges incurred in 2009 (as disclosed in the table below), brings our total expected realignment charges to approximately $88 million. Unless otherwise stated, information about our Realignment Programs included in this MD&A is presented in total. For the individual impacts of each program, please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Realignment Programs consist of both restructuring and non-restructuring costs. Restructuring charges represent costs associated with the relocation of certain business activities, outsourcing of some business activities and facility closures. Non-restructuring charges are costs incurred to improve operating efficiency and reduce redundancies, which includes a reduction in headcount. Expenses are reported in Cost of Sales ( COS ) or Selling, General and Administrative Expense ( SG&A ), as applicable, in our consolidated statement of income. 34 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our charges included in operating income in 2009 related to our Realignment Programs: Subtotal Flowserve Flow Flow Reportable Consolidated Total Charges for 2009 Pump Control Solutions Segments All Other Total (Amounts in millions) Restructuring Charges COS $ 14.3 $ 0.5 $ 4.9 $ 19.7 $ 0.7 $ 20.4 SG&A 3.3 0.2 6.9 10.4 1.4 11.8 $ 17.6 $ 0.7 $ 11.8 $ 30.1 $ 2.1 $ 32.2 Non-restructuring Charges COS $ 9.4 $ 7.0 $ 4.6 $ 21.0 $ 0.1 $ 21.1 SG&A 6.0 3.8 4.2 14.0 0.8 14.8 $ 15.4 $ 10.8 $ 8.8 $ 35.0 $ 0.9 $ 35.9 Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 23.7 $ 7.5 $ 9.5 $ 40.7 $ 0.8 $ 41.5 SG&A 9.3 4.0 11.1 24.4 2.2 26.6 $ 33.0 $ 11.5 $ 20.6 $ 65.1 $ 3.0 $ 68.1 The following is a summary of charges related to identified initiatives under our Realignment Programs expected to be incurred in 2010: Subtotal Flowserve Flow Flow Reportable Consolidated Total Expected Charges for 2010(1) Pump Control Solutions Segments All Other Total (Amounts in millions) Restructuring Charges COS $ 3.8 $ $ 0.9 $ 4.7 $ $ 4.7 SG&A 0.2 0.2 0.2 $ 4.0 $ $ 0.9 $ 4.9 $ $ 4.9 Non-restructuring Charges COS $ 0.9 $ 1.9 $ 0.1 $ 2.9 $ $ 2.9 SG&A $ 0.9 $ 1.9 $ 0.1 $ 2.9 $ $ 2.9 Total Realignment Program Charges COS $ 4.7 $ 1.9 $ 1.0 $ 7.6 $ $ 7.6 SG&A 0.2 0.2 0.2 $ 4.9 $ 1.9 $ 1.0 $ 7.8 $ $ 7.8 (1) As the execution of the Subsequent Realignment Program is in the early stages, actual charges incurred could vary from total charges expected to be incurred, which represent management best estimate based on initiatives identified to date. The amounts disclosed above do not include up to $12 million anticipated to be incurred for initiatives that are currently under consideration, the actual amount of which could differ materially from this estimate. Based on actions under our Initial Realignment Program, we have realized savings of approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Upon completion of our Initial Realignment Program, we expect annual cost savings of approximately $70 million. Approximately two-thirds of savings were and will be realized in COS, with the remainder in SG&A. 35 Table of Contents Upon completion of currently identified initiatives under our Subsequent Realignment Program, we expect additional annual cost savings of approximately $40 million. Approximately half of savings are expected to be realized in COS, with the remainder in SG&A. As the execution of the Subsequent Realignment Program is in the early stages, actual savings realized could vary from expected savings, which represent management best estimate to date. Generally, the charges presented were or will be paid in cash, except for asset write-downs, which are non-cash charges. Asset write-down charges (including accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, accelerated amortization of intangible assets and inventory write-downs) of $6.4 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately $10 million of cash payments related to our Initial Realignment Program and most of the cash payments related to our Subsequent Realignment Program will be incurred in 2010. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Outlook for 2010 section included in this MD&A. Bookings and Backlog 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 3,885.3 $ 5,105.7 $ 4,318.7 Backlog (at period end) 2,371.2 2,825.1 2,276.6 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer with regard to manufacture, service or support. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the year-to-date period are excluded from year-to-date bookings. Bookings in 2009 decreased by $1,220.4 million, or 23.9%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $216 million. These decreases are primarily attributable to declines in the oil and gas and general industries and reflect lower demand and customer-driven project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth as compared with 2008. The decrease consists of declines in original equipment bookings in FPD, including the impacts of $110.9 million of thruster orders and the impact of the $85 million Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline order that were recorded in the same period in 2008 and did not recur, as well as declines in original equipment bookings by FSD. The decrease is also attributable to declines in the chemical industry and orders from distributors in FCD, partially offset by orders of more than $45 million in FCD to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units in North America. Bookings in 2008 increased by $787.0 million, or 18.2%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $181 million. The increase was attributable to strength in the oil and gas and general industries, especially in FPD, primarily in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMA ), as well as continued strength in the chemical industry, especially in FCD, and the power generation industry in FPD and FCD and $68.5 million in bookings provided by Niigata. Historically, the fourth quarter has been a strong bookings quarter for us. However, bookings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were lower than bookings in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2008, reflecting our customers responses to concerns regarding recent disruptions in the credit and capital markets, global economic conditions and recent declines in oil and gas prices. Backlog represents the accumulation of uncompleted customer orders. Backlog of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2009 decreased by $453.9 million, or 16.1%, as compared to December 31, 2008. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $87 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). The overall net decrease includes the impact of cancellations of $41.2 million. By the end of 2010, we expect to ship over 90% of our December 31, 2009 backlog. Backlog of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2008 increased by $548.5 million, or 24.1%, as compared to December 31, 2007. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $185 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we had cancellations of $32.2 million, approximately $25 million of which was related to a single booking recorded by FPD in the third quarter of 2008. Sales 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 4,365.3 $ 4,473.5 $ 3,762.7 36 Table of Contents Sales in 2009 decreased by $108.2 million, or 2.4%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $208 million. The overall net decrease is attributable to decreased chemical and general industries sales and sales to distributors in FCD and decreased original equipment and aftermarket sales by FSD. These decreases were mostly offset by increased sales in FPD, primarily in the oil and gas and general industries, driven by shipments of large original equipment project orders that were booked in 2008. In 2009, original equipment sales decreased approximately 4% as compared with 2008 and aftermarket sales were comparable to 2008. Sales in 2008 increased by $710.8 million, or 18.9%, as compared with 2007. The increase includes currency benefits of approximately $113 million. The increase was attributable to strength in the oil and gas and power generation markets in FPD, primarily in EMA and Asia Pacific, and growth in all markets in FCD, primarily in EMA and Asia Pacific, as well as $87.0 million in sales provided by Niigata. In 2008, original equipment and aftermarket sales increased approximately 22% and 13%, respectively, as compared with 2007. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 73% of sales in 2009 compared with 69% of sales in 2008 and 66% of sales in 2007. Sales to EMA were approximately 40%, 39% and 38% of total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales into the Asia Pacific region were approximately 20%, 18%, and 16% of total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales to Latin America were approximately 9%, 8% and 7% of total sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Gross profit $ 1,548.1 $ 1,580.3 $ 1,247.7 Gross profit margin 35.5 % 35.3 % 33.2 % Gross profit in 2009 decreased by $32.2 million, or 2.0%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes the effect of $41.5 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 35.5% was comparable with 2008. Improved pricing on original equipment orders that were booked by FPD and FCD in 2008 and shipped in 2009, increased utilization of low cost regions by FCD and FSD, various CIP initiatives and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program were offset by a sales mix shift toward lower margin original equipment in FPD. Original equipment generally carries a lower margin than aftermarket. The sale of specialty pumps, which carry a higher margin, contributed to higher gross profit margins in both 2009 and 2008. Gross profit in 2008 increased by $332.6 million, or 26.7%, as compared with 2007. Gross profit margin in 2008 of 35.3% increased from 33.2% in 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to FPD, whose gross profit margin increased due primarily to improved original equipment pricing implemented in 2007, increased throughput and increased sales, which favorably impacted our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, and reduced warranty costs as a percentage of sales, as well as the impact of CIP initiatives. Additionally, gross profit margin was favorably impacted by specialty pumps, which had a higher margin. Partially offsetting these improvements was the significant growth in original equipment sales. While both original equipment and aftermarket sales increased, original equipment sales growth exceeded that of aftermarket sales growth during 2008. As a result, original equipment sales increased to approximately 65% of total sales as compared with approximately 63% in 2007. Original equipment generally carries a lower margin than aftermarket. Selling, General and Administrative Expense ( SG&A ) 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) SG&A $ 934.5 $ 981.6 $ 854.5 SG&A as a percentage of sales 21.4 % 21.9 % 22.7 % SG&A is impacted by growth in our underlying business, various initiatives to improve organizational capability, compliance and systems and infrastructure improvements. SG&A in 2009 decreased by $47.1 million, or 4.8%, as compared with 2008. SG&A includes the effect of $26.6 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $32 million. The decrease was primarily 37 Table of Contents attributable to a $42.6 million decrease in selling and marketing-related expenses, which is consistent with decreased bookings and sales. Cash recoveries of bad debts of $5.0 million that were reserved in 2008, a $4.4 million benefit from the adjustment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Calder AG (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report), strict cost control actions and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program were partially offset by an increase in legal fees and accrued resolution costs related to shareholder litigation (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and charges resulting from our Realignment Programs. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2009 improved 50 basis points as compared with 2008, primarily as a result of decreased selling and marketing-related expenses. SG&A in 2008 increased by $127.1 million, or 14.9%, as compared with 2007. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $21 million. The increase in SG&A was primarily attributable to a $61.5 million increase in selling and marketing-related expenses in support of increased bookings and sales and overall business growth. The increase was also attributable to a $47.0 million increase in other employees costs due to annual and long-term incentive compensation plans, including equity compensation, arising from improved performance and a higher stock price as of the date of grant and annual merit increases, $9.8 million of SG&A incurred by Niigata and a $11.1 million increase in bad debt expense, primarily in FCD, partially offset by a $10.3 million decrease in legal fees and expenses due to legal matters incurred in 2007 that did not recur. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2008 improved 80 basis points as compared with the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of leverage from increased sales. Net Earnings from Affiliates 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 15.8 $ 17.0 $ 18.7 Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in seven joint ventures (one located in each of China, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and two located in India) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates in 2009 decreased by $1.2 million as compared with 2008, primarily attributable to our FCD joint venture in India and the impact of the consolidation of Niigata in the first quarter of 2008 when we purchased the remaining 50% interest. Net earnings from affiliates in 2008 decreased by $1.7 million as compared with 2007, primarily attributable to the impact of the consolidation of Niigata in the first quarter of 2008 when we purchased the remaining 50% interest. Operating Income 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Operating income $ 629.5 $ 615.7 $ 411.9 Operating income as a percentage of sales 14.4 % 13.8 % 10.9 % Operating income in 2009 increased by $13.8 million, or 2.2%, as compared with 2008. The increase includes the effect of approximately $68.1 million in charges from our Realignment Programs in 2009, mostly offset by savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program. The increase includes negative currency effects of approximately $48 million. The overall net increase was primarily a result of the $47.1 million decrease in SG&A, partially offset by the $32.2 million decrease in gross profit, discussed above. Operating income in 2008 increased by $203.8 million, or 49.5%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $20 million. The increase was primarily a result of the $332.6 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $127.1 million increase in SG&A, discussed above. 38 Table of Contents Interest Expense and Interest Income 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (40.0 ) $ (51.3 ) $ (60.1 ) Interest income 3.2 8.4 4.3 Interest expense decreased by $11.3 million in 2009 as compared with 2008, primarily as a result of decreased interest rates. Interest expense in 2008 decreased by $8.8 million as compared with 2007, primarily as a result of lower average outstanding debt and decreased interest rates. At December 31, 2009 approximately 71% of our debt was at fixed rates, including the effects of $385.0 million of notional interest rate swaps. Interest income in 2009 decreased by $5.2 million as compared with 2008 due to decreased interest rates. Interest income in 2008 increased by $4.1 million as compared with 2007 due primarily to a higher average cash balance. Other (Expense) Income, net 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Other (expense) income, net $ (8.0 ) $ 20.2 $ 5.9 Other (expense) income, net in 2009 decreased to net other expense of $8.0 million, as compared with net other income of $20.2 million in 2008, primarily due to a $13.5 million increase in net losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies, an $11.0 million decrease in net gains on forward exchange contracts (primarily the Euro and British Pound) and $2.8 million gain in 2008 on the bargain purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Niigata, as discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, that did not recur. Other (expense) income, net in 2008 increased by $14.3 million to net other income of $20.2 million as compared with 2007. This increase was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in net gains on forward exchange contracts and a $1.1 million increase in net gains on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the $2.8 million gain on the bargain purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Niigata, as discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as well as other individually immaterial items. Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 156.5 $ 147.7 $ 104.3 Effective tax rate 26.8 % 24.9 % 28.8 % The 2009 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which includes the impacts of lower foreign tax rates and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions. The 2008 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which includes the impacts of lower foreign tax rates, changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions, benefits arising from our permanent reinvestment in foreign subsidiaries, changes in valuation allowance estimates and a favorable tax ruling in Luxembourg. The net impact of discrete items included in the discussion above was approximately $22 million, which lowered the effective tax rate by approximately 3.7%. The 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations and changes in valuation allowance estimates, as well as changes in tax law and net favorable results from various tax audits, partially offset by additional reserves established for uncertain tax positions pursuant to our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 740, Income Taxes. See additional 39 Table of Contents discussion of uncertain tax positions in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We have operations in Asian countries that provide various tax incentives. During 2004, we received a 5-year, 10% tax rate in Singapore for income in excess of a prescribed base amount generated from certain regional headquarter activities, subject to certain employment and investment requirements. In 2008, the 10% tax rate in Singapore was extended through 2011. In India, we were granted 100% tax exemptions for profits derived from export sales and certain manufacturing operations in prescribed areas for a period of 10 years. The exemption for profits derived from export sales will expire in 2011, and the manufacturing operations exemption expired in 2007. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law, creating an exclusion from U.S. taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties that, prior to 2006, have been subject to U.S. taxation. This exclusion was effective for the years 2006 through 2009, and applied to certain of our related party payments. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2009 we have foreign tax credits of $9.8 million, expiring in 2018 through 2019 against which we recorded $0.4 million in valuation allowances. Additionally, we have recorded other U.S. net deferred tax assets of $97.7 million, which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would be negatively impacted. Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings of Flowserve Corporation $ 427.9 $ 442.4 $ 255.8 Net earnings per share diluted 7.59 7.71 4.44 Average diluted shares 56.4 57.4 57.6 Net earnings in 2009 decreased by $14.5 million to $427.9 million, or $7.59 per diluted share, as compared with 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $28.2 million increase in other expense and an $8.8 million increase in tax expense, partially offset by the $13.8 million increase in operating income and an $11.3 million decrease in interest expense, as discussed above. Net earnings in 2008 increased by $186.6 million to $442.4 million, or $7.71 per diluted share, as compared with 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to the $203.8 million increase in operating income, partially offset by the $43.4 million increase in tax expense, as discussed above. Other Comprehensive Income (Expense) 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive income (expense) $ 63.0 $ (190.8 ) $ 70.4 Other comprehensive income (expense) in 2009 increased by $253.8 million to income of $63.0 million as compared with 2008. The increase was due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro at December 31, 2009 as compared with December 31, 2008, as well as a decrease in pension and other postretirement expense, due primarily to events in 2008 that did not recur. and an increase in results from interest rate hedging activity. Other comprehensive (expense) income in 2008 decreased by $261.2 million to expense of $190.8 million as compared with 2007. This was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro and the British Pound at December 31, 2008 as compared with December 31, 2007, as well as a decrease in pension 40 Table of Contents and other postretirement income, which primarily reflects actuarial net losses resulting from returns on plan assets that were lower than anticipated. Business Segments Through December 31, 2009, we conducted our business through three business segments that represent our major product areas. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, FPD, FCD and FSD, are discussed below. Flowserve Pump Division Segment Results Through FPD, we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered and industrial pumps and pump systems and submersible motors (collectively referred to as original equipment ). FPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment, and provides a full array of support services (collectively referred to as aftermarket ). FPD has 30 manufacturing facilities worldwide, 13 of which are located in Europe, seven in North America, six in Asia and four in Latin America. FPD also has 78 service centers, including those co-located in a manufacturing facility, in 30 countries. We operate primarily in the oil and gas, chemical and power generation industries. Flowserve Pump Division 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 2,207.6 $ 3,040.3 $ 2,551.4 Sales 2,649.6 2,514.8 2,095.4 Gross profit 840.6 786.0 596.6 Gross profit margin 31.7 % 31.3 % 28.5 % Segment operating income 441.6 391.6 274.8 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 16.7 % 15.6 % 13.1 % Backlog (at period end) 1,823.5 2,253.1 1,775.3 Bookings in 2009 decreased by $832.7 million, or 27.4%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $142 million. The decrease in bookings reflects lower demand and customer-driven large project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth as compared with 2008. The decrease consists of declines in original equipment bookings on major projects, which was driven by declines in the oil and gas, general, water management and chemical industries, and includes the impacts of $110.9 million in thruster orders and the $85 million order to supply a variety of pumps to build the Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline, which were booked in 2008 and did not recur. Bookings in EMA, North America and Latin America decreased $516.4 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $89 million), $283.0 million and $122.4 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $35 million), respectively. Of the $2.2 billion of bookings in 2009, approximately 43% were from oil and gas, 23% from power generation, 10% from water management, 8% from chemical and 16% from general industries. Bookings in 2008 increased by $488.9 million, or 19.2%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $115 million. The increase was attributable to EMA, North America and Asia Pacific, which increased $251.1 million (including currency benefits of approximately $106 million), $109.3 million and $109.2 million (including currency benefits of approximately $14 million), respectively. Bookings for original equipment and aftermarket increased approximately 20% and 16%, respectively. Original equipment bookings were driven by the oil and gas, power generation, water management and general industries. Niigata provided an increase of $68.5 million to total bookings and represented approximately 14% of the total bookings increase. The bookings increase also includes an order of approximately $85 million to supply a variety of pumps to build the Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline. These pumps will largely be supplied from our European operations and are scheduled to ship in 2010. Of the $3.0 billion in total bookings in 2008, approximately 49% were from oil and gas, 16% from power generation, 9% from water management, 8% from chemical and 18% from general industries. 41 Table of Contents Sales in 2009 increased by $134.8 million, or 5.4%, as compared with 2008. The increase includes negative currency effects of approximately $127 million. The increase was driven by shipments of original equipment large project orders that were booked in 2008 when the oil and gas and power generation industries were stronger and prices were more favorable, which contributed to the increase of approximately 10% in original equipment sales in 2009 as compared with 2008. EMA, Asia Pacific and Latin America increased $119.0 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $87 million), $39.5 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $4 million) and $23.0 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $33 million), respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in North America of $40.8 million, which was attributable to a decline in aftermarket sales, primarily in the chemical and general industries. Sales in 2008 increased by $419.4 million, or 20.0%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $67 million. The increase is primarily attributable to EMA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, which increased $212.9 million (including currency benefits of approximately $51 million), $91.9 million (including currency benefits of approximately $15 million) and $28.6 million (currency had a negligible impact), respectively. Original equipment sales increased by approximately 22%, while aftermarket sales grew by approximately 17% compared to 2007. As noted above, the strong growth in our served markets over the past two years, predominantly oil and gas and power generation, have been the key drivers of the increases in sales in 2008. The increase in sales was also attributable to increased throughput resulting from capacity expansion, price increases initiated in 2007 and sales of $87.0 million provided by Niigata. Gross profit in 2009 increased by $54.6 million, or 6.9%, as compared with 2008. The increase includes the effect of $23.7 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 31.7% increased from 31.3% in 2008. Increases provided by improved pricing on original equipment orders shipped in 2009 that were booked in late 2007 and early 2008, supply chain initiatives, operating efficiency improvements and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program were partially offset by a sales mix shift toward original equipment. Original equipment generally carries a lower margin than aftermarket. As a result of the sales mix shift, original equipment sales increased to approximately 64% of total sales, as compared with approximately 61% of total sales in 2008. Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by an increase in sales in 2009 of specialty pumps, which have a higher margin, as compared with 2008. Gross profit in 2008 increased by $189.4 million, or 31.7%, as compared with 2007 and includes gross profit attributable to Niigata of $20.9 million. Gross profit margin in 2008 of 31.3% increased from 28.5% in 2007. This increase was primarily due to improved original equipment pricing implemented in 2007, increased throughput and increased sales, which favorably impact our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, and reduced warranty costs as a percentage of sales, as well as the impact of CIP initiatives. Additionally, gross profit margin was favorably impacted by specialty pumps, which had a higher margin. Partially offsetting these improvements was the significant growth in original equipment sales. While both original equipment and aftermarket sales increased, original equipment growth exceeded that of aftermarket growth during 2008. As a result, original equipment sales increased to approximately 61% of total sales as compared with approximately 60% of total sales in 2007. Original equipment generally carries a lower margin than aftermarket. Operating income in 2009 increased by $50.0 million, or 12.8%, as compared with 2008. Operating income includes the effect of $33.0 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. The increase includes negative currency effects of approximately $31 million. The increase was due primarily to increased gross profit of $54.6 million, which includes the effect of savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program, as discussed above, partially offset by an increase in SG&A. The increase in SG&A is attributable to charges resulting from our Realignment Programs, partially offset by strict cost control actions, a $4.4 million benefit from the adjustment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Calder AG (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report) and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program. Operating income in 2008 increased by $116.8 million, or 42.5%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $11 million. The increase was due primarily to increased gross profit of $189.4 million, partially offset by a $69.5 million increase in SG&A (including negative currency effects of approximately $10 million) primarily related to a $24.9 million increase in selling and marketing-related expense in 42 Table of Contents support of increased bookings and sales and overall business growth. The increase was also attributable to an $18.9 million increase in other employees costs due to annual and long-term incentive compensation plans, including equity compensation, arising from improved performance and a higher stock price as of the date of grant and annual merit increases and $9.8 million of SG&A incurred by Niigata. Operating margin improved 250 basis points as compared with 2007 due primarily to the increase in gross profit margin of 280 basis points. Backlog of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2009 decreased by $429.6 million, or 19.1%, as compared to December 31, 2008. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $74 million. The overall net decrease includes the impact of cancellations of $39.0 million of orders booked during the prior year. The acquisition of Calder AG resulted in a $6.2 million increase in backlog. Backlog of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2008 increased by $477.8 million, or 26.9%, as compared to December 31, 2007. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $149 million. Flow Control Division Segment Results Our second largest business segment is FCD, which designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered-to-order and configure-to-order isolation valves, control valves, valve automation products, boiler controls and related services. FCD leverages its experience and application know-how by offering a complete menu of engineered services to complement its expansive product portfolio. FCD has a total of 47 manufacturing facilities and QRCs in 22 countries around the world, with only five of its 19 manufacturing operations located in the U.S. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that we are the third largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis. Flow Control Division 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 1,198.3 $ 1,486.4 $ 1,245.7 Sales 1,203.2 1,381.7 1,163.2 Gross profit 445.2 497.7 405.8 Gross profit margin 37.0 % 36.0 % 34.9 % Segment operating income 204.1 218.7 163.8 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 17.0 % 15.8 % 14.1 % Backlog (at period end) 485.3 482.9 414.8 Bookings in 2009 decreased by $288.1 million, or 19.4%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $53 million. The decrease in bookings is primarily attributable to Europe and North America, which decreased approximately $135 million and $70 million, respectively, driven by an overall decrease in orders from distributors and the chemical industry, as well as customer-driven delays in large projects in the oil and gas market. The decline in orders from distributors in Europe was driven by a decrease in general industries due to uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions. The decline in orders from distributors in North America was due to inventory destocking, but has recently exhibited evidence of stabilization. The chemical industry represents the largest global market decline, especially in Europe and North America, while oil and gas bookings declined due to customer-driven large project delays. Bookings in Asia Pacific decreased approximately $40 million, attributable to customer-driven delays on large projects in the chemical industry, and bookings in Latin America decreased approximately $26 million due to large pulp and paper projects in the first quarter of 2008 that did not recur. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in nuclear power orders, which included orders recorded in the third quarter of 2009 of more than $45 million to supply valves to four Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear power units in North America, new project bookings in the emerging solar market, reflecting future growth opportunities, growth in the Middle East through expansion of QRC and joint venture activities and increased aftermarket repair and replacement orders. Of the $1.2 billion of bookings in 2009, approximately 29% were from chemical, 28% from general industries, 23% from power generation and 20% from oil and gas. Bookings in 2008 increased by $240.7 million, or 19.3%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $51 million. The growth in bookings was primarily attributable to strength in 43 Table of Contents Europe and Asia Pacific, which increased approximately $79 million and $89 million, respectively. These regions continued to be a focus for growth opportunities. North America and Latin America combined increased approximately $54 million. Key growth areas included chemicals and nuclear power generation. Of the $1.5 billion of bookings in 2008, approximately 34% were from chemical, 31% from general industries, 18% from oil and gas and 17% from power generation. Sales in 2009 decreased by $178.5 million, or 12.9%, as compared with 2008. This decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $56 million. Sales in Europe and North America decreased approximately $91 million and $56 million, respectively, driven by an overall decline in sales to distributors and the chemical industry, as well as customer-driven delays in large projects in the oil and gas industry. Due to the short lead-time for our products, the drivers of the decline in sales are consistent with the drivers of the decline in bookings discussed above. Sales in 2008 increased by $218.5 million, or 18.8%, as compared with 2007. This increase included currency benefits of approximately $34 million. Asia Pacific, which increased approximately $64 million, continued to show substantial sales growth in the chemical market, especially in China. Sales across our markets in Europe demonstrated growth of approximately $48 million. North American sales also produced growth of approximately $42 million. Oil and gas market sales reflected steady increases in all regions, especially in Europe and the Middle East. Latin America sales increased approximately $34 million, which was due primarily to growth in the pulp and paper market, which was not expected to continue in the near term. Gross profit in 2009 decreased by $52.5 million, or 10.5%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes the effect of $7.5 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 37.0% increased from 36.0% for 2008. The increase in gross profit margin is attributable to improved pricing on large projects booked in 2008 that shipped in 2009, increased aftermarket repair and replacement business, materials cost savings, various CIP initiatives, improved utilization of low cost regions, volume-related cost control actions and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program. These improvements were partially offset by pricing pressure and the negative impact of decreased sales on absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Gross profit in 2008 increased by $91.9 million, or 22.6%, as compared with 2007. Gross profit margin in 2008 of 36.0% increased from 34.9% in 2007. The increase reflected higher sales levels, which favorably impacted our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Price increases, CIP, materials saving initiatives, investment in new products and increased absorption continued to drive margin improvement and offset the inflationary impact of our raw materials. The impact of metal price increases and transportation fuel surcharges were minimized through supply chain initiatives. Operating income in 2009 decreased by $14.6 million, or 6.7% as compared with 2008. The decrease includes the effect of $11.5 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. The decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $10 million. The decrease is attributable to the $52.5 million decrease in gross profit, which includes the effect of savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program, partially offset by a $41.2 million decrease in SG&A. Reduced SG&A was attributable to decreased selling and marketing-related expenses, strict cost control actions, $5.0 million in cash recoveries of bad debts reserved in 2008 and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program in 2009. Operating income in 2008 increased by $54.9 million, or 33.5%, as compared with 2007. This increase included currency benefits of approximately $6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the $91.9 million improvement in gross profit, offset in part by higher SG&A, which increased $38.3 million (including negative currency effects of approximately $7 million). Increased SG&A is primarily due to $17.3 million in higher selling and marketing costs and $4.9 million in increased R&D costs, as well as a $7.3 million bad debt expense related to two customers. Partially offsetting these cost increases was the reversal of a net $2.3 million accrual due to a contract settlement and a $1.2 million increase in net earnings from affiliates generated by our joint venture in India, which was driven by growth in the oil and gas markets in the Middle East. SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points, primarily attributable to leverage from increased sales. Backlog of $485.3 million at December 31, 2009 was comparable to December 31, 2008. Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $9 million. Backlog of $482.9 million at December 31, 2008 increased by 44 Table of Contents $68.1 million, or 16.4%, as compared to December 31, 2007. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $21 million. Flow Solutions Division Segment Results Through FSD, we engineer, manufacture and sell mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and parts, and provide related services, principally to process industries and general industrial markets, with similar products sold internally in support of FPD. FSD has added to its global operations and has ten manufacturing operations, four of which are located in the U.S. FSD operates 80 QRCs worldwide (including six that are co-located in a manufacturing facility), including 24 sites in North America, 20 in EMA, 19 in Latin America and 17 in Asia. Our ability to rapidly deliver mechanical sealing technology through global engineering tools, locally sited QRCs and on-site engineers represents a significant competitive advantage. This business model has enabled FSD to establish a large number of alliances with multi-national customers. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that we are the second largest mechanical seal supplier in the world. Flow Solutions Division 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 553.9 $ 668.8 $ 592.5 Sales 579.2 653.7 564.5 Gross profit 264.8 299.1 252.6 Gross profit margin 45.7 % 45.8 % 44.7 % Segment operating income 102.7 129.2 112.7 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 17.7 % 19.8 % 20.0 % Backlog (at period end) 96.4 118.2 109.4 Bookings in 2009 decreased by $114.9 million, or 17.2%, as compared with 2008. This decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $21 million. The decrease in bookings reflects lower demand and customer-driven project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth as compared with 2008. A $106.0 million decrease in customer bookings was due primarily to decreases in both project and aftermarket bookings. An $8.9 million decrease in interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) also contributed to the decrease. The decrease in customer bookings of original equipment and aftermarket was primarily attributable to North America, driven by the oil and gas, chemical and general industries, as well as decreases in the oil and gas and general industries across all other regions. Of the $489.3 million of customer bookings in 2009, approximately 42% were from oil and gas, 31% from chemical and 27% from general industries. Bookings in 2008 increased by $76.3 million, or 12.9%, as compared with 2007. This increase included currency benefits of approximately $15 million. A $65.4 million increase in customer bookings was due primarily to increased original equipment bookings in EMA, North America and Latin America, as well as increased aftermarket bookings in Latin America, North America and Asia Pacific. A $10.9 million increase in interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) also contributed to the increase. Of the $595.8 million of customer bookings in 2008, approximately 45% were from oil and gas, 24% from chemical and 31% from general industries. Sales in 2009 decreased by $74.5 million, or 11.4%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $24 million. The decrease in sales reflects lower demand and project delays due to a significant decrease in the rate of general global economic growth as compared with 2008. The decrease was driven by declines in customer sales of both original equipment and aftermarket in all regions, as well as a $12.0 million decrease in interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above). The decrease in customer sales of original equipment and aftermarket was primarily attributable to North America, driven by the oil and gas, chemical and general industries, as well as decreases in the oil and gas and general industries across all other regions. 45 Table of Contents Sales in 2008 increased by $89.2 million, or 15.8%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $12 million. A $74.0 million increase in customer sales was primarily attributable to increased original equipment sales in EMA, North America and Latin America, as well as to increased aftermarket sales in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific. A $15.2 million increase in interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) also contributed to the increase. Gross profit in 2009 decreased by $34.3 million, or 11.5%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes the effect of $9.5 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs in 2009. Gross profit margin in 2009 of 45.7% was comparable with 2008. A sales mix shift toward more profitable aftermarket sales and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program, strict cost control actions and increased utilization of low cost regions were offset by the impact of decreased sales, which negatively impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Gross profit in 2008 increased by $46.5 million, or 18.4%, as compared with 2007. Gross profit margin in 2008 of 45.8% increased from 44.7% in 2007. The improvements reflected the increase in sales, which favorably impacted our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, as well as the impact of cost savings initiatives throughout the year. These improvements were partially offset by a sales mix shift to original equipment business in North America and EMA. Increases in materials costs were largely offset through supply chain management efforts and price increases in mid-2007 and early 2008. Operating income in 2009 decreased by $26.5 million, or 20.5%, as compared with 2008. The decrease includes the effect of $20.6 million in charges resulting from our Realignment Programs. The decrease includes negative currency effects of approximately $8 million. The decrease is due to the $34.3 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $7.3 million decrease in SG&A. The decrease in SG&A was due to strict cost control actions in 2009 and savings realized from our Initial Realignment Program in 2009. Operating income in 2008 increased by $16.5 million, or 14.6%, as compared with 2007. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $3 million. The improvement in 2008 reflected the $46.5 million increase in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $29.8 million increase in SG&A (including negative currency effects of approximately $4 million) due primarily to a $15.5 million increase related to sales and engineering and related expenses and approximately $1 million of realignment costs, as well as to increased infrastructure costs to support the global growth of our business. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2008 increased 110 basis points as compared with 2007, resulting from investment in our global selling footprint and engineering support in anticipation of future sales. Backlog of $96.4 million at December 31, 2009 decreased by $21.8 million, or 18.4%, as compared to December 31, 2008. Currency provided an increase of approximately $4 million. Backlog at December 31, 2009 includes $22.8. million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $118.2 million at December 31, 2008 increased by $8.8 million, or 8.0%, as compared with 2007. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $5 million. Backlog at December 31, 2008 included $18.6 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Analysis 2009 2008 2007 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 431.3 $ 408.8 $ 417.7 Net cash flows used by investing activities (138.6 ) (119.6 ) (77.9 ) Net cash flows used by financing activities (107.1 ) (185.5 ) (50.1 ) Existing cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving line of credit are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2009 was $654.3 million, compared with $472.1 million at December 31, 2008 and $373.2 million at December 31, 2007. 46 Table of Contents Working capital increased in 2009 due primarily to lower accrued liabilities of $106.8 million resulting primarily from reductions in accruals for long-term and broad-based annual incentive program payments and reductions in advanced cash received from customers and lower accounts payable of $104.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by lower inventory of $74.7 million and lower accounts receivable of $50.7 million. During 2009, we contributed $83.1 million to our U.S. pension plan. Working capital increased in 2008 due primarily to higher inventory of $195.5 million, especially project-related inventory required to support future shipments of products in backlog, and higher accounts receivable of $195.1 million, resulting primarily from higher sales and a $63.9 million reduction in factored receivables resulting from the discontinuation of our factoring program in early 2008. During 2008, we contributed $50.8 million to our U.S. pension plan. Our goal for days sales receivables outstanding ( DSO ) is 60 days. For the fourth quarter of 2009, we achieved a DSO of 59 days as compared with 62 days for the same period in 2008. For reference purposes based on 2009 sales, a DSO improvement of one day could provide approximately $13 million in cash. Decreases in inventory provided $74.7 million of cash flow for 2009 compared with a use of cash of $195.5 million and $101.8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Inventory turns were 4.0 times at December 31, 2009, compared with 3.6 times at December 31, 2008 and 4.4 times at December 31, 2007. For reference purposes based on 2009 data, an improvement of one turn could yield approximately $160 million in cash. Cash outflows for investing activities were $138.6 million, $119.6 million and $77.9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, due primarily to capital expenditures. Cash outflows for 2009 also include $30.8 million for the acquisition of Calder AG, as discussed below in Acquisitions and Dispositions. Capital expenditures during 2009 were $108.4 million, a decrease of $18.5 million as compared with 2008. Our capital expenditures have been focused on capacity expansion, including expansion of our QRC network, nuclear capabilities and low-cost sourcing; enterprise resource planning application upgrades; information technology infrastructure; and cost reduction opportunities. Cash outflows for financing activities were $107.1 million in 2009 compared with $185.5 million in 2008 and $50.1 million in 2007. Cash outflows during 2009 resulted primarily from the payment of $59.2 million in dividends and $40.9 million for the repurchase of common shares. Cash outflows during 2008 resulted primarily from the repurchase of common shares for $165.0 million and the payment of $51.5 million of dividends. On February 23, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.25 per share to $0.27 per share payable quarterly beginning on April 8, 2009. On February 22, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.27 per share to $0.29 per share payable quarterly beginning on April 7, 2010. Generally, our dividend date-of-record is in the last month of the quarter, and the dividend is paid the following month. Any subsequent dividends will be reviewed by our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and declared at its discretion dependent on its assessment of our financial situation and business outlook at the applicable time. On February 26, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock, and the program commenced in the second quarter of 2008. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we reserve the right to limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time without notice. We repurchased 544,500 and 1,741,100 shares for $40.9 million and $165.0 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. To date, we have repurchased a total of 2,285,600 shares for $205.9 million under this program. Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to be slightly lower as compared with 2009, resulting from decreases in pension contributions and incentive compensation payments, partially offset by a small anticipated increase in capital expenditures and an increase in cash dividends. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by the decrease in the rate of general global economic growth, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our revolving credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months. 47 Table of Contents Payments for Acquisitions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. As discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, effective April 21, 2009, FPD acquired Calder AG, a private Swiss company and a supplier of energy recovery technology for use in the global desalination market, for up to $44.1 million, net of cash acquired. Of the total purchase price, $28.4 million was paid at closing and $2.4 million was paid after the working capital valuation was completed in early July 2009. During 2008, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in Niigata, effective March 1, 2008, for $2.4 million in cash. During 2007, we completed one small acquisition for $2.3 million. Financing Debt, including capital lease obligations, consisted of: December 31, 2009 2008 (Amounts in thousands) Term Loan, interest rate of 1.81% and 2.99% at December 31,2009 and 2008, respectively $ 544,016 $ 549,697 Capital lease obligations and other borrowings 22,712 23,651 Debt and capital lease obligations 566,728 573,348 Less amounts due within one year 27,355 27,731 Total debt due after one year $ 539,373 $ 545,617 Credit Facilities Our credit facilities, as amended, are comprised of a $600.0 million secured term loan maturing on August 10, 2012 and a $400.0 million revolving line of credit, which can be utilized to provide up to $300.0 million in letters of credit, expiring on August 10, 2012. We refer to these credit facilities collectively as our Credit Facilities. At both December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit. We had outstanding letters of credit of $123.1 million and $104.2 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which reduced our borrowing capacity to $276.9 million and $295.8 million, respectively. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the base rate (which is based on greater of the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under our Credit Facilities or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%) or (2) London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ), which as of December 31, 2009 was 0.875% and 1.50% for borrowings under our revolving line of credit and term loan, respectively. In connection with our Credit Facilities, we have entered into $385.0 million of notional amount interest rate swaps at December 31, 2009 to hedge exposure of floating interest rates. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our Credit Facilities. European Letter of Credit Facilities Our ability to issue additional letters of credit under our previous European Letter of Credit Facility ( Old European LOC Facility ), which had a commitment of 110.0 million, expired November 9, 2009. We paid annual and fronting fees of 0.875% and 0.10%, respectively, for letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility of 77.9 million ($111.5 million) and 104.0 million ($145.2 million) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. On October 30, 2009, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured European Letter of Credit Facility ( New European LOC Facility ) with an initial commitment of 125.0 million. The New European LOC Facility is 48 Table of Contents renewable annually and, consistent with the Old European LOC Facility, is used for contingent obligations in respect of surety and performance bonds, bank guarantees and similar obligations with maturities up to five years. We pay fees of 1.35% and 0.40% for utilized and unutilized capacity, respectively, under our New European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn on the New European LOC Facility of 2.8 million ($4.0 million) as of December 31, 2009. Certain banks are parties to both facilities and are managing their exposures on an aggregated basis. As such, the commitment under the New European LOC Facility is reduced by the face amount of existing letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility prior to its expiration. These existing letters of credit will remain outstanding, and accordingly offset the 125.0 million capacity of the New European LOC Facility until their maturity, which, as of December 31, 2009, was approximately two years for the majority of the outstanding existing letters of credit. After consideration of outstanding letters of credit under both facilities, the available capacity under the New European LOC Facility was 69.1 million as of December 31, 2009. Debt Prepayments and Repayments We made scheduled repayments under our Credit Facilities of $5.7 million, $5.7 million, and $2.8 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We made no mandatory repayments or optional prepayments in 2009, 2008 or 2007. We may prepay loans under our Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time. Debt Covenants and Other Matters Our Credit Facilities contain, among other things, covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries ability to dispose of assets, merge, pay dividends, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, incur indebtedness and guarantees, create liens, enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates, make capital expenditures, or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. Our Credit Facilities also contain covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders our audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements and leverage and interest coverage financial covenant certificates of compliance. The maximum permitted leverage ratio is 3.25 times total debt to consolidated EBITDA. The minimum interest coverage is 3.25 times consolidated EBITDA to total interest expense. Compliance with these financial covenants under our Credit Facilities is tested quarterly. Our Credit Facilities include events of default customary for these types of credit facilities, including nonpayment of principal or interest, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ( ERISA ), events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees or the security documents and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the acceleration of our and the guarantors obligations under the Credit Facilities. We complied with all covenants under our Credit Facilities through December 31, 2009. Our European letter of credit facilities contain covenants restricting the ability of certain foreign subsidiaries to issue debt, incur liens, sell assets, merge, consolidate, make certain investments, pay dividends, enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. The European letter of credit facilities also incorporate by reference the covenants contained in our Credit Facilities. Our European letter of credit facilities include events of default usual for these types of letter of credit facilities, including nonpayment of any fee or obligation, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the termination of the commitments and an acceleration of our obligations under the European letter of credit facilities. We complied with all covenants under our European letter of credit facilities through December 31, 2009. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity Analysis Our cash balance increased by $182.3 million to $654.3 million as of December 31, 2009 as compared with December 31, 2008. The increase in cash was due primarily to strong cash flow from operations, including working capital changes primarily related to collections of receivables, partially offset by significant cash uses, including approximately $115 million in long-term and broad-based annual incentive program payments related to prior period performance, $108.4 million in capital expenditures, $59.2 million in dividend payments, $83.1 million in contributions to our U.S. pension plan, $40.9 million of share repurchases and the funding of increased working capital requirements, as well as $30.8 million for the acquisition of Calder AG. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Approximately 1% of our term loan is due to mature in 2010 and approximately 25% in 2011. As noted above, our term loan and our revolving line of credit both mature in August 2012. After the effects of $385.0 million of notional interest rate swaps, approximately 71% of our term debt was at fixed rates at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had a borrowing capacity of $276.9 million on our $400.0 million revolving line of credit, and we had available capacity under the New European LOC Facility of 69.1 million. Our revolving line of credit and our European letter of credit facilities are committed and are held by a diversified group of financial institutions. We contributed $83.1 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2009 to maintain our pension funding at or above the fully-funded threshold prescribed by the ERISA, as amended. We experienced significant declines in the values of our U.S. pension plan assets in 2008 resulting primarily from declines in global equity markets. The decline is being recognized into earnings over the remaining service period. In 2009, we experienced increases in the values of our U.S. pension plan assets. After consideration of the impact of our contributions in 2009, the partial recovery in 2009 of asset value declines in 2008 and our intent to remain fully-funded, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2010 will be between $30 million and $40 million, excluding direct benefits paid. We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. Disruptions in financial markets and banking systems experienced in 2008 continue to create difficulties in accessing credit and capital markets, and the costs of newly raised debt have generally increased. Continuing disruptions in the functioning of credit and capital markets, a sluggish global economic recovery or extended slowing of global economic activity could potentially materially impair our and our customers ability to access these markets and increase associated costs, as well as our customers ability to pay in full and/or on a timely basis. There can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by these factors, and we continue to monitor and evaluate the implications of these factors on our current business, our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy. OUTLOOK FOR 2010 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin and costs, capital spending, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of investments, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Our bookings decreased 23.9% in 2009 as compared with 2008, and our backlog at December 31, 2009 decreased 16.1% as compared to December 31, 2008, which may drive reduced revenue in 2010 as compared with 2009, excluding currency fluctuations. Because a booking represents a contract that can be modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that the decrease in bookings will result in a comparable decrease in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. Historically, the fourth quarter has been a strong bookings quarter for us. Bookings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were slightly lower than bookings in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2009, reflecting 50 Table of Contents continued customer delays in booking large project orders and our management discipline surrounding pricing. Although we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities, we remain cautious in our outlook for 2010 given the booking levels in the fourth quarter of 2009 and backlog as of December 31, 2009 and the continuing uncertainty of global economic conditions. For additional discussion on our markets and our opportunities therein, see the Business Overview Our Markets section of this MD&A. We could experience increased external pressures on gross profit margin in 2010 as compared with 2009 and 2008 due to price competition associated with current global economic conditions. Additionally, a shift in our sales mix away from higher margin specialty pumps could negatively impact our margins in 2010 as compared with 2009 and 2008. We expect these gross profit margin pressures to be partially offset by operational improvements, continuation of our end user strategy, the strength of our aftermarket business, selective contract bidding and savings achieved from our Realignment Programs. As part of our previously communicated Realignment Programs, we plan to incur up to $20 million in realignment costs in 2010 as a result of these activities. All of our borrowings under our Credit Facilities carry a floating rate of interest. As of December 31, 2009, we had $385.0 million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. As a result of reducing the volatility, we may not fully benefit from a decrease in interest rates. We expect our interest expense in 2010 will be comparable to 2009. However, because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest, the debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could negatively impact interest expense. Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Annual Report. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments, pension plan contributions and Realignment Programs in 2010. We seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory, and requiring progress payments from customers on long lead time projects. However, the amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues, backlog, customer acceptance and other factors. Additionally, tightening in our end markets may limit our ability to require progress payments from customers on new orders. In 2010, our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, ERP application upgrades, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between $110 million and $125 million, before consideration of any acquisition activity. We have $5.7 million in scheduled repayments in 2010 under our Credit Facilities, and we expect to comply with the covenants under our Credit Facilities in 2010. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for further discussion of our debt covenants. We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be between $30 million and $40 million, excluding direct benefits paid, in 2010 in order to maintain fully funded status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act, for 2010. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $10 million in 2010. Venezuela On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency (Bolivar) and move to a two-tier exchange structure effective January 11, 2010. The official exchange rate is expected to move from 2.15 to 4.30 Bolivars to the U.S. Dollar for non-essential items and to 2.60 Bolivars to the U.S. Dollar for essential items. Additionally, effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated as hyperinflationary, and as a result, we began to use the U.S. Dollar as our functional currency in Venezuela effective January 1, 2010. In accordance with hyperinflationary accounting, all future currency fluctuations between the Bolivar and the U.S. Dollar will be recorded in our statements of income. Our operations in Venezuela generally consist of a service center that imports equipment and parts from certain of our other locations for re-sale to third parties within Venezuela and performs service and repair activities. Our Venezuelan subsidiary sales in 2009 and total assets at December 31, 2009 represented approximately 1% or less of our consolidated sales and total assets for the same periods. Although approvals by Venezuela Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange have slowed, we have historically been able to remit dividends and other payments at the official rate, and we currently anticipate doing so in the future. Accordingly, at December 31, 2009, we used the official rate of 2.15 Bolivars to the U.S. Dollar for re-measurement and translation of our Venezuelan financial statements. Our preliminary assessment of the impact of the devaluation is that we will incur an after-tax charge of approximately $14 million in the first 51 Table of Contents quarter of 2010 as a result of re-measuring monetary assets and liabilities using the official rate of 4.30 Bolivars to the U.S. Dollar. We are currently assessing the ongoing impact of the currency devaluation on our Venezuelan operations and imports into the market, including the Venezuelan subsidiary ability to remit cash for dividends and other payments at the official rate, the potential ability of our imported products to be classified as essential items and the ability to recover exchange losses, as well as further actions of the Venezuelan government and economic conditions in Venezuela, such as inflation and capital spending. The hyperinflationary designation and currency devaluation had no impact on our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report. Segment Reorganization During the first quarter of 2010, we are reorganizing our divisional operations by combining FPD and FSD into the new Flow Solutions Group ( FSG ). We believe the combination of FPD and FSD enables us to continue building a strong customer focus for rotating equipment and related products and services, drive an enhanced customer-facing organization and further leverage best practices and capabilities. We expect the combined strength of FSG to provide greater efficiency for integrated component manufacturing, leverage in global spending and manufacturing resources and improve productivity through the use of common tools and processes to select, design, manufacture, distribute and service our product portfolio. FSG will be divided into two reportable segments based on type of product: Engineered and Industrial. Engineered will include the longer lead-time, highly engineered pump product operations of the former FPD and substantially all of the operations of the former FSD. Industrial will consist of the more standardized, general purpose pump product operations of the former FPD. FCD remains unchanged. This division reorganization had no effect on our reportable segments in 2009 and is not reflected in any of the accompanying financial information included in this Annual Report. Beginning in 2010, our segment reporting will reflect the structure described above, and prior periods will be retrospectively adjusted to conform to our 2010 reportable segment structure presentation. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009: Payments Due By Period Beyond 5 Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Total (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt $ 5.7 $ 538.3 $ $ $ 544.0 Fixed interest payments(1) 5.5 (0.4 ) 5.1 Variable interest payments(2) 10.0 13.2 23.2 Capital lease obligations 21.7 1.0 22.7 Operating leases 42.6 64.9 36.0 30.6 174.1 Purchase obligations:(3) Inventory 538.1 9.1 3.9 0.9 552.0 Non-inventory 47.4 8.1 2.0 57.5 Pension and postretirement benefits(4) 50.6 101.0 108.0 294.1 553.7 Total $ 721.6 $ 735.2 $ 149.9 $ 325.6 $ 1,932.3 (1) Fixed interest payments represent net incremental payments under interest rate swap agreements. (2) Variable interest payments under our Credit Facilities were estimated using a base rate of three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2009. (3) Purchase obligations are presented at the face value of the purchase order, excluding the effects of early termination provisions. Actual payments could be less than amounts presented herein. (4) Retirement and postretirement benefits represent estimated benefit payments for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical plan, as more fully described below and in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 52 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, the gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $130.2 million. We do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions. The following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at December 31, 2009: Commitment Expiration By Period Beyond 5 Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Total (Amounts in millions) Letters of credit $ 398.1 $ 143.3 $ 38.4 $ 4.9 $ 584.7 Surety bonds 40.0 6.3 2.3 48.6 Total $ 438.1 $ 149.6 $ 40.7 $ 4.9 $ 633.3 We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by ASC 715 Compensation Retirement Benefits. In accounting for retirement plans, management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, turnover, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Plan Descriptions We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 72% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 57% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2009. The assets for the U.S. qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service. Assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2009, the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to $427.2 million from $289.0 million at December 31, 2008. Assets were allocated as follows: U.S. Plan Asset category 2009 2008 U.S. Large Cap 39 % U.S. Small Cap 6 % International Large Cap 11 % Equity securities 56 % 66 % Long-Term Government / Credit 11 % Intermediate Bond 32 % Fixed income 43 % 30 % Multi-strategy hedge fund 1 % Other 0 % Other 1 % 4 % 53 Table of Contents Non-U.S. Plans Asset category 2009 2008 North American Companies 5 % U.K. Companies 27 % European Companies 8 % Asian Pacific Companies 5 % Global Equity 3 % Emerging Markets 0 % Equity securities 48 % 47 % U.K. Government Gilt Index 19 % U.K. Corporate Bond Index 15 % Global Fixed Income Bond 15 % Fixed income 49 % 51 % Other 3 % 2 % The projected benefit obligation ( Benefit Obligation ) for our defined benefit pension plans was $606.7 million and $532.4 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2010 is $1.2 million. The estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2010 is $12.3 million. We amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime of inactive participants for plans with only inactive participants. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $40.2 million and $43.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2010 is $1.9 million. The estimated actuarial net benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2010 is $2.3 million. We amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net gain over the remaining expected service period. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following 54 Table of Contents year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect Benefit Obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. See discussion of our assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the Our Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. In 2009, net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in income from continuing operations was $35.7 million compared with $29.5 million in 2008 and $32.1 million in 2007. The postretirement benefit (gain) expense for the postretirement medical plans was $(2.3) million in 2009 compared with $1.1 million in 2008 and $(0.1) million in 2007. The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2009: U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine Benefit Obligations: Discount rate 5.50 % 5.41 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.80 3.58 Weighted average assumptions used to determine 2009 net pension expense: Long-term rate of return on assets 7.75 % 4.38 % Discount rate 6.75 5.47 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.80 3.07 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% 0.5% Increase Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.0 ) $ 1.0 Effect on Benefit Obligation (12.3 ) 13.2 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (1.0 ) 1.2 Effect on Benefit Obligation (20.3 ) 21.8 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.1 ) 0.1 Effect on Benefit Obligation (1.0 ) 1.1 55 Table of Contents Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% 0.5% Increase Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.4 ) $ 1.4 Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (0.5 ) 0.5 Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense N/A N/A Effect on Benefit Obligation N/A N/A As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2009, as compared to December 31, 2008, we decreased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 6.75% to 5.50% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had a lower yield due to current market conditions. We decreased our average rate for non-U.S. plans from 5.47% to 5.41% based primarily on lower applicable iBoxx corporate AA bond indices for the United Kingdom and the Euro zone. We maintained our average assumed rate of compensation increase at 4.8% for the U.S. plan and increased the average rate of compensation increase for our Non-US plans from 3.07% to 3.58%. To determine the 2009 pension expense, we decreased the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets from 8.00% to 7.75% and we increased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 4.35% to 4.38%, primarily based on our target allocations and expected long-term asset returns. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be $0.3 million higher in 2010 than the $35.7 million in 2009, reflecting, among other things, the increased amortization of the actuarial net loss. We expect the 2010 benefit for the postretirement medical plan to be $2.2 million, primarily reflecting amortization of the increased actuarial net gain. We have used discount rates of 5.50% and 5.25% at December 31, 2009, in calculating our estimated 2010 cost of pension benefits and cost of other postretirement benefits for U.S. plans, respectively. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 9.0% for 2009, 7.8% for 2008 and 8.8% for 2007, with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2031 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $101.2 million, $71.0 million and $30.1 million to our defined benefit plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. After consideration of the impact of our contributions in 2009, the partial recovery in 2009 of asset value declines in 2008 and our intent to remain fully-funded, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2010 will be between $30 million and $40 million, excluding direct benefits paid, and we expect to contribute approximately $10 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. For further discussions on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of 56 Table of Contents related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent losses; retirement and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management, and management presents its views to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability. For contracts containing multiple elements, each having a determinable fair value, we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the element pro rata share of the contract fair value in accordance with the contractual delivery terms for each element. We defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Revenues for long-term contracts, which include contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer, are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Percentage of completion revenue represents less than 12% of our consolidated sales in 2009. Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to five years. Fixed fee service contracts represent less than 1% of our consolidated sales in 2009. In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In circumstances where the total projected reduced revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition. Our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance 57 Table of Contents and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur, and are included in retirement obligations and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. Estimated receivables are included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in claims filed, settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, rates of compensation increases and other factors. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. In our review we evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation rates. We also compare our significant assumptions with our peers. The methodology to set our assumptions are: Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an 58 Table of Contents analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the United Kingdom and the EURO zone we use the most applicable iBoxx corporate AA bond indices. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans liabilities. Health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data, long-term health care outlook and industry benchmarks. The inflation assumptions are based upon both our specific trends and nationally expected trends. The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates. Retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience. Mortality rates are based on published actuarial tables relevant to the countries in which we have plans. The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors, and discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets The initial recording of goodwill and intangibles requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units, which correlate to our operating segments. The test of indefinite-lived intangibles involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels. Impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2009, 2008 or 2007. We also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Our market capitalization increased in 2009 and did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2009. Impairment losses for intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a relief from royalty method, which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of the royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that are consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record an impairment of our trademarks in 2009, 2008 or 2007. The net realizable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, is reviewed periodically, when indicators of potential impairments are present, based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill. Additional considerations 59 Table of Contents related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS We have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
