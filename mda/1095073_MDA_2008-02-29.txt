ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Industry Conditions. The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market. As a result, financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability, high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity, low rates and constrained profitability. Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels. We compete in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. In 2007, we observed increased competition with generally lower rates, higher commissions and demands by cedants for improved terms and conditions. The extent of the increased competition and its effect on rates, terms and conditions varied widely by market and coverage types. One of the lesser impacted markets was worldwide property catastrophe retrocessional coverage. Reinsurance capacity in certain areas including southeastern U.S. exposures and energy lines continued to be constrained. In January 2007, the state of Florida passed legislation that increased coverage provided by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance that Florida companies needed to purchase from the private reinsurance market. In addition, the legislature broadened the mandate of the state sponsored homeowners insurance company to render it a fully competitive market participant. Although we are unable to predict the impact on future market conditions from the increased competition and legislative developments, we believe that our clients wrote profitable business in Florida during 2007 and will continue to purchase both quota share and catastrophe coverage, although at likely lower volumes. The balance of the U.S. and international property lines experienced mostly modest price declines but we believe they were adequately priced during the year. Our U.S. and international casualty lines experienced weaker market conditions, led by medical stop loss and D&O reinsurance, as well as the California workers compensation insurance line. Increased primary price competition and cedants increased appetite for retaining more profitable business net, following several highly profitable years, resulted in modestly softer, but still profitable, reinsurance pricing during the year. Our U.S. insurance operation was also affected by these primary casualty insurance market conditions; however, given the specialty nature of our business, we believe the impact on us to be less severe than on the market generally. 47 We are unable to predict the impact on future market conditions from increased competition and legislative initiatives. In addition to these market forces, reinsurers continue to reassess their risk appetites and rebalance their property portfolios to obtain a greater spread of risk against the backdrop of: (i) recent revisions to the industry catastrophe loss projection models, which are indicating significantly higher loss potentials and consequently higher pricing requirements and (ii) elevated rating agency scrutiny and capital requirements for many catastrophe exposed companies. In light of our 2005 catastrophe experience, we have re-examined our risk management practices and concluded that our control framework operated generally as intended. We rebalanced our property portfolio, particularly within peak catastrophe zones, including the Southeast U.S., Mexico and Gulf of Mexico. This effort has enabled us to benefit from market dislocations by carefully shifting the mix of our writings toward the most profitable classes, lines, customers and territories and by enhancing our portfolio balance and diversification. Overall, we believe that current marketplace conditions offer solid opportunities for us given our strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. We continue to employ our strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in our overall portfolio. 48 Financial Summary. We monitor and evaluate our overall performance based upon financial results. The following table displays a summary of the consolidated net income (loss), ratios and shareholders equity for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Gross written premiums $ 4,077.6 $ 4,000.9 $ 4,108.6 1.9% -2.6% Net written premiums 3,919.4 3,875.7 3,972.0 1.1% -2.4% REVENUES: Premiums earned $ 3,997.5 $ 3,853.2 $ 3,963.1 3.7% -2.8% Net investment income 682.4 629.4 522.8 8.4% 20.4% Net realized capital gains 86.3 35.1 90.3 146.1% -61.2% Net derivative expense (2.1) (0.4) (2.6) NM 84.4% Other income (expense) 18.0 0.1 (11.1) NM NM Total revenues 4,782.0 4,517.3 4,562.5 5.9% -1.0% CLAIMS AND EXPENSES: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 2,548.1 2,434.4 3,724.3 4.7% -34.6% Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees 961.8 883.3 914.8 8.9% -3.5% Other underwriting expenses 152.6 138.0 129.8 10.6% 6.3% Interest expense 91.6 69.9 74.4 31.0% -6.1% Total claims and expenses 3,754.1 3,525.6 4,843.4 6.5% -27.2% INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAXES 1,028.0 991.8 (281.0) 3.7% NM Income tax expense (benefit) 188.7 150.9 (62.3) 25.0% NM NET INCOME (LOSS) $ 839.3 $ 840.8 $ (218.7) -0.2% NM RATIOS: Point Change Loss ratio 63.7% 63.2% 94.0% 0.5 (30.8) Commission and brokerage ratio 24.1% 22.9% 23.1% 1.2 (0.2) Other underwriting expense ratio 3.8% 3.6% 3.2% 0.2 0.4 Combined ratio 91.6% 89.7% 120.3% 1.9 (30.6) At December 31, Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Balance sheet data: Total investments and cash $ 14,936.2 $ 13,957.1 $ 12,970.8 7.0% 7.6% Total assets 17,999.5 17,107.6 16,474.5 5.2% 3.8% Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 9,040.6 8,840.1 9,126.7 2.3% -3.1% Total debt 1,178.9 995.6 995.5 18.4% 0.0% Total liabilities 12,314.7 11,999.9 12,334.8 2.6% -2.7% Shareholders' equity 5,684.8 5,107.7 4,139.7 11.3% 23.4% Book value per share 90.43 78.53 64.04 (NM, not meaningful) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) 49 Revenues. Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by $76.7 million, or 1.9%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting growth of $57.4 million in the worldwide reinsurance business and a $19.3 million increase in the U.S. Insurance business. The increase in worldwide reinsurance is primarily attributable to the strengthening of other currencies against the U.S. dollar. Premiums written in strengthening currencies convert to more U.S. dollars resulting in comparatively higher reported premiums. Net written premiums increased $43.7 million, or 1.1%, in 2007 compared to 2006, slightly less than the growth in gross written premiums due to the change in the mix of our program business and the resulting change in reinsurance. Net premiums earned increased $144.3 million, or 3.7%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The greater percentage increase in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums decreased by $107.7 million, or 2.6% in 2006 compared to 2005, as we repositioned our U.S. property reinsurance portfolio resulting in improved pricing, but lower premium volume; other factors were the run-off of the insurance credit program business and a reduction in treaty casualty writings in response to market softening in many U.S. casualty reinsurance classes. Net written premiums also decreased by $96.3 million, or 2.4% in 2006 compared to 2005, in line with the percentage reduction in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned declined by $109.9 million, or 2.8% in 2006 compared to 2005. Net Investment Income . Net investment income increased 8.4% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the growth in invested assets. The growth in invested assets was principally driven by $854.4 million of operating cash flows and appreciation in portfolio assets. The average pre-tax investment portfolio yield for 2007 was 4.9% compared to the average investment portfolio yield of 4.8% for 2006. Net investment income increased 20.4% in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting continued year-over-year growth in invested assets from the $636.3 million cash flow from operations and a $43.2 million increase in income from limited partnership investments. The average investment portfolio yield for 2006 was 4.8% compared to 2005 average investment portfolio yield of 4.4%. Net Realized Capital Gains. Net realized capital gains were $86.3 million, $35.1 million and $90.3 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2007 is primarily attributable to our adoption on January 1, 2007, of FAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an amendment to FASB statement No. 115 ( FAS 159 ) for our actively managed equity security investment portfolio. In 2007, we recorded $76.6 million of net realized capital gains due to fair value re-measurements. Net Derivative Expense. We sold seven equity index put options, which are outstanding. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative under FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( FAS 133 ). We recognized net derivative expense of $2.1 million, $0.4 million and $2.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which represent changes in the fair value of these contracts year over year. Other Income (Expense) . For 2007 and 2006, we recorded other income of $18.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively, and for 2005 other expense of $11.1 million. The fluctuations in net other income (expense) were primarily due to the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 50 Claims and Expenses. Incurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. The following table presents our incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ) for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 Variance 2006/2005 Variance Current Prior Total Current Prior Total Current Prior Total Current Prior Total Current Prior Total (Dollars in millions) Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred All Segments Attritional (a) $ 2,189.3 $ (188.7) $2,000.6 $2,283.2 $ (243.3) $2,039.9 $2,383.6 $ (226.3) $ 2,157.2 $ (93.9) $ 54.6 $ (39.3) $ (100.4) $ (17.0) $ (117.3) Catastrophes 152.3 7.7 160.0 15.6 272.3 287.9 1,367.2 118.5 1,485.7 136.7 (264.6) (127.9) (1,351.6) 153.8 (1,197.8) A&E - 387.5 387.5 - 106.6 106.6 - 81.4 81.4 - 280.9 280.9 - 25.2 25.2 Total segment $ 2,341.6 $ 206.5 $ 2,548.1 $2,298.8 $ 135.6 $2,434.4 $3,750.7 $ (26.4) $ 3,724.3 $ 42.8 $ 70.9 $ 113.7 $ (1,451.9) $ 162.0 $ (1,289.9) Loss ratio 58.6% 5.2% 63.7% 59.7% 3.5% 63.2% 94.6% -0.7% 94.0% (1.1) 1.7 0.5 (34.9) 4.2 (30.8) (a) Attritional losses exclude catastrophe and A&E losses (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses and LAE increased by $113.7 million, or 4.7% in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, principally as a result of the $280.9 million increase in A&E loss reserve strengthening, which was partially offset by a $127.9 million decrease in catastrophe losses and a $39.3 million decrease in attritional losses. The increase in A&E reserves was due to an extensive in-house study by our actuarial and claim units. The decrease in catastrophe losses reflects the decrease in prior years development. Incurred losses and LAE decreased by $1,289.9 million, or 34.6% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to significantly reduced current year catastrophe losses and a reduction in current and prior years attritional losses, partially offset by increased prior years reserve development on catastrophe and A&E losses. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $1,485.7 million in 2005, related principally to aggregate estimated losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Our current year attritional loss ratios for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 54.8%, 59.3% and 60.2%, respectively, reflective of generally favorable market conditions and our business production and risk selection practices. We have also recorded favorable development on our attritional loss reserves aggregating $658.3 million over the past three years. The $272.3 million of adverse development on catastrophe loss reserves experienced in 2006 largely emanated from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The unprecedented size and widespread damage from these events, particularly Katrina, made projecting ultimate losses extremely difficult. Commission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees. Commission, brokerage, and tax expenses increased by $78.5 million, or 8.9% in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net earned premiums, an increase in ceding commissions due to market conditions and higher commissions on new insurance programs were the principal drivers of the increase in this directly variable expense. Commission, brokerage, and tax expenses decreased $31.5 million, or 3.5% in 2006 compared to 2005, generally in line with the decrease in premiums earned of 2.8%. Other Underwriting Expenses. Other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased by $14.6 million, or 10.6%, compared to 2006, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and an increased staff count, primarily in the U.S. Insurance segment. Included in other underwriting expenses were corporate underwriting expenses, which are expenses that are not allocated to segments, of $13.1 million for 2007 compared to $26.5 51 million for 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the allocation of share-based compensation expense in 2007 to segments. Other underwriting expenses for 2006 increased by $8.2 million, or 6.3%, compared to 2005, primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $91.6 million and $69.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase was due to the new long term notes we issued in April, 2007 and the acceleration of the bond amortization costs associated with the November 15, 2007 early retirement of the 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities. Interest expense was $69.9 million and $74.4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the retirement on March 15, 2005 of the 8.5% senior notes issued on March 14, 2000. Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Our income tax expense was $188.7 million, which represented an 18.4% effective tax rate for 2007 compared to $150.9 million, which represented a 15.2% effective tax rate for 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate is principally due to the increase and jurisdictional mix in pre-tax income, including a significant increase in net realized gains and the $12.3 million provision for potential additional tax related to our tax treatment of foreign exchange. Absent this provision, the tax rate would have been 17.2%. The Internal Revenue Service has challenged our foreign exchange treatment, and although we believe we have a strong chance of prevailing on this issue, we have provided for the potential additional tax for all years still open for examination. Aside from such discrete items, our income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding pre-tax income in the jurisdictions where we operate, coupled with the impact from tax-preferenced investment income. Variations in our effective tax rate generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income among jurisdictions with different tax rates. Our income tax expense was $150.9 million, which represented a 15.2% effective tax rate for 2006 compared to an income tax benefit of $62.3 million, which represented a 22.2% effective tax rate for 2005. The fluctuation in the effective tax rate is principally due to the impact of the large catastrophe losses in 2005. Net Income (Loss). Net income was slightly lower at $839.3 million for 2007 compared to $840.8 million for 2006, as a result of the changes in the various statement lines discussed above. Net income increased significantly to $840.8 million in 2006 compared to a net loss of $218.7 million for 2005. This earnings improvement reflected the favorable effect of a benign U.S. hurricane season relative to unprecedented Company and industry hurricane losses experienced in 2005, as well as favorable underlying underwriting fundamentals. Ratios. Our combined ratio increased by 1.9 points to 91.6% in 2007 compared to 89.7% in 2006, principally driven by the 1.2 point increase in the commission and brokerage ratio, followed by the 0.5 point increase in the loss ratio and the 0.2 point increase in the other underwriting expense ratio. Our combined ratio decreased by 30.6 points to 89.7% in 2006 compared to 120.3% in 2005, reflective of the lower catastrophe and attritional losses. Shareholders Equity. Shareholders equity increased by $0.6 billion to $5.7 billion in 2007 from $5.1 billion in 2006, principally as a result of the $839.3 million of net income generated for the period, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.5 million common shares at a cost of $241.6 million and the payment of $121.4 million of shareholder dividends. 52 Shareholders equity increased by $1.0 billion to $5.1 billion in 2006 from $4.1 billion in 2005, principally as a result of the $840.8 million of net income generated for the period and $88.4 million of after-tax appreciation from our investment portfolio, partially offset by the payment of $39.0 million of shareholder dividends. Consolidated Investment Results Net Investment Income. Net investment income increased 8.4% to $682.4 million in 2007 from $629.4 million in 2006, principally reflecting a growth in invested assets to $14.9 billion at December 31, 2007 from $14.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The asset growth emanated largely from continued positive cash flow from operations. Net investment income increased 20.4% to $629.4 million in 2006 from $522.8 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the growth in invested assets to $14.0 billion at December 31, 2006 from $13.0 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition, growth in limited partnership income of $43.2 million contributed to the increase. The following table shows the components of net investment income for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Fixed maturities $ 496.6 $ 508.5 $ 497.0 Equity securities 25.8 22.3 16.6 Short-term investments 100.3 56.8 20.1 Other investment income 70.0 60.7 14.6 Total gross investment income 692.7 648.4 548.3 Interest credited and other expense (10.3) (19.0) (25.4) Total net investment income $ 682.4 $ 629.4 $ 522.8 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding) The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated: 2007 2006 2005 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.7% 4.6% 4.5% Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 3.9% 4.0% 3.9% Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.9% 4.8% 4.4% Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.1% 4.2% 3.8% 53 Because of our historical income orientation, we had generally managed our investments to maximize reportable income. Starting in 2004, we began investing a portion of our assets in equity securities, principally in response to perceived changes in the relative attractiveness of the debt and equity markets. The following table provides a comparison of our total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated. 2007 2006 2005 Fixed income portfolio total return 5.0% 4.6% 3.2% Lehman bond aggregate index 7.0% 4.3% 2.4% Common equity portfolio total return 9.2% 19.2% 13.8% S & P 500 index 5.5% 15.8% 4.9% Other invested asset portfolio total return 13.5% 19.8% 7.2% The pre-tax equivalent return for the bond portfolio was approximately 5.7%, 5.3% and 3.7%, respectively, for 2007, 2006 and 2005. The pre-tax equivalent return adjusts the yield on tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent. 54 Net Realized Capital Gains.

As such, we recorded $76.6 million of net realized gains from fair value re-measurements in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for 2007. 55 Segment Results. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes non-U.S. property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re branches in Canada and Singapore and offices in Miami and New Jersey. The Bermuda operation provides insurance and reinsurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch. These segments are managed in a coordinated fashion with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. We measure our underwriting results using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. We utilize inter-affiliate reinsurance, although such reinsurance does not materially impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced. Our loss and LAE reserves are our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including all prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, recently reported loss claim experience and trends related to prior periods. Such re-evaluations are recorded in incurred losses in the period in which re-evaluation is made. 56 The following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods indicated: U.S. Reinsurance. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Reinsurance segment for the periods indicated.

Gross written premiums decreased by 10.7% to $1,193.5 million in 2007 from $1,336.7 million in 2006, primarily due to a $202.6 million (37.9%) decrease in treaty casualty volume and a $70.5 million (32.7%) decrease in facultative volume, partially offset by a $126.8 million (21.6%) increase in treaty property volume. The increase in treaty property writings emanated principally from new quota share treaties. The more competitive environment for the U.S. casualty business resulted in reduced opportunities to write this business profitably. Net written premiums decreased 11.2% to $1,183.1 million in 2007 compared to $1,331.7 million in 2006, primarily due to the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased slightly to $1,282.9 million for 2007 compared to $1,281.1 million for 2006. The change in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums decreased 3.6% to $1,336.7 million in 2006 from $1,386.2 million in 2005, primarily due to a $72.7 million (12.0%) decrease in treaty casualty volume, partially offset by a $16.4 million (2.9%) increase in treaty property volume and an $11.6 million (5.7%) increase in facultative volume. Net written premiums decreased 3.8% to $1,331.7 million in 2006 compared to $1,383.7 million in 2005, primarily due to the decrease in gross written premiums.Net premiums earned decreased 8.2% to $1,281.1 million for 2006 compared to $1,396.1 million for 2005.

The current year attritional loss ratio improved by 7.9 points due to results from increased property quota share business. We experienced $181.7 million of catastrophe loss development in 2006 which did not recur in 2007, which contributed another 14.6 points. In addition, we had a greater amount of favorable reserve development related to prior years, which provided 7.0 points of improvement. These favorable factors were partially mitigated by an 18.6 point increase driven by asbestos reserve strengthening. Incurred losses and LAE decreased 42.5% to $851.2 million for 2006 compared to $1,479.6 million for 2005, primarily due to significantly reduced catastrophe losses, principally within the treaty property unit and decreased earned premiums. The segment loss ratio improved by 39.6 points for 2006 compared to 2005. The factors driving this change were a favorable 35.8 point decrease in catastrophe losses and a 5.1 point decrease in the attritional loss ratio. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage expenses increased by 9.8% to $327.2 million for 2007 from $298.1 million in 2006, principally due to an $18.9 million increase in contingent commissions and somewhat higher base ceding commissions, generally. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $33.3 million from $24.9 million for 2006, principally due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased by 16.8% to $298.1 million in 2006 from $358.1 million in 2005, principally due to decreased earned premium volume and the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2006 increased nominally to $24.9 million from $24.0 million for 2005. 58 U.S. Insurance. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Insurance segment for the periods indicated.

Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 2.2% to $885.6 million for 2007 from $866.3 million for 2006. The increase is primarily the result of a new program we assumed late in 2007 for approximately $76 million of gross written premium. Absent this new program, gross written premiums would have decreased due to the further decline in our workers compensation and contractors liability writings in response to increased competition. Net written premiums decreased by 1.2% to $744.3 million for 2007 compared to $753.3 million for 2006 as our retention level fell slightly. Net premiums earned decreased 3.4% to $735.9 million for 2007 from $761.7 million for 2006. The change in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums decreased by 7.1% to $866.3 million for 2006 from $932.5 million for 2005. The decrease was primarily the result of declines in our workers compensation and contractors liability writings in response to increased competition, partially offset by some growth from new programs. Net written premiums decreased 7.6% to $753.3 million for 2006 compared to $815.3 million for 2005, primarily due to the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned decreased 7.5% to $761.7 million for 2006 from $823.0 million for 2005, in line with the decrease in net written premiums. 59 Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses and LAE increased by 7.0% to $556.4 million for 2007 from $519.9 million for 2006 as the segment loss ratio increased by 7.3% to 75.6%. From a ratio perspective, the swing in prior years development from favorable in 2006 to adverse in 2007 resulted in 14.0 points of increase. The adverse development in 2007 was the result of $60 million of adverse reserve run-off on a canceled auto loan credit insurance program, partially offset by favorable development on the remainder of the reserves. The 2007 accident year loss ratio was 70.5% which was 6.7 points lower than 2006. The 2006 accident year loss ratio was negatively impacted by the auto loan credit insurance program referenced above. Incurred losses and LAE decreased 2.0% to $519.9 million for 2006 from $530.8 million for 2005, primarily due to lower earned premiums, which related to the reduction in the California workers compensation business and cancellation of the auto loan credit insurance program. The segment loss ratio increased 3.8 points, primarily due to higher losses on the auto loan credit insurance program. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage increased by 10.6% to $136.2 million for 2007 from $123.1 million in 2006, principally due to an increase in regular commission on new programs and profit commissions. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $58.2 million as compared to $48.9 million for 2006, primarily due to increased compensation costs associated with increased staff and the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased 7.2% to $123.1 million for 2006 from $132.6 million in 2005, principally due to a decrease in written and earned premiums. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2006 decreased to $48.9 million as compared to $51.9 million for 2005. 60 Specialty Underwriting. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Specialty Underwriting segment for the periods indicated.

Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 7.5% to $270.1 million for 2007 from $251.2 million for 2006. This increase was the result of a $36.9 million (58.7%) increase in marine writings and a $12.2 million (14.7%) increase in A&H writings, partially offset by a $24.6 million (34.9%) decrease in surety writings and a $5.7 million (16.5%) decrease in aviation writings. The increased marine premium growth emanated from growth in existing quota share business as well as new quota share contracts. We continued to decrease our aviation and surety writings, in response to more competitive market conditions. Net written premiums increased 8.2% to $263.8 million for 2007 compared to $243.8 million for 2006, as a result of the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 7.2% to $262.0 million for 2007 compared to $244.5 million for 2006, generally in line with the growth in net written premiums. By line of business, we experienced a $31.2 million (51.7%) increase in marine premium and a $14.0 million (18.2%) increase in A&H premium, partially offset by a $21.9 million (30.3%) decrease in surety premium and a $5.2 million (14.9%) decrease in aviation premium, which is in line with the change in gross and net written premiums. The change in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums decreased 20.2% to $251.2 million for 2006 from $314.6 million for 2005. This decrease was the result of a $53.2 million (39.0%) decrease in A&H writings, a $14.8 million (19.0%) decrease in marine writings and an $8.9 million (20.5%) decrease in aviation writings, partially offset by a $13.4 million (23.5%) increase in surety writings. Net written premiums decreased 18.5% to $243.8 million for 2006 compared to $299.3 million for 2005, due to the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned decreased 18.9% to $244.5 million for 2006 compared to $301.5 million for 2005, generally in line with the growth in net written premiums. By line of business, we experienced a $51.2 million (40.1%) decrease in A&H business, a $17.8 million (22.7%) decrease in marine business and a $7.4 million (17.7%) decrease in aviation business, partially offset by an increase of $19.0 million (35.5%) in surety business. 61 Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses and LAE increased 5.7% to $173.3 million for 2007 compared to $163.9 million for 2006, generally proportional to the increase in net earned premiums. The loss ratio for the current accident year was slightly lower in 2007 compared to 2006. We experienced 10.2 points of adverse development in 2007 compared to 9.3 points in 2006. Catastrophe loss development, principally within the marine business related to Hurricane Katrina, was the driver of the overall development in both 2007 and 2006. Incurred losses and LAE decreased 48.4% to $163.9 million for 2006 compared to $317.9 million for 2005. The segment loss ratio was 38.5 points lower in 2006 than 2005, principally due to decreased catastrophe losses in 2006. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage increased 1.0% to $68.5 million in 2007 from $67.8 million in 2006 due primarily to premium growth. Segment other underwriting expenses increased 28.8% to $8.5 million for 2007 from $6.6 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased 14.9% to $67.8 million in 2006 from $79.7 million in 2005, primarily due to the decrease in writings. Segment other underwriting expenses decreased 2.9% to $6.6 million for 2006 from $6.8 million for 2005. 62 International.

Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 10.1% to $805.9 million for 2007 from $731.7 million for 2006. Approximately half of this increase was attributable to the impact of other currencies strengthening against the U.S. dollar. We wrote reinsurance contracts in multiple currencies and as these currencies strengthened and were converted to U.S. dollars for financial reporting, they converted to higher dollar values. Business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices increased by $35.0 million (8.0%), business written through the Asian branch increased by $22.3 million (15.6%) and business written through the Canadian branch increased by $17.9 million (11.8%). We have experienced strong fundamental growth in geographic areas where economic growth and demand for reinsurance is strong. Net written premiums increased by 10.3% to $806.0 million for 2007 compared to $730.7 million for 2006, principally as a result of the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 11.7% to $803.8 million for 2007 compared to $719.5 million for 2006, consistent with the increase in net written premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 3.6% to $731.7 million for 2006 from $706.6 million for 2005. Business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices increased by $47.1 million (12.1%) and business written through the Canadian branch increased by $22.8 million (17.7%). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $44.1 million (23.5%) in premiums written through the Asian branch. Net written premiums increased by 3.7% to $730.7 million for 2006 compared to $704.9 million for 2005, in line with the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased by 5.3% to $719.5 million for 2006 compared to $683.4 million for 2005, consistent with the increase in net written premiums. 63 Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses and LAE increased by 31.1% to $501.9 million for 2007 compared to $382.8 million for 2006. The segment loss ratio increased by 9.2 points, principally due to an increase in the catastrophe loss ratio by 6.1 points. In 2007, catastrophe losses included Tabasco, Mexico floods, $28.5 million; New South Wales storm, $21.1 million; Peruvian earthquake, $10.0 million; Hurricane Dean, $9.0 million and Jakarta flood, $6.8 million. The 2007 accident year attritional loss ratio was 54.2%, about the same as 2006; however, the reduction in favorable reserve development, year over year, accounted for 3 points of the increase in the segment loss ratio in 2007 compared to 2006. Incurred losses and LAE decreased 33.4% to $382.8 million for 2006 compared to $574.7 million for 2005. The segment loss ratio decreased by 30.9 points, principally due to reduced current year catastrophe losses in Canada, Asia and International. The catastrophe losses for 2005 included the impact from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage increased 10.5% to $199.5 million for 2007 from $180.5 million in 2006, which was in line with the increase in premiums. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $18.6 million compared to $13.8 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. Commission and brokerage increased 8.1% to $180.5 million for 2006 from $167.0 million in 2005. Segment other underwriting expenses increased 9.5% to $13.8 million compared to $12.6 million for 2005. 64 Bermuda. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Bermuda segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2007/2006 2006/2005 (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Variance % Change Variance % Change Gross written premiums $ 922.5 $ 814.9 $ 768.7 $ 107.6 13.2% $ 46.2 6.0% Net written premiums 922.3 816.2 768.8 106.1 13.0% 47.4 6.2% Premiums earned $ 912.9 $ 846.4 $ 759.1 $ 66.5 7.9% $ 87.3 11.5% Incurred losses and LAE 611.2 516.6 821.4 94.6 18.3% (304.8) -37.1% Commission and brokerage 230.4 213.7 177.5 16.7 7.8% 36.2 20.4% Other underwriting expenses 20.9 17.2 16.2 3.7 21.5% 1.0 6.2% Underwriting gain (loss) $ 50.4 $ 99.0 $ (256.0) $ (48.6) -49.1% $ 355.0 138.7% Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 67.0% 61.0% 108.2% 6.0 (47.2) Commission and brokerage ratio 25.2% 25.3% 23.4% (0.1) 1.9 Other underwriting expense ratio 2.3% 2.0% 2.1% 0.3 (0.1) Combined ratio 94.5% 88.3% 133.7% 6.2 (45.4) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Premiums. Gross written premiums increased 13.2% to $922.5 million for 2007 compared to $814.9 million for 2006. Premiums written from the Bermuda office increased $61.0 million, or 22.9%, and premiums written from the UK office increased $47.3 million, or 8.6%. The increase in the Bermuda office premiums was driven by growth in worldwide treaty casualty reinsurance business and approximately half of the increase from the UK office was driven by the Pound Sterling currency strengthening against the U.S. dollar during 2007. Net written premiums increased 13.0% to $922.3 million for 2007 compared to $816.2 million for 2006, commensurate with the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 7.9% to $912.9 million for 2007 compared to $846.4 million for 2006. The change in net premiums earned relative to the net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums increased 6.0% to $814.9 million for 2006 compared to $768.7 million for 2005. Premiums written from the UK office increased $72.4 million, or 15.2%, and premiums written from the Bermuda office decreased $26.5 million, or 9.0%. Contributing to the growth was a slight increase in both the worldwide casualty and property business. Net written premiums increased 6.2% to $816.2 million for 2006 compared to $768.8 million for 2005, as the result of the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 11.5% to $846.4 million for 2006 compared to $759.1 million for 2005. 65 Incurred Losses and LAE. The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the Bermuda segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 Variance 2006/2005 Variance Current Prior Total Current Prior Total Current Prior Total Current Prior Total Current Prior Total (Dollars in millions) Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred Year Years Incurred Attritional $ 505.2 $ (79.4) $ 425.8 $ 481.2 $ (54.4) $ 426.7 $ 437.8 $ (44.4) $ 393.5 $ 24.0 $ (25.0) $ (0.9) $ 43.4 $ (10.0) $ 33.2 Catastrophes 76.3 (12.1) 64.2 - 10.7 10.7 345.9 12.2 358.0 76.3 (22.8) 53.5 (345.9) (1.5) (347.3) A&E - 121.2 121.2 - 79.2 79.2 - 69.9 69.9 - 42.0 42.0 - 9.3 9.3 Total segment $ 581.6 $ 29.6 $ 611.2 $ 481.2 $ 35.4 $ 516.6 $ 783.7 $ 37.7 $ 821.4 $ 100.4 $ (5.8) $ 94.6 $ (302.5) $ (2.3) $ (304.8) Loss ratio 63.7% 3.2% 67.0% 56.8% 4.2% 61.0% 103.2% 5.0% 108.2% 6.9 (1.0) 6.0 (46.4) (0.8) (47.2) (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses and LAE increased 18.3% to $611.2 million for 2007 compared to $516.6 million for 2006. The segment loss ratio for Bermuda increased 6.0 points, reflecting a 5.7 point increase in catastrophe losses and a 3.9 point increase for A&E losses, partially offset by a 3.8 point decrease for attritional losses. The current year catastrophe losses include winter storm Kyrill and the June and July, 2007 London floods. The increase in A&E losses was due to the strengthening of asbestos reserves, principally for the direct business. Incurred losses and LAE decreased 37.1% to $516.6 million for 2006 compared to $821.4 million for 2005. The segment loss ratio for Bermuda decreased 47.2 points, reflecting a 45.9 point decrease for catastrophe losses and a 1.4 point decrease for attritional losses, partially offset by a slight increase for A&E losses. The catastrophe losses for 2005 were primarily driven by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage increased 7.8% to $230.4 million for 2007 from $213.7 million for 2006, principally due to increases in premiums earned. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $20.9 million compared to $17.2 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses. Commission and brokerage increased 20.4% to $213.7 million for 2006 from $177.5 million in 2005, principally due to increases in premiums earned and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2006 increased 6.2% to $17.2 million compared to $16.2 million for 2005, generally in line with the growth in gross written premiums. 66 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions. Loss and LAE Reserves. Our most critical accounting policy is the determination of our loss and LAE reserves. We maintain reserves equal to our estimated ultimate liability for losses and LAE for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and LAE by underwriting or accident year, we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time, evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted. We consider many factors when setting reserves including: (1) our exposure base and projected ultimate premiums earned; (2) our expected loss ratios by product and class of business, which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries; (3) actuarial methodologies which analyze our loss reporting and payment experience, reports from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) uncertainties discussed below regarding our liability for A&E claims. Based on these considerations, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for our insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves. Our net income will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and LAE is recorded. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe it is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities. At December 31, 2007 we had reinsurance reserves of $6,841.5 million and insurance loss reserves of $2,199.1 million, of which $585.3 million and $273.6 million, respectively, were loss reserves for A&E liabilities. A detailed discussion of additional considerations related to A&E exposures follows later in this section. The detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems. Reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies. Ceding companies report losses to us in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information is recorded into our records. For certain proportional contracts, we may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur. Our experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information. Based on our evaluation of a claim, we may establish additional case reserves (ACRs) in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company. To ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data, the Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of our ceding companies, particularly larger ceding companies, including on-site audits. We sort both our reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis. We assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses. We periodically review our exposure groupings and we may change our grouping over time as our business changes. We currently use over 200 exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates. One of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process. Business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines, principally 67 property lines. On the other hand, casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines. Our estimates of ultimate losses for shorter tail lines, with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events, generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines. We use similar actuarial methodologies, such as expected loss ratio, chain ladder reserving methods and Borhuetter Ferguson, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, to estimate our ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Although we use similar actuarial methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines, the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines. As a result, we utilize, as well, exposure-based methods to estimate our ultimate losses for longer tail lines, especially for immature accident years. For both short and long tail lines, we supplement these general approaches with analytically based judgments. We cannot estimate losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, using traditional actuarial methods. We estimate losses for these types of events based on information derived from catastrophe models, quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses, reports and communications from ceding companies and development patterns for historically similar events. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these estimates are subject to variability, which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event. Our key actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor do we supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty. Our carried reserves at each reporting date are our best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and LAE at that date. We complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for our reinsurance operations and quarterly for our insurance operations. The completed annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed. The roll-forward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study. We analyze significant variances between actual and expected losses and post adjustments to our reserves as warranted recorded. Given the inherent variability in our loss reserves, we have developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels. A table of ranges by segment, accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability, is included in Financial Condition - Loss and LAE Reserves . The ranges are statistically developed using the exposure groups used in the reserve estimation process and aggregated to the segment level. For each exposure group, our actuaries calculate a range for each accident year based principally on two variables. The first is the historical changes in losses and LAE incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) for each accident year over time; the second is volatility of each accident year held reserves related to estimated ultimate losses, also over time. Both are measured at various ages from the end of the accident year through the final payout of the year losses. Ranges are developed for the exposure groups using statistical methods to adjust for diversification; the ranges for the exposure groups are aggregated to the segment level, likewise, with an adjustment for diversification. Our estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. Our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities and our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates, we calculate the ranges subsequently, based on the historical variability of such reserves. Asbestos and Environmental Exposures. We continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts, asserting injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. Environmental claims typically assert liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damage caused by the 68 release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. Asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. Our reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for A&E claims. Our A&E liabilities emanate from Mt. McKinley direct insurance business and Everest Re assumed reinsurance business. There are significant uncertainties surrounding our estimates of our potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure. With respect to asbestos claims in particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating our liability. These developments include: (a) the significant growth over a short period of time in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants who may only have a peripheral connection to asbestos; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional injury, which should have little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of asbestos related bankruptcy reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims where coverage is sought under the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants, especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U.S. Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that new claims filing rates have decreased, that new filings of asbestos-driven bankruptcies have decreased and that various procedural and legislative reforms are beginning to diminish the potential ultimate liability for asbestos losses. We believe that these uncertainties continue to render reserves for A&E, and particularly asbestos losses, significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves for other types of losses. We establish reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for us or our ceding companies. In connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed LM obligations to Mt. McKinley. Coverage under this reinsurance agreement was exhausted as of December 31, 2003. We have direct relationships with Mt. McKinley policyholders and we attempt to uphold our contractual rights and assert valid defenses to coverage where appropriate. The uncertainties inherent in asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigations have provided us the opportunity to engage in settlement negotiations with a number of policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities. Those discussions are aimed at achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that limit Mt. McKinley liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot be certain that this approach will lead to a negotiated settlement in the range expected by us in each or every instance. Between 2004 and 2006, we 69 concluded settlements or reached agreement in principle with 16 of our high profile policyholders. We currently have identified 7 policyholders based on their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as high profile policyholders and we attempt to negotiate with such policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where we and the policyholder have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. We believe that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley liabilities than a passive approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the developments in litigation, negotiations and, ultimately, potential settlements. There is little potential for similar settlements of our reinsurance asbestos claims where we have no direct relationships with the insureds. Our ceding companies have the direct obligation to insureds and are responsible for their own claim settlements. They are not consistently prompt in developing and providing claim settlement information to their reinsurers, which can introduce inconsistencies and significant delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers, including us. These delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also limit the available information from which reinsurers, including us, estimate their ultimate exposure. See the discussion below under the heading Financial Condition Loss and LAE Reserves . Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reinsurance Receivables. We have purchased reinsurance to reduce our exposure to adverse claim experience, large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. Our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances. Such reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders. In the event our reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts, we will not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance receivable balance. To minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables, we have a reinsurance security committee that evaluates the financial strength of each reinsurer prior to our entering into a reinsurance arrangement. In some cases, we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable, including letters of credit, trust assets and cash. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. We have established reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the reserve for uncollectible balances was $173.0 million and $87.0 million, respectively. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for our uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Condition Reinsurance Receivables below. Premiums Written and Earned. Premiums written by us are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts. We establish unearned premium reserves to cover the unexpired portion of each contract. Such reserves are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data received from ceding companies. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to us, are estimated and accrued. Because of the inherent lag in the reporting of written and earned premiums by our ceding companies, we use standard accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned premiums to comprise our total premiums earned for determination of our incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium are included in current period company and segment financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 The following table displays the estimated components of earned but not reported premiums by segment for the periods indicated: At December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) U.S. Reinsurance $ 405.3 $ 426.2 $ 549.9 U.S. Insurance 13.7 16.5 21.3 Specialty Underwriting 82.8 85.2 85.0 International 178.5 199.9 225.7 Bermuda 202.2 160.6 121.1 Total $ 882.5 $ 888.4 $ 1,002.9 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Investment Valuation. Our fixed income investments are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale and are carried at market value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our actively managed equity securities are also held as available for sale and are carried at fair value at December 31, 2007, due to the adoption of FAS 159 effective January 1, 2007. In prior periods our equity securities were carried at market value; however, there is no practical distinction between fair value and market value for our securities since all are actively traded. Most securities we own are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. We hold some privately placed securities, less than 0.5% of the portfolio that are either valued by brokers or an investment advisor. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our investment portfolio included $623.6 million and $442.5 million, respectively, of limited partnership investments whose values are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting. We carry these investments at values provided by the managements of the limited partnerships and due to inherent reporting lags, the carrying values are based on values as of dates from one month to one quarter prior to our financial statement date. In 2005, we owned interest only strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which sets forth the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to impairment. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had net unrealized gains, net of tax, of $73.2 million and $302.9 million, respectively. Gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as comprehensive income for the fixed income portfolio and also for the equity portfolio prior to January 1, 2007. Subsequent to January 1, 2007, gains and losses from market fluctuations for the equity portfolio are reflected as realized capital gains and losses in accordance with the provisions of FAS 159. Market value declines for the fixed income portfolio, which are considered other than temporary impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses. We consider many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time the market value has been below book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the issuer market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed securities, increases in prepayments and underlying default rates. If management assessments change in the future, we may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 71 FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash and Invested Assets. Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $14,936.2 million at December 31, 2007, up by $979.1 million, compared to $13,957.1 million at December 31, 2006. This increase is primarily the result of $854.4 million of cash flows from operations, $395.6 million of net proceeds from the long term debt issuance, $100.6 million of realized capital gains on equity securities, $167.4 million from foreign exchange and $18.2 million from share-based compensation, partially offset by the repurchase in the open market of 2.5 million common shares for $241.6 million, $210.0 million of trust preferred securities redemption, $121.4 million in dividends to shareholders and $21.4 million of unrealized depreciation, primarily on fixed maturities due to rising interest rates. Our principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our investment portfolio as having two components: 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by our shareholders equity. For outstanding liabilities, we invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa, as rated by Moody s, an independent investment rating service. We continually adjust our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments in light of our current and projected operating results, market conditions and tax position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines developed by us. Over the past few years, we have reallocated our shareholders equity investment portfolio to include 1) publicly traded equity securities, primarily individual equity securities intended to emulate the performance of specific exchange traded funds or equity indexes or exchange traded funds, and 2) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes. We have limited our allocation to these asset classes because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At December 31, 2007, the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated 38% of shareholders equity. 72 The tables below summarize the composition and characteristics of our investment portfolio for the periods indicated: December 31, 2007 2006 Fixed maturities 68.6% 73.9% Equity securities - market value 0.1% 11.6% Equity securities - fair value 10.3% - Short-term investments 14.9% 9.4% Other invested assets 4.4% 3.3% Cash 1.7% 1.8% Total investments and cash 100.0% 100.0% December 31, 2007 2006 Fixed income portfolio duration 3.9 years 4.1 years Fixed income composite credit quality Aa2 Aa2 Imbedded end of period yield, pre-tax 4.7% 4.6% Imbedded end of period yield, after-tax 3.9% 4.0% The classification shift for our equity securities reflects the adoption of FAS 159 effective January 1, 2007. The following table provides a comparison of our total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated: 2007 2006 2005 Fixed income portfolio total return 5.0% 4.6% 3.2% Lehman bond aggregate index 7.0% 4.3% 2.4% Common equity portfolio total return 9.2% 19.2% 13.8% S & P 500 index 5.5% 15.8% 4.9% Other invested asset portfolio total return 13.5% 19.8% 7.2% Reinsurance Receivables. Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $666.2 million at December 21, 2007 and $772.8 million at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, $176.1 million, or 26.4%, was receivable from Transatlantic; $152.1 million, or 22.8%, was receivable from Founders, for which the Company has established a $151.4 million provision for uncollectible reinsurance; $100.0 million, or 15.0%, was receivable from Continental; $54.6 million, or 8.2%, was receivable from Munich Re; $45.4 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from LM; $38.5 million, or 5.8%, was receivable from Ace and $37.7 million, or 5.7%, was receivable from Berkley. The receivable from Continental is collateralized by a funds held arrangements under which we have retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of our receivables. Loss and LAE Reserves. Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $9,040.6 million at December 31, 2007 and $8,840.1 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in our asbestos reserves, partially offset by favorable reserve development and the payout during 2007 of catastrophe reserves held as of December 31, 2006. 73 The following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, classified by case reserves and IBNR reserves, for the periods indicated: Gross Reserves By Segment At December 31, 2007 Case IBNR Total % of (Dollars in millions) Reserves Reserves Reserves Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,414.2 $ 1,907.0 $ 3,321.2 36.8% U.S. Insurance 597.5 1,083.7 1,681.2 18.6% Specialty Underwriting 273.2 161.3 434.5 4.8% International 632.0 472.8 1,104.8 12.2% Bermuda 753.1 823.0 1,576.1 17.4% Total excluding A&E 3,670.0 4,447.8 8,117.8 89.8% A&E 439.8 483.0 922.8 10.2% Total including A&E $ 4,109.8 $ 4,930.8 $ 9,040.6 100.0% At December 31, 2006 Case IBNR Total % of (Dollars in millions) Reserves Reserves Reserves Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,641.7 $ 2,061.7 $ 3,703.4 41.9% U.S. Insurance 591.4 1,011.0 1,602.4 18.1% Specialty Underwriting 338.7 145.6 484.4 5.5% International 535.1 380.2 915.3 10.3% Bermuda 817.5 667.0 1,484.5 16.8% Total excluding A&E 3,924.4 4,265.6 8,190.0 92.6% A&E 501.4 148.7 650.1 7.4% Total including A&E $ 4,425.8 $ 4,414.3 $ 8,840.1 100.0% (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Changes in earned premiums and business mix, reserve re-estimations, catastrophe losses and changes in catastrophe loss reserves and claim settlement activity all impact loss and LAE reserves by segment and in total. The increase in the December 31, 2007 reserves for A&E reflects the impact of a re-evaluation reserve analysis undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2007 in response to changes we observed in the reported loss trends on these reserves. Our loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We continuously re-evaluate our reserves, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. Changes in reserves resulting from such re-evaluations are reflected in incurred losses in the period when the re-evaluation is made. Our analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. In order to set appropriate reserves, we make qualitative and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels. Additionally, the attribution of reserves, changes in reserves and incurred losses among accident years requires qualitative and quantitative adjustments and allocations at these various levels. We utilize actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to assure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices. Nevertheless, our reserves are estimates, which are subject to variation, which may be significant. There can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future, possibly by a material amount. However, we believe that our existing reserves and reserving methodologies 74 lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context, we note that over the past 10 years, our past calendar year operations have been affected variably by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, with such effects ranging from a favorable $26.4 million in 2005, representing 0.5% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million in 2004, representing 3.7% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. We have noted that variability had increased for years 2002 to 2004 and we have taken actions to attempt to reduce year to year variability prospectively. We have included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries, which have been developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. Our presentation of this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. Our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point estimates for approximately 200 reserve groups and reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities. Our actuarial methodologies develop point estimates rather than ranges and the ranges are developed subsequently based upon historical and prospective variability measures. The following table below represents the reserve levels and ranges for each of our business segments for the period indicated: Outstanding Reserves and Ranges By Segment (1) At December 31, 2007 As Low Low High High (Dollars in millions) Reported Range % (2) Range (2) Range % (2) Range (2) Gross Reserves By Segment U.S. Reinsurance $ 3,321.2 -12.1% $ 2,920.7 12.1% $ 3,721.7 U.S. Insurance 1,681.1 -15.2% 1,425.3 15.2% 1,936.9 Specialty Underwriting 434.5 -16.3% 363.4 16.3% 505.5 International 1,104.8 -10.5% 989.1 10.5% 1,220.5 Bermuda 1,576.2 -9.4% 1,428.4 9.4% 1,723.9 Total Gross Reserves (excluding A&E) 8,117.8 -9.3% 7,363.5 9.3% 8,872.0 A&E (All Segments) 922.8 -13.7% 796.4 13.7% 1,049.3 Total Gross Reserves $ 9,040.6 -9.1% 8,217.6 9.1% 9,863.6 _______________ (1) There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges. (2) Although totals are displayed for both the low and high range amounts, because of the statistical methods employed, the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments. Depending on the specific segment, the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges from minus 9.4% to minus 16.3% for the low range and from plus 9.4% to plus 16.3% for the high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the Specialty Underwriting segment. The size of the range is dependent upon the level of confidence associated with the outcome. Within each range, management best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimatederived by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. For the above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence level but notes that there can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary outside of these ranges. Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, 75 may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have exposure to insured A&E losses through our Mt. McKinley operation and reinsured A&E losses and through Everest Re. In each case, our management and analyses of our exposures take into account a number of features of our business that differentiate our exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures. Mt. McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the volume of its writings in 1978. These writings ceased in 1984, giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure, which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on the product liability coverage; policies issued in earlier decades were generally more likely to lack aggregate limits. The vast majority of Mt. McKinley A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with aggregate coverage limits. Mt. McKinley attachment points vary but generally are excess of millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of most of Mt. McKinley policies also offers insulation against non-product claims (for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate since each non-product claim is a separate loss; whereas for product claims, all claims related to a given product aggregate as one loss. Environmental claims arise under general liability coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies. Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures beginning in 1984 through contract exclusions. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many long established reinsurance companies. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re mainly wrote property business, which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience indicates that the majority of its exposure was on excess policies, similar to those directly written by Mt. McKinley. 76 Asbestos and Environmental Exposures. The following table summarizes incurred losses and outstanding loss reserves with respect to A&E reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods indicated: At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 650.1 $ 649.5 $ 728.3 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 70.8 87.9 110.2 Change in IBNR 334.2 25.5 (33.1) Total incurred losses and LAE 405.0 113.4 77.1 Paid losses (132.3) (112.7) (155.9) End of period reserves $ 922.8 $ 650.1 $ 649.5 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 511.4 $ 450.4 $ 506.7 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 69.9 81.6 102.3 Change in IBNR 317.6 25.0 (20.9) Total incurred losses and LAE 387.5 106.6 81.4 Paid losses (71.6) (45.5) (137.7) End of period reserves $ 827.4 $ 511.4 $ 450.4 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding) At December 31, 2007, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $144.5 million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $147.1 million representing additional case reserves established by us on assumed reinsurance claims, $148.2 million representing case reserves established by us on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley and $483.0 million representing IBNR reserves. Asbestos reserves represent 92.3% of the outstanding net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2007 and represents a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve adequacy. 77 The following tables summarize reserve and claim activity on a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis for our reinsurance and direct asbestos exposures: Asbestos - Reinsurance At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 320.5 $ 313.4 $ 313.0 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 39.2 54.1 36.4 Change in IBNR 265.8 (2.7) 10.4 Total incurred losses and LAE 305.0 51.4 46.8 Paid losses (40.2) (44.3) (46.4) End of period reserves $ 585.3 $ 320.5 $ 313.4 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 302.0 $ 289.5 $ 276.6 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 40.4 50.9 35.6 Change in IBNR 255.6 3.6 17.4 Total incurred losses and LAE 296.0 54.5 53.0 Paid losses (40.6) (42.0) (40.1) End of period reserves $ 557.4 $ 302.0 $ 289.5 Asbestos - Direct At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 260.5 $ 255.5 $ 319.3 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 23.2 36.6 71.4 Change in IBNR 76.8 25.4 (41.2) Total incurred losses and LAE 100.0 62.0 30.2 Paid losses (86.9) (57.0) (94.0) End of period reserves $ 273.6 $ 260.5 $ 255.5 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 140.4 $ 75.8 $ 131.2 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 21.8 33.8 64.9 Change in IBNR 69.8 23.8 (36.5) Total incurred losses and LAE 91.6 57.6 28.4 Paid losses (26.1) 7.0 (83.8) End of period reserves $ 205.9 $ 140.4 $ 75.8 Ultimate loss projections for asbestos and environmental liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques. In response to our recent asbestos experience, and in view of industry asbestos experience, we completed a detailed study of our experience and our cedants exposures and also considered recent industry 78 trends. Our Claims Department undertook a contract by contract analysis of its direct business and projected those findings to its assumed reinsurance business. Our actuaries utilized nine methodologies to project our potential ultimate liabilities including projections based on internal data and assessments, extrapolations of non-public and publicly available data for our cedants and benchmarking against industry data and experience. As a result of this study and claims notifications and additional information received from cedants and insureds, we increased our gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by $250.0 million and increased our gross direct asbestos reserves by $75.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. This $325.0 million of gross reserve strengthening was the primary driver of the $405.0 million of gross incurred asbestos losses for the year ended December 31, 2007. Given our recent study and loss trends for these exposures, we believe our reserves at December 31, 2007 make adequate provisions for our asbestos losses. Nevertheless, given historical experience associated with asbestos claims, we cannot provide assurances that our current reserves are adequate and it is possible that our ultimate losses may exceed our estimate by a material amount. Industry analysts use the survival ratio to compare the A&E reserves among companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company current net reserves by the three year average of annual paid losses. Hence, the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels. Using this measurement, our net three year asbestos survival ratio was 8.2 years for reinsurance and direct business and 13.6 years for the reinsurance business at December 31, 2007. From a comparison perspective, A.M. Best published survival ratios as of December 31, 2006, the latest available information, of 8.9 years for the overall insurance industry and 9.5 years for the reinsurance sector. Because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and does not indicate absolute reserve adequacy, we consider, but do not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating our reserves. In particular, we note that year to year loss payment variability can be material. This is due, in part, to our orientation to negotiated settlements, particularly on our Mt. McKinley exposures, which significantly reduces the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2007, we made asbestos net claim payments of $57.3 million to Mt McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement had been reached. Such payments, which are non-repetitive, distort downward our three year survival ratio for 2007 and will continue to do so for 2008 and 2009. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing that total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, we consider that our adjusted asbestos survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 11.6 years, which is closer to prevailing industry norms. Shareholders Equity. Our shareholders equity increased to $5,684.8 million as of December 31, 2007 from $5,107.7 million as of December 31, 2006, principally due to $839.3 million of net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.5 million common shares for $241.6 million and $121.4 million of shareholder dividends. The Company shareholders equity increased to $5,107.7 million as of December 31, 2006 from $4,139.7 million as of December 31, 2005, principally reflecting $840.8 million of net income for 2006, a $54.1 million increase due to net currency translation, a $38.6 million increase in net share-based compensation activity and a $88.3 million increase in net unrealized appreciation on investments, partially offset by $39.0 million of shareholder dividends and an increase of $15.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income due to FAS 158 for pensions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital. Our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength, and the market perception of our strength, as measured by shareholders equity, which was $5,684.8 million and $5,107.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We possess significant financial flexibility and access to the debt and equity markets as a result of our perceived financial strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings 79 as assigned by independent rating agencies. We continuously monitor our capital and financial position, as well as investment and security market conditions and respond accordingly. From time to time, we have used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust our capital position. In September 2004, our authorization to purchase our shares was amended to authorize the repurchase of up to 5 million shares and during 2007, we repurchased 2.5 million shares under this authorization. We made no such purchases in 2006 or in 2005. Outside of our open market repurchase program, we repurchased 20,866 shares in 2007 and 21,384 shares in 2006 from employees in connection with restricted share vestings where individual employees chose to discharge withholding tax liabilities on vesting shares by the surrender of a portion of such shares. At December 31, 2007, there remained 2.5 million shares under the repurchase authorization. On December 1, 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as a Well Known Seasoned Issuer under the new registration and offering revisions to the Securities Act of 1933. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings is authorized to issue debt securities and Everest Re Capital Trust III ( Capital Trust III ) is authorized to issue trust preferred securities. On April 26, 2007, Holdings completed a public offering of $400.0 million principal amount of 6.6% fixed to floating rate long term subordinated notes with a scheduled maturity date of May 15, 2037 and a final maturity date of May 1, 2067. The net proceeds were used to redeem the 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities of Holdings on November 15, 2007, and for general corporate purposes. On December 1, 2005, we issued 2,298,000 of our common shares at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $236.4 million of proceeds before expenses and Holdings sold Group shares it acquired in 2002 at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $46.5 million of proceeds before expenses. Expenses incurred for this transaction were approximately $0.3 million. Liquidity. Our principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by our shareholders equity. For outstanding liabilities, we invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa, as rated by the independent investment rating service of Moody s. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by us. Over the past few years, we have reallocated our shareholders equity investment portfolio to include 1) publicly traded equity securities and 2) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes. We have limited our allocation to these asset classes because 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At December 31, 2007, the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated 38% of shareholders equity. Our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and 80 investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. Our net cash flows from operating activities were $854.4 million, $636.3 million and $1,070.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows reflected net tax payments of $282.6 million, $46.6 million and $110.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively; net catastrophe loss payments of $443.1 million, $896.5 million and $459.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively; and net A&E payments of $71.6 million, $45.5 million and $137.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net cash flows from operations in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to lower claim payments on catastrophes, partially offset by increased tax payments. Correspondingly, the decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes combined with lower premium volume. If disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses exceed premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash flow from investment maturities and dispositions, both short term investments and longer term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total cash flow. As the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 we held cash and short-term investments of $2,476.3 million and $1,556.4 million, respectively. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2007, we had $585.2 million, at fair value, of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $2,588.4 million maturing within one to five years and $6,942.7 million maturing after five years. Our $1,560.0 million of equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily liquidated. We believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future. We do not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but have the ability to do so. Sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses and we note that at December 31, 2007 we had $132.0 million of net pre-tax unrealized appreciation, comprised of $231.4 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation and $99.4 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation. Management expects the trend of positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing, to persist over the near term. In the intermediate and long term, the trend will be impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures affect overall pricing in our markets and the extent to which we successfully maintain our strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability. Effective July 27, 2007, Group, Bermuda Re and Everest International Reinsurance, Ltd. ( Everest International ) entered into a new five year, $850.0 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 8, 2004, senior credit facilities, which would have expired on December 8, 2007. Both the July 27, 2007 and December 8, 2004 senior credit facilities are referred to as the Group Credit Facility . Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility, which consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $350.0 million of revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of unsecured standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the Company option, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of (a) the prime commercial lending rate established by Wachovia Bank or (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depends on Group senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis. 81 The Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of $3,575.4 million plus 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group fiscal quarters, for which statements are available ending on or after January 1, 2007 and for which consolidated net income is positive, plus 25% of any increase in consolidated net worth during such period attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all Group Credit Facility covenants. At December 31, 2007, $22.0 million and $287.9 million were used under tranche one and tranche two of the Group Credit Facility, respectively. At December 31, 2006, $185.4 million was used under tranche two of the Group Credit Facility. Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings entered into a new five year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the October 10, 2003 three year senior revolving credit facility, which expired on October 10, 2006. Both the August 23, 2006 and October 10, 2003 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the Holdings Credit Facility . Citibank N.A. is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating interest rate per annum in effect from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank as its prime rate or 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings senior unsecured debt rating. The Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.5 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2007, Holdings was in compliance with all Holdings Credit Facility covenants. At December 31, 2007, $17.2 million was used under the Holdings Credit Facility. At December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the Holdings Credit Facility. Interest expense and fees incurred in connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Exposure to Catastrophes. Like other insurance and reinsurance companies, we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates and across lines of business. We focus on potential losses that could result from any single event, or series of events as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe prone zones and applying historic damage factors, to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis. No single universal model is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of underwriting 82 exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for our licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units. The combination of techniques potentially adds to the imprecision of our estimates. Also, while most models have been updated to better incorporate factors that contributed to unprecedented industry storm losses in 2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and demand surge, catastrophe model projections are inherently imprecise. In addition, uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data. Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events. Projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the PML. We define PML as anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The PML will vary depending upon the severity of modeled simulated losses and the make-up of the in force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods , such as 100-year events and 250-year events . For example, a 100-year PML corresponds to the estimated loss from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period. Conversely, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated PML. It is important to notes that PMLs are estimates. Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a result, there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. From an enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure the Company may underwrite. The limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the Company financial resources and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses of the business being underwritten. As of January 1, 2008, management estimated that the projected economic loss from its largest 100-year event does not exceed $600 million or about 10% of shareholders equity. Economic loss is the gross PML reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate reinsurance. Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year return periods. This process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management decisions. Our catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. We believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane affecting the U.S. southeast coast, where we estimate we have a gross PML exposure of $888 million. See also table under Risk Management and Retrocession Arrangements . 83 If such a single catastrophe loss were to occur, management estimates that the economic loss to us would be approximately $564 million. The impact represents approximately 10% of our capital as of January 1, 2008. The estimate involves multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded. We may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations. Reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting our view of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance. For 2005, and through 2007, we have not purchased corporate retrocessional protection and have generally de-emphasized the purchase of specific reinsurance by our underwriters, reflecting our view that our exposures, in the context of our capital, financial position and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels. See ITEM 1, Business - Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements for further details. Contractual Obligations. The following table shows our contractual obligations for the period indicated: Payments due by period Less than More than (Dollars in millions) Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years 8.75% Senior notes $ 200.0 $ - $ 200.0 $ - $ - 5.40% Senior notes 250.0 - - - 250.0 Junior subordinated debt 329.9 - - - 329.9 6.6% Long term notes 400.0 - - - 400.0 Interest expense (1) 2,243.0 77.2 145.7 119.5 1,900.6 Employee benefit plans 2.4 2.4 - - - Operating lease agreements 32.0 8.5 16.3 3.7 3.5 Gross reserve for losses and LAE (2) 9,040.6 2,053.2 3,232.3 1,077.1 2,678.1 Total $ 12,497.9 $ 2,141.3 $ 3,594.3 $ 1,200.3 $ 5,562.0 (1) Interest expense on 6.6% long term notes is assumed to be fixed through contractual term. (2) Loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of losses from claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash flows uncertain. Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ from our estimates. The contractual obligations for senior notes, long term notes and junior subordinated debt are the responsibility of Holdings. We have sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations. Holdings generally depends upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary for its funding, capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets. Our various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that we, and each of our entities, have sufficient financial resources or ready access thereto, to meet all obligations. Dividends. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we declared and paid shareholder dividends of $121.4 million, $39.0 million and $25.4 million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, we are partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. 84 Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest Re ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings general corporate needs and that Holdings and Bermuda Re will have the ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group general corporate needs. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $245.0 million, $100.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $0.0 million, $60.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively. See ITEM 1, Business Regulatory Matters Dividends and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of New Accounting Standards. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments ( FAS 115-1 ), which is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. FAS 115-1 addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FAS 115-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses not recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The Company adopted FAS 115-1 prospectively effective January 1, 2006. The Company believes that all unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are temporary in nature. In July 2006, FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ( FAS 109 ). FIN 48 prescribes the recognition and measurement criteria for the financial statements for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Further, FIN 48 expands the required disclosures associated with uncertain tax positions. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and no adjustment to beginning retained earnings. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early application encouraged. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value consistently in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company adopted FAS 157 as of January 1, 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans ( FAS 158 ), which is effective for employers with publicly traded equity securities as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. FAS 158 requires an employer to (a) recognize in its financial statements an asset for a plan over funded status or a liability for a plan under funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur as other comprehensive income. The Company adopted FAS 158 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2006. In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115 ( FAS 159 ), which is effective for employers with publicly traded equity securities as of the end of the fiscal year ending after November 15, 2007. FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The Company adopted FAS 159 as of January 1, 2007. 85 Market Sensitive Instruments. The SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). We do not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. Our current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, we invest in equity securities, which we believe will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio. We have also written a small number of equity index put options. The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period. Interest Rate Risk. Our $14.9 billion investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and of which 19.6%, are subject to foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations. The impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, from a change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $1,627.2 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $10,245.6 million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security. The tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including $2,225.7 million of short-term investments) for the periods indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At December 31, 2007 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Market Value $ 13,471.3 $ 12,981.6 $ 12,471.3 $ 11,900.2 $ 11,322.5 Market Value Change from Base (%) 8.0 % 4.1 % 0.0 % -4.6 % -9.2 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 750.4 $ 382.2 $ - $ (423.3) $ (849.7) 86 Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At December 31, 2006 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Market Value $ 12,621.7 $ 12,124.6 $ 11,626.3 $ 11,085.3 $ 10,521.7 Market Value Change from Base (%) 8.6 % 4.3 % 0.0 % -4.7 % -9.5 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 747.8 $ 374.7 $ - $ (403.5) $ (820.6) We had $9,040.6 million and $8,840.1 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to fair value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the fair value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the fair value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the fair value increases. These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments. While the difference between fair value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. Our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 3.8 years, which is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio. If we were to discount our loss and LAE reserves, net of $666.2 million of reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses, the discount would be approximately $1.6 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately $6.7 billion, representing approximately 54% of the market value of the fixed maturity investment portfolio funds. Equity Risk. Equity risk is the potential change in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing equity prices. Our equity investments consist of a diversified portfolio of individual securities and exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges. The primary objective of the equity portfolio is to obtain greater total return relative to bonds over time through market appreciation and income. The tables below display the impact on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 10% and 20% change in equity prices up and down for the periods indicated. Change in Equity Values in Percent At December 31, 2007 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 1,248.0 $ 1,404.0 $ 1,560.0 $ 1,716.0 $ 1,871.9 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (244.5) $ (122.3) $ - $ 122.3 $ 244.5 Change in Equity Values in Percent At December 31, 2006 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 1,290.9 $ 1,452.3 $ 1,613.7 $ 1,775.0 $ 1,936.4 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (239.5) $ (119.7) $ - $ 119.7 $ 239.5 Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of our non-U.S./Bermuda ( foreign ) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Generally, we prefer to maintain the capital of our operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this 87 varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation , we translate the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2007 there has been no material change in exposure to foreign exchange rates as compared to December 31, 2006. The tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure for the periods indicated. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent At December 31, 2007 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (90.6) $ (56.9) $ - $ 73.7 $ 160.0 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent At December 31, 2006 (Dollars in millions) -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (92.3) $ (54.6) $ - $ 66.8 $ 142.9 Although not considered material in the context of our aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, we have issued six equity index put options based on the S&P 500 index and one equity index put option based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure. We sold six equity index put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $22.5 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike prices on the exercise dates, which fall between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2007 index value, we estimate the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 5.4%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. The present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a 6% discount factor is $226.0 million. We sold one equity index put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7 million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of 5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2007 index value, we estimate the probability that the FTSE 100 index contract will fall below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 9.7%. The theoretical 88 maximum payout under the contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. The present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor is $31.5 million. Because the equity index put options meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133, we report the fair value of these instruments in our balance sheet and record any changes to fair value in our statement of operations. We have recorded fair values for our obligations on these equity put options at December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $39.7 million and $37.5 million, respectively; however, we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all. As there is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return. The tables below estimate the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the equity indices, which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value for the periods indicated. These are estimates and there can be no assurance regarding future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and S&P 500 and FTSE 100 indices shift reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it can increase to its theoretical maximum.
