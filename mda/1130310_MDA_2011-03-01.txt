Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes the city of Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states. Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. Business Segments In this Management Discussion, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation- related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2010 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving approximately 2.1 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately 5.9 million people and includes the city of Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout CenterPoint Houston certificated service territory. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers, river authorities and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (T exas Utility Commission). Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.3 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. 39 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated retail and wholesale natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in 23 states in the central and eastern regions of the United States. Interstate Pipelines CERC interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 8,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59 Bcf. It also owns a 50% interest in Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH). SESH owns a 1.0 Bcf per day, 274-mile interstate pipeline that runs from the Perryville Hub in Louisiana to Coden, Alabama. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. Field Services CERC field services business owns and operates approximately 3,800 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas primarily from three regions located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns a 50% general partnership interest in Waskom Gas Processing Company (Waskom). Waskom owns a natural gas processing plant and natural gas gathering assets located in East Texas. The plant is capable of processing approximately 285 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of natural gas. The gathering assets are capable of gathering approximately 75 MMcf per day of natural gas. Other Operations Our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Factors Influencing Our Business We are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the gathering, processing, transportation and sale of natural gas and the transportation and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries. We do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end-use electric customers. To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our five business segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, operation and maintenance expense, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per cust omer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. We also monitor system reliability, safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance. To the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. Reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Performance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer. Weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage, and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis. During 2009 and continuing into 2010, we saw evidence that customers are seeking to reduce their energy consumption, particularly during periods of high energy prices or in times of economic distress. That conservation can have adverse effects on our results. In many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and in Minnesota, we have benefited from customer growth that tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption. We anticipate that this growth will continue despite recent economic d ownturns, though that growth may be lower than we have recently experienced in 40 these areas. In addition, the profitability of these businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates. In recent rate filings, we have sought rate mechanisms that help to decouple our results from the impacts of weather and conservation, but such rate mechanisms have not yet been approved in all jurisdictions. We plan to continue to pursue such decoupling mechanisms in our rate filings. Our Field Services and Interstate Pipelines business segments are currently benefiting from their proximity to new natural gas producing regions in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Our Interstate Pipelines business segment benefited from new projects placed into service in 2009 on our Carthage to Perryville line, including a backhaul agreement due to expire in 2011. In our Field Services business segment, strong shale drilling activity has helped offset declines in traditional drilling activity. In monitoring performance of the segments, we focus on throughput of the pipelines and gathering systems, and in the case of Field Services, on well-connects. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis. Its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the United States. The segment benefits from favorable price differentials, either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis. While it utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements, it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level, or VaR, to avoid significant financial exposures. Lower commodity prices and low price differentials during 2009 and 2010 adversely affected results for this business segment. The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. Our goal is to improve our credit ratings over time. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets, such as occurred in the last half of 2008 and continued during 2009, can also affect the availabi lity of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. For example, we have amended the financial covenant in our revolving credit facility to enhance our ability to incur additional debt if needed to finance restoration costs following major storms. As it did with many businesses, the sharp decline in stock market values during the latter part of 2008 had a significant adverse impact on the value of our pension plan assets. While that impact did not require us to make additional contributions to the pension plan, it significantly increased the pension expense we recognized during 2009. We expect to make a minimum required contribution to our pension plan of $35 million in 2011 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years. Consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs, we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. Significant Events Long-Term Gas Gathering and Treating Agreements Magnolia Gathering System. In September 2009, CenterPoint Energy Field Services, LLC (CEFS) entered into long-term agreements with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Encana Corporation (Encana) and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale formations in Louisiana. Pursuant to these agreements, CEFS acquired jointly-owned gathering facilities (the Magnolia Gathering System) from Encana and Shell in northwest Louisiana. Each of the agreements includes acreage dedication and volume commitments for which CEFS has exclusive rights to gather Shell and Encana natural gas production. 41 During the year ended December 31, 2010, CEFS substantially completed the construction and initial expansion of the Magnolia Gathering System in order to permit the system to gather and treat up to 700 MMcf per day of natural gas, with only well connects remaining. As of December 31, 2010, CEFS had spent approximately $310 million on the original project scope, including the purchase of the original facilities and is in the second year of the 10-year 700 MMcf per day volume commitment made by Shell and Encana. Pursuant to an expansion election made by Encana and Shell in March 2010, CEFS expanded the Magnolia Gathering System to increase its gathering and treating capacity by an additional 200 MMcf per day, increasing the aggregate capacity of the system to 900 MMcf per day. As of December 31, 2010, CEFS had spent approximately $47 million on the expansion. The expansion was completed and placed into service in February 2011 at a total cost of approximately $52 million. The 200 MMcf per day incremental 10-year volume commitment made by Shell and Encana began contemporaneously with the completion of the expansion. Under the long-term agreements, Encana or Shell may elect to require CEFS to expand the capacity of the Magnolia Gathering System by up to an additional 800 MMcf per day, bringing the total system capacity to 1.7 Bcf per day. CEFS estimates that the cost to expand the capacity of the Magnolia Gathering System by an additional 800 MMcf per day would be as much as $240 million. Encana and Shell would provide incremental volume commitments in connection with an election to expand the system capacity. Olympia Gathering System. In April 2010, CEFS entered into additional long-term agreements with Encana and Shell to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale formations in Texas and Louisiana. Pursuant to these agreements, CEFS acquired jointly-owned gathering facilities (the Olympia Gathering System) from Encana and Shell in northwest Louisiana. Under the terms of the agreements, CEFS is expanding the Olympia Gathering System in order to permit the system to gather and treat up to 600 MMcf per day of natural gas. As of December 31, 2010, CEFS had spent approximately $340 million on the 600 MMcf per day project, including the purchase of the original facilities, and expects to incur up to an additional $85 million to complete this expansion. CEFS expects the full 600 MMcf per day of capacity to be in service in the first quarter of 2011. CEFS is in the first year of the 10-year 600 MMcf per day volume commitment made by Shell and Encana. Under the long-term agreements, Encana and Shell may elect to require CEFS to expand the capacity of the Olympia Gathering System by up to an additional 520 MMcf per day, bringing the total system capacity to 1.1 Bcf per day. CEFS estimates that the cost to expand the capacity of the Olympia Gathering System by an additional 520 MMcf per day would be as much as $200 million. Encana and Shell would provide incremental volume commitments in connection with an election to expand the system capacity. Advanced Metering System and Distribution Grid Automation (Intelligent Grid) In October 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) notified CenterPoint Houston that it had been selected for a $200 million grant for its advanced metering system (AMS) and intelligent grid (IG) projects. In March 2010, CenterPoint Houston and the DOE completed negotiations and finalized the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the DOE has agreed to reimburse CenterPoint Houston for 50% of its eligible costs until the total amount of the grant has been paid. Through December 31, 2010, CenterPoint Houston has requested $100 million of grant funding from the DOE, of which $90 million had been received. CenterPoint Houston estimates that capital expenditures of approximately $645 million for the installation o f the advanced meters and corresponding communication and data management systems will be incurred over the deployment period. CenterPoint Houston is using $150 million of the grant funding to accelerate completion of its current deployment of advanced meters to 2012, instead of 2014 as originally scheduled. CenterPoint Houston will use the other $50 million from the grant to begin deployment of an IG in a portion of its service territory over the next three years. It is expected that the portion of the IG project subject to funding by the DOE will cost approximately $115 million. CenterPoint Houston believes the IG has the potential to provide an improvement in grid planning, operations, maintenance and customer service for its distribution system. In March 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced through the issuance of Revenue Procedure 2010-20 that it was providing a safe harbor to corporations that receive a Smart Grid Investment Grant. The IRS stated 42 that it would not challenge a corporation treatment of the grant as a non-taxable non-shareholder contribution to capital as long as the corporation properly reduced the tax basis of specified property acquired. CenterPoint Houston Rate Case As required under the final order in its 2006 rate proceeding, in June 2010 CenterPoint Houston filed an application to change rates with the Texas Utility Commission and the cities in its service area, including cost data and other information supporting an annual increase of $106 million for delivery charges to the REPs that sell electricity to end-use customers in CenterPoint Houston service territory that was offset by a reduction of other utility revenues, resulting in a $92 million requested annual revenue increase. The rate filing package also supported an annual increase of $18 million for wholesale transmission customers. In the filing, CenterPoint Houston also requested reconciliation of its AMS costs incurred as of March 31, 2010, and revision of the estimated costs to complete the AMS project in order to reflect $150 million in funds from the $200 million DOE stimulus grant awarded to CenterPoint Houston and updated cost information. The reconciliation plan also requested that the duration of the residential AMS surcharge be shortened by six years from the original 12-year plan. In its rate filing, CenterPoint Houston sought a return on equity of 11.25% and proposed that rates be based on a capital structure of 50% equity and 50% long-term debt. Hearings concerning the rate filing concluded in October 2010, and a Proposal for Decision was issued by the presiding Administrative Law Judges. On February 3, 2011 the Texas Utility Commission voted on the various contested issues presented by the rate filing. The Texas Utility Commission has not yet issued a formal order implementing its decisions, and the order, once issued, will be subject to revision based on motions for rehearing by the parties to the proceeding and could be appealed to the Texas courts. Based on the public deliberations and votes by the Commissioners, CenterPoint Houston anticipates that the order of the Texas Utility Commission will provide for a base rate increase for CenterPoint Houston of approximately $14.7 million per year for delivery charges to the REPs and a decrease to charges to wholesale transmission customers of $12.3 million per year. Further, the order is expected to provide a mechanism to track amounts for uncertain tax positions and provide for ultimate recovery of those costs. The order is expected to be based on an authorized return on equity for CenterPoint Houston of 10%, a cost of debt of 6.74 %, a capital structure comprised of 55% debt and 45% common equity, and an overall rate of return of 8.21%. The decision also will implement CenterPoint Houston request to reconcile costs incurred for the AMS project and to shorten the period for collecting the AMS surcharge from twelve to six years for residential customers in order to reflect the funds received from the DOE. Based on CenterPoint Houston understanding of the Texas Utility Commission votes, CenterPoint Houston anticipates that annual operating income will be reduced by approximately $30 million from 2010 levels as a result of the Texas Utility Commission decision. CenterPoint Houston expects that revised rates based on the Texas Utility Commission decision will be implemented during the second quarter of 2011. Debt Financing Transactions In January 2010, we purchased $290 million principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 5.125%. The purchase reduced temporary investments and leverage while providing us with the flexibility to finance future capital needs in the tax-exempt market through a remarketing of these bonds. In January 2010, CERC Corp. redeemed $45 million of its outstanding 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In September 2010, we repaid $200 million principal amount of 7.25% senior notes on their maturity date. 43 In January 2011, CERC Corp. issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021 with an interest rate of 4.50% and $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2041 with an interest rate of 5.85%. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for the repayment of $550 million of CERC Corp. 7.75% senior notes at their maturity in February 2011. Also in January 2011, CERC Corp. issued an additional $343 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2021 and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for $397 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% senior notes due 2013. The premium of $58 million paid on exchanged notes has been deferred and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 4.50% senior notes due 2021. Equity Financing Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received net proceeds of approximately $315 million from the issuance of 25.3 million common shares in an underwritten public offering, proceeds of approximately $79 million from the sale of approximately 5.4 million common shares to our defined contribution plan and proceeds of approximately $15 million from the sale of approximately 1.0 million common shares to participants in our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. In January 2011, we suspended the issuance of common shares to our defined contribution plan and our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. Common shares for the two plans are now being purchased on the open market. Financial Reform Legislation On July 21, 2010 the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which makes substantial changes to regulatory oversight regarding banks and financial institutions. Many provisions of Dodd-Frank will also affect non-financial businesses such as those conducted by us and our subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impacts this legislation may have on us and our subsidiaries since most of the provisions in the law will require extensive rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and authorities, including, among others, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Nevertheless, in a number of areas, the resulting rules are expected to have direct or i ndirect impacts on our businesses. Dodd-Frank provisions will increase required disclosures regarding executive compensation, and rules adopted by the SEC in January 2011 require an advisory vote by shareholders on executive compensation ("say-on-pay") and require an advisory vote by shareholders on the frequency that such say-on-pay votes will be submitted in future years at our 2011 annual meeting. New rules adopted by the SEC, which would not apply to us until 2012, are intended to provide shareholders with access to the director nomination process, but those rules have been stayed by the SEC in light of pending legal challenges. Although Dodd-Frank includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives, the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted by the SEC and the CFTC. The SEC is charged with adopting new regulations regarding securitization transactions such as the asset-backed securitizations CenterPoint Houston has sponsored for recovery of transition and storm restoration costs. Dodd-Frank also includes new whistleblower provisions. Dodd-Frank also makes substantial changes to the regulatory oversight of the credit rating agencies that are typically engaged to rate our securities and those of our subsidiaries. It is presently unknown what effect implementation of these new provisions ultimately will have on the activities or costs associated with the credit rating process. 44 CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: the resolution of the true-up proceedings, including, in particular, the results of appeals to the Texas Supreme Court regarding rulings obtained to date; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments relating to the environment, including those related to global climate change; other state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments affecting various aspects of our business, including, among others, energy deregulation or re-regulation, pipeline safety, health care reform, financial reform and tax legislation; timely and appropriate rate actions and increases, allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; the timing and outcome of any audits, disputes and other proceedings related to taxes; problems with construction, implementation of necessary technology or other issues with respect to major capital projects that result in delays or in cost overruns that cannot be recouped in rates; industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand, including the effects of energy efficiency measures and demographic patterns; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas and natural gas liquids, and the effects of geographic and seasonal commodity price differentials; the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas, including supplies available for gathering by our field services business and transporting by our interstate pipelines; weather variations and other natural phenomena; the impact of unplanned facility outages; timely and appropriate regulatory actions allowing securitization or other recovery of costs associated with any future hurricanes or natural disasters; changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; actions by rating agencies; effectiveness of our risk management activities; inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers; the ability of GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn) (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc.) and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations to us, including indemnity obligations, or in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor; the ability of REPs, including REP subsidiaries of NRG Retail LLC and REP subsidiaries of TXU Energy Retail Company LLC, which are CenterPoint Houston two largest customers, to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries; 45 the outcome of litigation brought by or against us; our ability to control costs; the investment performance of our pension and postretirement benefit plans; our potential business strategies, including restructurings, acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which we cannot assure will be completed or will have the anticipated benefits to us; acquisition and merger activities involving us or our competitors; and other factors we discuss under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Revenues $ 11,322 $ 8,281 $ 8,785 Expenses 10,049 7,157 7,536 Operating Income 1,273 1,124 1,249 Gain (Loss) on Marketable Securities (139 ) 82 67 Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities 128 (68 ) (31 ) Interest and Other Finance Charges (468 ) (513 ) (481 ) Interest on Transition and System Restoration Bonds (136 ) (131 ) (140 ) Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 51 15 29 Other Income, net 14 39 12 Income Before Income Taxes 723 548 705 Income Tax Expense (277 ) (176 ) (263 ) Net Income $ 446 $ 372 $ 442 Basic Earnings Per Share $ 1.32 $ 1.02 $ 1.08 Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.30 $ 1.01 $ 1.07 2010 Compared to 2009 Net Income. We reported net income of $442 million ($1.07 per diluted share) for 2010 compared to $372 million ($1.01 per diluted share) for the same period in 2009. The increase in net income of $70 million was primarily due to a $125 million increase in operating income, a $37 million decrease in the loss on our indexed debt securities, a $32 million decrease in interest expense due to lower levels of debt, excluding transition and system restoration bond-related interest expense, and a $14 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, which were partially offset by an $87 million increase in income tax expense, a $27 million decrease in Other Income, net primarily due to the $23 mill ion of carrying costs related to Hurricane Ike restoration costs in 2009, a $15 million decrease in the gain on our marketable securities and a $9 million increase in interest expense on transition and system restoration bonds. Income Tax Expense. Our 2010 effective tax rate of 37.3% differed from the 2009 effective tax rate of 32.1% primarily due to the settlement in 2009 of our federal income tax return examinations for tax years 2004 and 2005 and a reduction in state income taxes in 2009 related to adjustments in prior years state estimates. The 2010 effective tax rate included the effects of remeasuring accumulated deferred income taxes associated with the restructuring of certain subsidiaries in December 2010 (decrease in income tax expense of $24 million) as well as a change in tax law upon the enactment in March 2010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related Health Care and Education R econciliation Act of 2010 (increase in income tax expense of $21 million). In 46 combination, these 2010 events did not have a material impact on our 2010 effective tax rate. For more information, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. 2009 Compared to 2008 Net Income. We reported net income of $372 million ($1.01 per diluted share) for 2009 compared to $446 million ($1.30 per diluted share) for the same period in 2008. The decrease in net income of $74 million was primarily due to a $149 million decrease in operating income, a $45 million increase in interest expense due primarily to higher interest rates and higher levels of debt during 2009, excluding transition and system restoration bond-related interest expense, a $36 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and a $196 million decrease in the gain on our indexed debt securities. These decreases in net income were partially offset by a $101 million decrease in income tax expense, a $221 million increase in the gain on our marketable securities, $23 million of carrying costs related to Hurricane Ike restoration costs included in Other Income, net and a $5 million decrease in interest expense on transition and system restoration bonds. Income Tax Expense. Our 2009 effective tax rate of 32.1% differed from the 2008 effective tax rate of 38.4% primarily due to the settlement in 2009 of our federal income tax return examinations for tax years 2004 and 2005 and a reduction in state income taxes in 2009 related to adjustments in prior years state estimates. For more information, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2008, 2009 and 2010. Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $567 million for 2010, consisting of $427 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $140 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2009, operating income totaled $545 million, consisting of $414 million from the TDU and $131 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. TDU revenues increased $95 million primarily due to increased revenues from implementation of AMS ($34 million), increased usage ($30 million), in part caused by favorable weather, higher transmission-related revenues ($26 million) and higher revenues due to customer growth ($20 million) from the addition of nearly 28,000 new customers, partially offset by a customer credit related to deferred income taxes associated with Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs ($21 million). Operation and maintenance expenses increased $67 million primarily due to higher transmission costs billed by transmission providers ($28 million), increased AMS project expenses ($11 million), increased labor costs ($10 million), increased contracts and services ($10 million) and increased environmental remediation costs ($7 million). Increased depreciation expense is related to increased investment in AMS ($19 million). 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $545 million for 2009, consisting of $414 million from the TDU and $131 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2008, operating income totaled $545 million, consisting of $407 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $5 million from the competition transition charge, and $133 million related to transition bond companies. Revenues for the TDU increased due to higher transmission-related revenues ($50 million), in part reflecting the impact of a transmission rate increase implemented in November 2008, the impact of Hurricane Ike in 2008 ($17 million), revenues from implemen tation of AMS ($33 million) and higher revenues due to customer growth ($17 million) from the addition of over 29,000 new customers, partially offset by declines in energy demand ($27 million). Operation and maintenance expenses increased $71 million primarily due 48 to higher transmission costs billed by transmission providers ($18 million), increased operating and maintenance expenses that were postponed in 2008 as a result of Hurricane Ike restoration efforts ($10 million), higher pension and other employee benefit costs ($10 million), expenses related to AMS ($14 million) and a gain on a land sale in 2008 ($9 million). Increased depreciation expense related to increased investment in AMS ($7 million) was offset by other declines in depreciation and amortization, primarily due to asset retirements. Taxes other than income taxes increased $7 million primarily as a result of a refund in 2008 of prior years state franchise taxes ($5 million). Changes in pension expense over our 2007 base year amount were deferred and included in our 2010 rate filing pursuant to Texas law. Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Revenues $ 4,226 $ 3,384 $ 3,213 Expenses: Natural gas 3,124 2,251 2,049 Operation and maintenance 589 639 639 Depreciation and amortization 157 161 166 Taxes other than income taxes 141 129 128 Total expenses 4,011 3,180 2,982 Operating Income $ 215 $ 204 $ 231 Throughput (in Bcf): Residential 175 173 177 Commercial and industrial 236 233 249 Total Throughput 411 406 426 Number of customers at end of period: Residential 2,987,222 3,002,114 3,016,333 Commercial and industrial 248,476 244,101 246,891 Total 3,235,698 3,246,215 3,263,224 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $231 million for 2010 compared to $204 million for 2009. Operating income increased $27 million primarily as a result of revenue from base rate increases and annual rate adjustments ($24 million), lower pension and other benefits costs ($14 million), customer growth, higher throughput and increased other revenues ($8 million) and lower bad debt expense ($5 million). These were partially offset by higher labor costs ($7 million), higher contracts and services ($5 million) and other expenses ($7 million). Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5 million primarily due to higher plant balances. font> 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $204 million for 2009 compared to $215 million for 2008. Operating income declined ($11 million) primarily as a result of increased pension expense ($37 million) and higher labor and other benefit costs ($16 million), partially offset by increased revenues from rate increases ($36 million) and lower bad debt expense ($15 million). Revenues related to both energy-efficiency costs and gross receipts taxes are substantially offset by the related expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4 million primarily due to higher plant balances. Taxes other than income taxes, net of the decrease in gross receipts taxe ($16 million), increased $4 million also primarily due to higher plant balances. 49 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Revenues $ 4,528 $ 2,230 $ 2,651 Expenses: Natural gas 4,423 2,165 2,591 Operation and maintenance 39 39 38 Depreciation and amortization 3 4 4 Taxes other than income taxes 1 1 2 Total expenses 4,466 2,209 2,635 Operating Income $ 62 $ 21 $ 16 Throughput (in Bcf) 528 504 548 Number of customers at end of period 9,771 11,168 12,193 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $16 million for 2010 compared to $21 million for 2009. The decrease in operating income of $5 million was primarily due to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and decreased seasonal storage spreads of $32 million as compared to last year. Offsetting this decrease to operating income is an increase in operating income of $27 million related to the favorable impact of the mark-to-market valuation for non-trading financial derivatives for 2010 of $4 million versus the unfavorable impact of $23 million for 2009. Additionally, a $6 million write-down of natural gas inventory t o the lower of cost or market occurred in both 2009 and 2010. 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $21 million for 2009 compared to $62 million for 2008. The decrease in operating income of $41 million was due to the unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market valuation for non-trading financial derivatives for 2009 of $23 million versus a favorable impact of $13 million for the same period in 2008. A further $28 million decrease in margin is attributable to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and an absence of summer storage spreads. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by a $6 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market for 2009 compared to a $30 million write-down in the same period in 2008. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment purchases and stores natural gas to meet certain future sales requirements and enters into derivative contracts to hedge the economic value of the future sales. 50 Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Revenues $ 650 $ 598 $ 601 Expenses: Natural gas 155 97 93 Operation and maintenance 133 166 153 Depreciation and amortization 46 48 52 Taxes other than income taxes 23 31 33 Total expenses 357 342 331 Operating Income $ 293 $ 256 $ 270 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 36 $ 7 $ 19 Transportation throughput (in Bcf) 1,538 1,592 1,693 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $270 million for 2010 compared to $256 million for 2009. Margins (revenues less natural gas costs) increased by $7 million primarily due to new contracts for the Phase IV Carthage to Perryville pipeline expansion ($42 million) and new power plant transportation contracts ($4 million), partially offset by reduced ancillary services, off-system and other transportation margins ($39 million). Lower operation and maintenance expenses ($13 million) were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses ($4 million) related to new assets and increased taxes other than income taxes ($2 million). 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $256 million for 2009 compared to $293 million for 2008. Margins increased $6 million primarily due to the Carthage to Perryville pipeline ($28 million) and new contracts with power generation customers ($20 million), partially offset by reduced other transportation margins and ancillary services ($42 million) primarily due to the decline in commodity prices from the significantly higher levels in 2008. Operations and maintenance expenses increased due to a gain on the sale of two storage development projects in 2008 ($18 million) and costs associated with incremental facilities ($12 million) and increased pension expenses ($9 million). These expenses were partially offset by a write-down associated with pipeline assets removed from service in the third quarter of 2008 ($7 million). Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $2 million and taxes other than income taxes increased by $8 million, $2 million of which was due to 2008 tax refunds. Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $36 million, $7 million and $19 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, from its 50% interest in SESH, a jointly-owned pipeline. The 2008 year-end results include $33 million of pre-operating allowance for funds used during construction. The 2009 results include a non-cash pre-tax charge of $16 million to reflect SESH decision to discontinue the use of guidance for accounting for regulated operations, which was partially offset by the receipt of a one-time payment related to the construction of the pipeline and a reduction in estimated property taxes, of which our 50% share was $5 million. Excluding the effect of these adjustments , equity earnings from normal operations was $3 million and $18 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. These amounts are included in Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption in the Statements of Consolidated Income. 51 Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Revenues $ 252 $ 241 $ 338 Expenses: Natural gas 21 51 72 Operation and maintenance 69 77 85 Depreciation and amortization 12 15 25 Taxes other than income taxes 3 4 5 Total expenses 105 147 187 Operating Income $ 147 $ 94 $ 151 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 15 $ 8 $ 10 Gathering throughput (in Bcf) 421 426 650 2010 Compared to 2009. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $151 million for 2010 compared to $94 million for 2009. Margins (revenues less natural gas costs) increased primarily due to new projects, including the Magnolia and Olympia Gathering Systems in the North Louisiana Haynesville Shale and core gathering services ($74 million), along with increased commodity prices ($2 million). Increases in operating expenses ($29 million) and depreciation ($10 million) associated with new projects were partially offset by a gain on the sale of non-strategic gathering assets in October 2010 ($21 million). 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $94 million for 2009 compared to $147 million for 2008. Margins from new projects and core gathering services increased approximately $24 million for 2009 when compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to continued development in the shale plays. This increase was offset primarily by the effect of a decline in commodity prices of approximately $54 million from the significantly higher prices experienced in 2008. Operating income for 2009 also included higher costs associated with incremental facilities ($4 million) and increased pension cost ($2 million). Operating income for 2008 benefited from a one-time gain ($11 m illion) related to a settlement and contract buyout of one of our customers and a gain on sale of assets ($6 million). Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $15 million, $8 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, from its 50% interest in Waskom. The increase is driven primarily by assets acquired in the first quarter of 2010, higher natural gas liquid prices, partially offset by lower processing volumes. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption in the Statements of Consolidated Income. Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2008, 2009 and 2010 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Revenues $ 11 $ 11 $ 11 Expenses 7 (3 ) Operating Income $ 11 $ 4 $ 14 52 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flows The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2008, 2009 and 2010 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 851 $ 1,841 $ 1,386 Investing activities (1,368 ) (896 ) (1,420 ) Financing activities 555 (372 ) (507 ) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 decreased $455 million compared to 2009 primarily due to decreased cash related to gas storage inventory ($274 million), increased tax payments ($216 million) and increased net margin deposits ($109 million), which were partially offset by increased income ($70 million), increased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($21 million) and increased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ($14 million). Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 increased $990 million compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased cash used in net regulatory assets and liabilities primarily related to Hurricane Ike restoration costs in 2008 ($366 million), decreased cash used in net margin deposits ($298 million), decreased cash used in gas storage inventory ($246 million) and increased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($41 million). Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $524 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased capital expenditures ($349 million), primarily related to Field Services projects ($320 million), decreased cash from notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates ($323 million) and increased restricted cash of transition bond and system restoration companies ($31 million), which were partially offset by decreased investment in unconsolidated affiliates ($97 million) and cash received from the DOE grant ($90 million). Net cash used in investing activities decreased $472 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to decreased notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates ($498 million), decreased investment in unconsolidated affiliates ($91 million) and decreased restricted cash of transition bond companies ($37 million) offset by increased capital expenditures ($140 million) primarily related to our Field Services business segment. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 increased $135 million compared to 2009 primarily due to decreased proceeds from long-term debt ($1.2 billion), increased payments of long-term debt ($561 million), decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock ($88 million) and increased common stock dividend payments ($43 million), which were offset by decreased repayments of borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($1.4 billion), increased proceeds from commercial paper ($183 million) and increased short-term debt borrowings ($96 million). Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 increased $927 million compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($2.6 billion), and decreased short-term borrowings ($19 million), which were partially offset by decreased repayments of long-term debt ($1.2 billion), increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock ($424 million) and increased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt ($77 million). 53 Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2011 include the following: approximately $1.3 billion of capital expenditures; maturing long-term debt aggregating approximately $19 million, excluding $550 million aggregate principal amount of CERC Corp. debt that was retired at its maturity in February 2011 with proceeds from debt issued by CERC Corp. in January 2011; $283 million of scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds; and dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on debt. We expect that cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in 2011. Cash needs or discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2010 and estimates of our capital expenditures for 2011 through 2015 (in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Electric Transmission & Distribution (1) $ 463 $ 605 $ 468 $ 469 $ 506 $ 372 Natural Gas Distribution 202 263 274 285 285 285 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 2 10 12 12 6 6 Interstate Pipelines 102 157 133 131 119 95 Field Services 668 262 135 125 59 60 Other Operations 25 40 31 25 25 27 Total $ 1,462 $ 1,337 $ 1,053 $ 1,047 $ 1,000 $ 845 (1) Includes capital expenditures of $119 million in 2010 and estimated capital expenditures of $225 million, $64 million and $10 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, related to AMS and IG, net of a $200 million grant by the DOE. The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2011 2012-2013 2014-2015 2016 and thereafter Transition and system restoration bond debt $ 2,805 $ 283 $ 637 $ 484 $ 1,401 Other long-term debt(1) 7,303 19 1,044 1,380 4,860 Interest payments transition and system restoration bond debt(2) 699 129 217 162 191 Interest payments other long-term debt(2) 4,195 426 790 562 2,417 Short-term borrowings 53 53 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases(3) 59 15 19 10 15 Benefit obligations(4) Purchase obligations(5) 1 1 Non-trading derivative liabilities 85 69 16 Other commodity commitments(6) 2,393 502 933 505 453 Income taxes(7) Other 18 6 12 Total contractual cash obligations $ 17,612 $ 1,503 $ 3,668 $ 3,103 $ 9,338 54 (1) 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) obligations are included in the 2016 and thereafter column at their contingent principal amount payable in 2029 of $805 million. These obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS ($367 million at December 31, 2010), as discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Maturities in 2011 exclude $550 million of 7.75% senior notes of CERC Corp. and maturities in 2013 exclude $397 million of 7.875% senior notes of CERC Corp. discussed in Note 11(b) to our consolidated financial statements and below under Debt Financing Transactions. (2) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2010. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 13(c) to our consolidated financial statements. (4) We expect to make a minimum required contribution of $35 million in 2011 to our qualified pension plan. We expect to contribute approximately $9 million and $18 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2011. (5) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with our Interstate Pipelines business segment. (6) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 13(a) to our consolidated financial statements. (7) As of December 31, 2010, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $252 million. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which any such liabilities might be paid. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than the guaranties described below and operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation. Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December. The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $112 million as of December 31, 2010. Market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2010 required posting of security under the agreement, and GenOn posted approximately $7 million in collateral in December 2010. If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC obligations. In May 2009, RRI sold its Texas retail business to NRG Retail, a subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. In December 2010, Mirant Corporation merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of RRI and RRI changed its name from RRI Energy, Inc. to GenOn Energy, Inc. Neither the sale of the retail business nor the merger with Mirant Corporation alters GenOn contractual obligations to indemnify us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, for certain liabilities, including their indemnification obligations regarding certain litigation, nor does it affect the terms of existing guaranty arrangements for certain GenOn gas transportation contracts. 55 Debt Financing Transactions . In January 2010, we purchased $290 million principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 5.125%. The purchase reduced temporary investments and leverage while providing us with the flexibility to finance future capital needs in the tax-exempt market through a remarketing of these bonds. In January 2010, CERC Corp. redeemed $45 million of its outstanding 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In September 2010, we repaid $200 million principal amount of 7.25% senior notes on their maturity date. In January 2011, CERC Corp. issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2021 with an interest rate of 4.50% and $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2041 with an interest rate of 5.85%. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for the repayment of $550 million of CERC Corp. 7.75% senior notes at their maturity in February 2011. Also in January 2011, CERC Corp. issued an additional $343 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2021 and provided cash consideration of $114 million in exchange for $397 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% senior notes due 2013. The premium of $58 million paid on exchanged notes has been deferred and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 4.50% senior notes due 2021. Equity Financing Transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received net proceeds of approximately $315 million from the issuance of 25.3 million common shares in an underwritten public offering, proceeds of approximately $79 million from the sale of approximately 5.4 million common shares to our defined contribution plan and proceeds of approximately $15 million from the sale of approximately 1.0 million common shares to participants in our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. In January 2011, we suspended the issuance of common shares to our defined contribution plan and our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. Common shares for the two plans are now being purchased on the open market. Credit and Receivables Facilities. In September 2010, CERC amended its 364-day receivables facility to extend the termination date to September 14, 2011. Availability under CERC receivables facility ranges from $160 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, the facility size was $150 million and $160 million, respectively. As of both December 31, 2009 and 2010, there were no advances under the receivables facility. As of February 15, 2011, we had the following facilities (in millions): Date Executed Company Type of Facility Size of Facility Amount Utilized at February 15, 2011 (1) Termination Date June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Energy Revolver $ 1,156 $ 20 (2) June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Houston Revolver 289 4 (2) June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CERC Corp. Revolver 915 248 (3) June 29, 2012 September 15, 2010 CERC Receivables 375 September 14, 2011 (1) Based on the debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant contained in our $1.2 billion credit facility, we would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of our credit facilities of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2010. Amounts advanced under CERC receivables facility are not treated as outstanding indebtedness in the debt to EBITDA covenant calculation. (2) Represents outstanding letters of credit. (3) Represents commercial paper that is backstopped by CERC Corp. revolving credit facility. 56 Our $1.2 billion credit facility has a first drawn cost of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 55 basis points based on our current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to EBITDA covenant (as those terms are defined in the facility). In February 2010, we amended our credit facility to modify the covenant to allow for a temporary increase of the permitted ratio from 5 times to 5.5 times if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that CenterPoint Houston has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a calendar year, all or part of which CenterPoint Houston intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial ratio covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of our certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to total capitalization covenant, limiting debt to 65% of its total capitalization. The facility first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings. CERC Corp. $915 million credit facility first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt to total capitalization covenant, limiting debt to 65% of its total capitalization. Under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp $915 million credit facility, an additional utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee fluctuate based on the borrower credit rating. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. consider customary. We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants contained in the respective credit facilities as disclosed above. Our $1.2 billion credit facility backstops a $1.0 billion CenterPoint Energy commercial paper program under which we began issuing commercial paper in June 2005. The $915 million CERC Corp. credit facility backstops a $915 million commercial paper program under which CERC Corp. began issuing commercial paper in February 2008. As of December 31, 2010, CERC Corp. had $183 million of outstanding commercial paper. As a result of the credit ratings on the two commercial paper programs, we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short-term borrowing requirements. During 2010, CERC met substantially all of its liquidity requirements with borrowings from the money pool described below under Money Pool. During the fourth quarter of 2010, CERC also met a portion of its liquidity requirements with commercial paper proceeds. We currently expect that CERC may be required to access financing sources, in addition to money pool borrowings, in order to satisfy its liquidity requirements in 2011. These sources could include commercial paper proceeds or borrowings under CERC Corp. revolving credit or receivables facilities. Securities Registered with the SEC. CenterPoint Energy, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. have filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of CenterPoint Houston general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp. senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of CenterPoint Energy shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. Temporary Investments. As of February 15, 2011, we had no external temporary investments. Money Pool. We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based 57 on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. The interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on our credit rating. As of February 15, 2011, Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook (1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Ba1 Positive BBB- Stable BBB- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt A3 Stable BBB+ Stable A- Stable CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa3 Positive BBB Stable BBB Stable (1) A Moody rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A "stable" outlook from Fitch encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. We cannot assure you that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp. $915 million credit facility. If our credit ratings or those of CenterPoint Houston or CERC had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at December 31, 2010, the impact on the borrowing costs under our bank credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper markets. CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $120 million based on CERC Corp. S&P senior unsecured long-term debt rating of BBB. Under these agreements, CERC may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. M ark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2010, the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $107 million ($59 million of which is associated with price stabilization activities of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment). Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously 58 unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2010, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $248 million; however, utilized credit capacity was $79 million. Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $181 million as of December 31, 2010. The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels. In September 1999, we issued ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million remain outstanding at December 31, 2010. Each ZENS note was originally exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS note are adjusted for certain corporate events. As of December 31, 2010, the reference shares for each ZENS note consisted of 0.5 share of TW Common, 0.125505 share of Time Warner Cable Inc. common stock (TWC Common) and 0.045455 share of AOL Inc. common stock (AOL Common). If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS notes and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares would typically cease when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. In addition, three outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $750 million in principal amount as of December 31, 2010, provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures . From time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including our weather hedging arrangements, and gas purchases, gas price and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; 59 increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various legislative or regulatory actions; incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; the ability of GenOn and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of GenOn indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor; the ability of REPs, including REP subsidiaries of NRG Retail LLC and REP subsidiaries of TXU Energy Retail Company LLC, which are CenterPoint Houston two largest customers, to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money. CenterPoint Houston credit facilities limit CenterPoint Houston debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. CERC Corp. bank facility and its receivables facility limit CERC debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt, excluding transition and system restoration bonds, to EBITDA covenant. In February 2010, we amended our $1.2 billion credit facility to modify this covenant to allow for a temporary increase in debt capacity if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets c ertain criteria. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impac t on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee o f the board of directors. 60 Accounting for Rate Regulation Accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and portions of our Interstate Pipelines business segment apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabi lities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2010, we had recorded regulatory assets of $3.4 billion and regulatory liabilities of $989 million. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. No impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis at July 1, 2010. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rates, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amo unts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant 61 impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read Other Significant Matters Pension Plans for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 6(b) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA. We made no contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2008 or 2010; however, a discretionary contribution of $13 million was made in 2009. The minimum funding requirements for this plan did not require contributions for the respective years. We expect to make a minimum required contribution of $35 million in 2011. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $8 million, $7 million and $8 million in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. As the sponsor of a plan, we are required to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan over-funded status or as a liability such plan under-funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $468 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2011 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension cost was $1 million, $111 million and $86 million for 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, of which $1 million, $60 million and $44 million impacted pre-tax earnings. CenterPoint Houston actuarially determined pension and other postemployment expenses in excess of the 2007 base year amount are being deferred for rate making purposes until the conclusion of the current general rate case pursuant to Texas law. CenterPoint Houston deferred as a regulatory asset $32 million and $26 million in pension and other postemployment expenses during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. 62 As of December 31, 2010, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2009. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.25%, which is a 0.45% decrease from the 5.70% discount rate assumed in 2009. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension cost for 2011, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $78 million, of which we expect $59 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.00% and a discount rate of 5.25% as of December 31, 2010. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 8.00% to 7.50%, 2011 pension cost would increase by approximately $7 million. As of December 31, 2010, the pension plan projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded benefit restoration plan, exceeded plan assets by $468 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 5.25% to 4.75%, the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2011 pension expense by approximately $92 million and $5 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2010 by $75 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2010 of $11 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.
