Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp., and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states. Wholly owned subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. Another wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. Business Segments In this section, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. CenterPoint Energy is first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject. Our transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006, we are reporting our interstate pipelines and field services businesses as two separate business segments, Interstate Pipelines business segment and Field Services business segment. These business segments were previously aggregated and reported as the Pipelines and Field Services business segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2006 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to REPs serving approximately 2.0 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf coast that has a population of approximately 4.8 million people and includes Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout the control area managed by ERCOT, which serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission services are provided under tariffs approved by the Texas Utility Commission. Operations include construction and maintenance of electric transmission and distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and other call center operations. Distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Texas Utility Commission. 36 Table of Contents Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business, which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated retail and wholesale natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in the six states listed above as well as several other Midwestern and Eastern states. Interstate Pipelines CERC interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 7,900 miles of gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. This business also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59.0 Bcf. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. This business has begun construction of two significant pipeline additions, in one case as part of a joint venture. Field Services CERC field services business owns and operates approximately 3,700 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas from approximately 150 separate systems located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Other Operations Our Other Operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Significant Events in 2006 and 2007 Debt Financing Transactions In March 2006, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. entered into amended and restated bank credit facilities. We replaced our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 60 basis points based on our current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points for borrowings under the facility it replaced. CenterPoint Houston replaced its $200 million five-year revolving credit facility with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 75 basis points for borrowings under the facility it replaced. CERC Corp. replaced its $400 million five-year revolving credit facility with a $550 million five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 55 basis points for borrowings under the facility it replaced. Under each of the credit facilities, an additional utilization fee of 10 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized, and the spread to LIBOR fluctuates based on the borrower credit rating. In May 2006, CERC Corp. issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in May 2016 with an interest rate of 6.15%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate 37 Table of Contents purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt (including $145 million of CERC 8.90% debentures repaid December 15, 2006), capital expenditures and working capital. In December 2006, we called our 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (2.875% Convertible Notes) for redemption on January 22, 2007 at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The 2.875% Convertible Notes became immediately convertible at the option of the holders upon our call for redemption and were convertible through the close of business on the redemption date. Substantially all the $255 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible Notes were converted and the remaining amount was redeemed. The $255 million principal amount of the 2.875% Convertible Notes was settled in cash and the excess value due converting holders of $97 million was settled by delivering approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock. In February 2007, we redeemed $103 million aggregate principal amount of 8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures at 104.1285% of their aggregate principal amount and the related 8.257% capital securities issued by HL&P Capital Trust II were redeemed at 104.1285% of their $100 million aggregate liquidation value. In February 2007, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2017 with an interest rate of 5.95%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay debt incurred in satisfying our $255 million cash payment obligation in connection with the conversion and redemption of our 2.875% Convertible Notes as discussed above. In February 2007, CERC Corp. issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2037 with an interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay advances for the purchase of receivables under CERC Corp. $375 million receivables facility. Such repayment provides increased liquidity and capital resources for CERC general corporate purposes. Agreement Regarding Tax Settlement During the second quarter of 2006, we reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on terms of a settlement regarding the tax treatment of our Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes (ZENS) and our former Automatic Common Exchange Securities (ACES). In July 2006, we signed a closing agreement prepared by the IRS and us for the tax years 1999 through 2029 with respect to the ZENS issue. The agreement reached with the IRS and the closing agreement were subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the U.S. Congress (JCT). As a result of the agreement reached with the IRS, we reduced our previously accrued tax and related interest reserves by approximately $119 million in the second quarter of 2006, and no longer accrue a quarterly reserve. In January 2007, following JCT approval of certain revised terms of the agreement, we and the IRS executed a closing agreement on the tax treatment of the ZENS for the tax years 1999 through 2029. The items in dispute with respect to the ZENS and ACES have now been resolved. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we increased our tax and related interest reserve, reducing income by approximately $12 million to reflect the January 2007 closing agreement. Under the terms of the agreement reached with the IRS, we will pay approximately $109 million in previously accrued taxes associated with the ACES and the ZENS and will reduce our future interest deductions associated with the ZENS. Agreement regarding settlement of the Electric Transmission & Distribution Rate Case and the 2001 Unbundled Cost of Service (UCOS) Remand In September 2006, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission) gave final approval to a settlement agreement with the parties to the proceeding that resolved the issues raised in CenterPoint Houston 2006 rate case. Under the terms of the agreement, CenterPoint Houston base rate revenues were reduced by approximately $58 million per year. Also, CenterPoint Houston agreed to increase its energy efficiency expenditures by an additional $10 million per year over the $13 million then included in rates. The expenditures will be made to benefit both residential and commercial customers. CenterPoint Houston also will fund $10 million per year for programs providing financial assistance to qualified low-income customers in its service territory. The 38 Table of Contents agreement provides for a rate freeze until June 30, 2010 under which CenterPoint Houston will not seek to increase its base rates and the other parties will not petition to decrease those rates. The agreement also resolves all issues that could be raised in the Texas Utility Commission proceeding to review its decision in CenterPoint Houston 2001 UCOS case. Under the terms of the agreement, CenterPoint Houston added riders to its tariff rates under which it will provide rate credits to retail and wholesale customers for a total of approximately $8 million per year until a total of $32 million has been credited to customers under those tariff riders. CenterPoint Houston reduced revenues and established a corresponding regulatory liability for $32 million in the second quarter of 2006 to reflect this obligation. Competition Transition Charge (CTC) Interest Rate Reduction In January 2006, the Texas Utility Commission staff (Staff) proposed that the Texas Utility Commission adopt new rules governing the carrying charges on unrecovered true-up balances. In June 2006, the Texas Utility Commission adopted the revised rule as recommended by Staff. The rule, which applies to CenterPoint Houston, reduces the allowed interest rate on the unrecovered CTC balance prospectively from 11.075 percent to a weighted average cost of capital of 8.06 percent. The annualized impact on operating income is expected to be approximately $18 million per year for the first year with lesser impacts in subsequent years. In accordance with the agreement discussed above, CenterPoint Houston implemented the rule change effective August 1, 2006. Interstate Pipeline Expansion Carthage to Perryville. In October 2005, CEGT signed a 10-year firm transportation agreement with XTO Energy (XTO) to transport 600 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of natural gas from Carthage, Texas to CEGT Perryville hub in Northeast Louisiana. To accommodate this transaction, CEGT filed a certificate application with the FERC in March 2006 to build a 172-mile, 42-inch diameter pipeline and related compression facilities. The capacity of the pipeline under this filing will be 1.25 Bcf per day. CEGT has signed firm contracts for the full capacity of the pipeline. In October 2006, the FERC issued CEGT certificate to construct, own and operate the pipeline and compression facilities. CEGT has begun construction of the facilities and expects to place the facilities in service in the second quarter of 2007 at a cost of approximately $500 million. Based on interest expressed during an open season held in 2006, and subject to FERC approval, CEGT may expand capacity of the pipeline to 1.5 Bcf per day, which would bring the total estimated capital cost of the project to approximately $550 million. In September 2006, CEGT filed for approval to increase the maximum allowable operating pressure with the U.S. Department of Transportation. In December 2006, CEGT filed for the necessary certificate to expand capacity of the pipeline with the FERC. CEGT expects to receive the approvals in the third quarter of 2007. During the four-year period subsequent to the in-service date of the pipeline, XTO can request, and subject to mutual negotiations that meet specific financial parameters and to FERC approval, CEGT would construct a 67-mile extension from CEGT Perryville hub to an interconnect with Texas Eastern Gas Transmission at Union Church, Mississippi. Southeast Supply Header. In June 2006, CenterPoint Energy Southeast Pipelines Holding, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. and a subsidiary of Spectra Energy Corp. (Spectra) formed a joint venture (Southeast Supply Header or SESH) to construct, own and operate a 270-mile pipeline that will extend from CEGT Perryville hub in northeast Louisiana to Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is 50 percent owned by an affiliate of Spectra. In August 2006, the joint venture signed an agreement with Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) for firm transportation services, which subscribed approximately half of the planned 1 Bcf per day capacity of the pipeline. FPL commitment was contingent on the approval of the FPL contract by the Florida Public Service Commission, which was received in December 2006. Subject to the joint venture receiving a certificate from the FERC to construct, own and operate the pipeline, subsidiaries of Spectra and CERC Corp. have committed to build the pipeline. In December 2006, the joint venture signed agreements with affiliates of Progress Energy Florida, Southern Company, Tampa Electric Company, and EOG Resources, Inc. bringing the total subscribed capacity to 39 Table of Contents 945 MMcf per day. Additionally, SESH and Southern Natural Gas (SNG) have executed a definitive agreement that provides for SNG to jointly own the first 115 miles of the pipeline. Under the agreement, SNG will own an undivided interest in the portion of the pipeline from Perryville, Louisiana to an interconnect with SNG in Mississippi. The pipe diameter will be increased from 36 inches to 42 inches, thereby increasing the initial capacity of 1 Bcf per day by 140 MMcf per day to accommodate SNG. SESH will own assets providing approximately 1 Bcf per day of capacity as initially planned and will maintain economic expansion opportunities in the future. SNG will own assets providing 140 MMcf per day of capacity, and the agreement provides for a future compression expansion that could increase the capacity up to 500 MMcf per day. An application to construct, own and operate the pipeline was filed with the FERC in December 2006. Subject to receipt of FERC authorization and construction in accordance with planned schedule, we currently expect an in service date in the summer of 2008. The total cost of the combined project is estimated to be $800 to $900 million with SESH net costs of $700 to $800 million after SNG contribution. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: the timing and amount of our recovery of the true-up components, including, in particular, the results of appeals to the courts of determinations on rulings obtained to date; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments, including deregulation, re-regulation, changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to other aspects of our business; timely and appropriate rate actions and increases, allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas; changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; weather variations and other natural phenomena; the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas; the timing and extent of changes in natural gas basis differentials; commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; actions by rating agencies; effectiveness of our risk management activities; inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers, including Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI); the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations to us, including indemnity obligations, or in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor; the outcome of litigation brought by or against us; our ability to control costs; the investment performance of our employee benefit plans; 40 Table of Contents our potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which we cannot be assured to be completed or to have the anticipated benefits to us; and other factors we discuss under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and in other reports we file from time to time with the SEC. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Revenues $ 7,999 $ 9,722 $ 9,319 Expenses 7,135 8,783 8,274 Operating Income 864 939 1,045 Gain (Loss) on Time Warner Investment 31 (44 ) 94 Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities (20 ) 49 (80 ) Interest and Other Finance Charges (739 ) (670 ) (470 ) Interest on Transition Bonds (38 ) (40 ) (130 ) Return on True-Up Balance 226 121 Other Income, net 20 23 35 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Item 344 378 494 Income Tax Expense 139 153 62 Income From Continuing Operations Before Extraordinary Item 205 225 432 Discontinued Operations, net of tax (133 ) (3 ) Income Before Extraordinary Item 72 222 432 Extraordinary Item, net of tax (977 ) 30 Net Income (Loss) $ (905 ) $ 252 $ 432 Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share: Income From Continuing Operations Before Extraordinary Item $ 0.67 $ 0.72 $ 1.39 Discontinued Operations, net of tax (0.43 ) (0.01 ) Extraordinary Item, net of tax (3.18 ) 0.10 Net Income (Loss) $ (2.94 ) $ 0.81 $ 1.39 Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share: Income From Continuing Operations Before Extraordinary Item $ 0.61 $ 0.67 $ 1.33 Discontinued Operations, net of tax (0.37 ) (0.01 ) Extraordinary Item, net of tax (2.72 ) 0.09 Net Income (Loss) $ (2.48 ) $ 0.75 $ 1.33 2006 Compared to 2005 Income from Continuing Operations. We reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of $432 million ($1.33 per diluted share) for 2006 as compared to $225 million ($0.67 per diluted share) for the same period in 2005. As discussed below, the increase in income from continuing operations of $207 million was primarily due to a $200 million decrease in interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, due to lower borrowing costs and borrowing levels; a $133 million decrease in income tax expense related to our ZENS and ACES; a $19 million increase in operating income from our Field Services business segment; a $17 million increase in operating income from our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment; and a $16 million increase in operating income from our Interstate Pipelines business segment. 41 Table of Contents These increases in income from continuing operations were partially offset by a $121 million decrease in other income related to a reduction in the return on the true-up balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment recorded in 2005 and a $51 million decrease in operating income from our Natural Gas Distribution business segment. Segment changes are discussed in detail below. Income Tax Expense. In 2006, our effective tax rate was 12.6%. We reached an agreement with the IRS in January 2007 and have reduced our previously accrued tax and related interest reserves related to the ZENS and ACES by approximately $107 million and no longer accrue a quarterly reserve for this item. The net reduction in the reserves related to ZENS and ACES in 2006 was $92 million. In addition, we reached tentative settlements with the IRS on a number of other tax matters which allowed us to reduce our total tax and related interest reserve for other tax items from $60 million at December 31, 2005 to $34 million at December 31, 2006. 2005 Compared to 2004 Income from Continuing Operations. We reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of $225 million ($0.67 per diluted share) for 2005 as compared to $205 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for 2004. The increase in income from continuing operations of $20 million was primarily due to increased operating income of $36 million in our Interstate Pipelines business segment resulting from increased demand for transportation due to increased basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services, increased operating income of $19 million in our Field Services business segment as a result of increased throughput and demand for services related to our core natural gas gathering operations, increased operating income of $16 million in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment primarily due to higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control, a decrease in the operating loss of $14 million in our Other Operations business segment resulting from increased overhead allocated out in 2005 and a $67 million decrease in interest expense due to lower borrowing levels and lower borrowing costs reflecting the replacement of certain of our credit facilities. The above increases were partially offset by a decrease of $105 million in the return on the true-up balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment as a result of the True-Up Order, partially offset by an increase in operating income of $21 million related to the return on the true-up balance being recovered through the CTC, and decreased operating income of $29 million in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, excluding the CTC operating income discussed above, primarily from increased franchise fees paid to the City of Houston, increased depreciation expense and higher operation and maintenance expenses, including higher transmission costs, the absence of a $15 million partial reversal of a reserve related to the final fuel reconciliation recorded in the second quarter of 2004 and the absence of an $11 million gain from a land sale recorded in 2004, partially offset by increased usage mainly due to weather, continued customer growth and higher transmission cost recovery. Additionally, income tax expense increased $14 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Net income for 2005 included an after-tax extraordinary gain of $30 million ($0.09 per diluted share) recorded in the first quarter reflecting an adjustment to the extraordinary loss recorded in the last half of 2004 to write down generation-related regulatory assets as a result of the final orders issued by the Texas Utility Commission. Income Tax Expense. In 2005, our effective tax rate was 40.6%. The most significant items affecting our effective tax rate in 2005 were an addition to the tax and related interest reserves of approximately $41 million relating to the contention of the IRS that the current deductions for original issue discount (OID) on our ZENS be capitalized, potentially converting what have been ordinary deductions into capital losses at the time the ZENS are settled, partially offset by favorable tax audit adjustments of $10 million. Interest Expense and Other Finance Charges In the fourth quarter of 2004, we reduced borrowings under our credit facility by $1.574 billion and retired $375 million of trust preferred securities. We expensed $15 million of unamortized loan costs in the fourth quarter of 2004 that were associated with the credit facility. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 87-24 Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations, we have reclassified interest to discontinued operations of Texas Genco based on net proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco of $2.5 billion, and have applied the proceeds to the amount of debt assumed to be paid down in each respective period according to the terms 42 Table of Contents of the respective credit facilities in effect for those periods. In periods where only the term loan was assumed to be repaid, the actual interest paid on the term loan was reclassified. In periods where a portion of the revolver was assumed to be repaid, the percentage of that portion of the revolver to the total outstanding balance was calculated, and that percentage was applied to the actual interest paid in those periods to compute the amount of interest reclassified. During the fourth quarter of 2005, CenterPoint Houston retired at maturity its $1.341 billion term loan, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 975 basis points, subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 3 percent. Borrowings under a CenterPoint Houston credit facility, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points, were used for the payment of the term loan and then repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the December 2005 issuance of transition bonds. Total interest expense incurred was $849 million, $711 million and $600 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. We have reclassified $72 million and $1 million of interest expense in 2004 and 2005, respectively, based upon actual interest expense incurred within our discontinued operations and interest expense associated with debt that would have been required to be repaid as a result of our disposition of Texas Genco. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2004, 2005 and 2006. Due to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2006, we have recast our segment information for 2004 and 2005 to conform to the 2006 presentation. The segment detail revised as a result of the new reportable business segments did not affect consolidated operating income for any year. Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $576 million for 2006, consisting of $450 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility (TDU) (including $55 million arising from the CTC) and $126 million related to the transition bonds. For 2005, operating income totaled $487 million, consisting of $448 million for the TDU (including $19 million arising from the CTC) and $39 million related to the transition bonds. Increases in operating income from customer growth ($34 million), a higher CTC amount collected in 2006 ($36 million), revenues from ancillary services ($11 million) and proceeds from land sales ($13 million) were partially offset by milder weather and reduced demand ($49 million), the implementation of reduced base rates ($13 million) and spending on low income assistance and energy efficiency programs ($5 million) resulting from the Settlement Agreement described in Business Our Business Regulation State and Local Regulation Electric Transmission & Distribution CenterPoint Energy Rate Case in Item 1 of this report. In addition, the TDU operating income for 2006 includes the $32 million adverse impact of the resolution of the remand of the 2001 UCOS order recorded in the second quarter. 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $487 million for 2005, consisting of $448 million for the TDU and $39 million related to the transition bonds. For 2004, operating income totaled $494 million, consisting of $456 million for the TDU and $38 million for the transition bonds. Operating revenues increased primarily due to increased usage resulting from warmer weather ($13 million), continued customer growth ($33 million) with the addition of 61,000 metered customers in 2005, recovery of our 2004 true-up balance not covered by the transition bond financing order ($21 million) and higher 44 Table of Contents transmission cost recovery ($13 million). The increase in operating revenues was more than offset by higher transmission costs ($24 million), the absence of a gain from a land sale recorded in 2004 ($11 million), the absence of a $15 million partial reversal of a reserve related to the final fuel reconciliation recorded in 2004, increased employee-related expenses ($20 million) and higher tree trimming expense ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in pension expense ($14 million). Depreciation and amortization expense increased ($10 million) primarily as a result of higher plant balances. Taxes other than income taxes increased ($11 million) primarily due to higher franchise fees paid to the City of Houston. In September 2005, CenterPoint Houston service area in Texas was adversely affected by Hurricane Rita. Although damage to CenterPoint Houston electric facilities was limited, over 700,000 customers lost power at the height of the storm. Power was restored to over a half million customers within 36 hours and all power was restored in less than five days. The Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment revenues lost as a result of the storm were more than offset by warmer than normal weather during the third quarter of 2005. CenterPoint Houston deferred $28 million of restoration costs which are being amortized over a seven-year period that began in October 2006. Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Revenues $ 3,579 $ 3,846 $ 3,593 Expenses: Natural gas 2,596 2,841 2,598 Operation and maintenance 544 551 594 Depreciation and amortization 141 152 152 Taxes other than income taxes 120 127 125 Total expenses 3,401 3,671 3,469 Operating Income $ 178 $ 175 $ 124 Throughput (in billion cubic feet (Bcf)): Residential 175 160 152 Commercial and industrial 237 215 224 Total Throughput 412 375 376 Average number of customers: Residential 2,798,352 2,839,947 2,883,927 Commercial and industrial 245,926 244,782 243,265 Total 3,044,278 3,084,729 3,127,192 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $124 million for 2006 as compared to $175 million for 2005. Decreases in operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) include a $21 million write-off in the fourth quarter of 2006 of purchased gas costs for periods prior to July 2004, the recovery of which was denied by the MPUC, and the impact of milder weather and decreased usage ($30 million). These decreases were partially offset by higher margins from rate and service charge increases and rate design changes ($35 million), along with the addition of over 42,000 customers in 2006 ($9 million). Operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily as a result of costs associated with staff reductions ($17 million), benefit costs increases ($6 million), higher costs of goods and services ($8 million) and higher bad debt expenses ($10 million), partially offset by higher litigation reserves recorded in 2005 ($11 million). 45 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $175 million for 2005 as compared to $178 million for 2004. Increases in operating margins from rate increases ($19 million) and margin from gas exchanges ($7 million) were partially offset by the impact of milder weather and decreased throughput net of continued customer growth with the addition of approximately 44,000 customers in 2005 ($13 million). Operation and maintenance expense increased $7 million. Excluding an $8 million charge recorded in 2004 for severance costs associated with staff reductions, operation and maintenance expenses increased by $15 million primarily due to increased litigation reserves ($11 million) and increased bad debt expense ($9 million), partially offset by the capitalization of previously incurred restructuring expenses as allowed by a regulatory order from the Railroad Commission of Texas ($5 million). Additionally, operating income was unfavorably impacted by increased depreciation expense primarily due to higher plant balances ($11 million). During the third quarter of 2005, our east Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas service areas were affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Damage to our facilities was limited, but approximately 10,000 homes and businesses were damaged to such an extent that they were not able to, and in some cases continue to be unable to, take service. The impact on the Natural Gas Distribution business segment operating income was not material. Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Revenues $ 2,848 $ 4,129 $ 3,651 Expenses: Natural gas 2,778 4,033 3,540 Operation and maintenance 22 30 30 Depreciation and amortization 2 2 1 Taxes other than income taxes 2 4 3 Total expenses 2,804 4,069 3,574 Operating Income $ 44 $ 60 $ 77 Throughput (in Bcf): Wholesale third parties 228 304 335 Wholesale affiliates 35 27 36 Retail 141 156 149 Pipeline 76 51 35 Total Throughput 480 538 555 Average number of customers: Wholesale 97 138 140 Retail 5,976 6,328 6,452 Pipeline 172 142 138 Total 6,245 6,608 6,730 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $77 million for 2006 as compared to $60 million for 2005. The increase in operating income of $17 million was primarily driven by improved operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) resulting from seasonal price differentials and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control ($44 million) and a favorable change in unrealized gains resulting from mark-to-market accounting ($37 million), partially offset by write-downs of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($66 million). 46 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $60 million for 2005 as compared to $44 million for 2004. The increase in operating income of $16 million was primarily due to increased operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) related to higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control ($32 million) less the impact of certain derivative transactions ($6 million), partially offset by higher payroll and benefit related expenses ($4 million) and increased bad debt expense ($3 million). Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Revenues $ 368 $ 386 $ 388 Expenses: Natural gas 58 47 31 Operation and maintenance 131 121 120 Depreciation and amortization 36 36 37 Taxes other than income taxes 14 17 19 Total expenses 239 221 207 Operating Income $ 129 $ 165 $ 181 Throughput (in Bcf): Transportation 859 914 939 Other 4 2 1 Total Throughput 863 916 940 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Interstate Pipelines business segment reported operating income of $181 million for 2006 as compared to $165 million for 2005. Operating margins (natural gas sales less gas cost) increased by $18 million. This increase was driven primarily by increased demand for transportation services and ancillary services ($15 million). Operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $1 million primarily due to the gain on sale of excess gas during 2006 ($18 million) combined with lower litigation reserves ($6 million) in 2006 compared to 2005. These favorable variances were partially offset by a write-off of expenses associated with the Mid-Continent Crossing pipeline project which was discontinued in 2006 ($11 million) as well as increased operating expenses ($11 million) largely associated with staffing increases and costs associated with continued compliance with pipeline integrity regulations. 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Interstate Pipelines business segment reported operating income of $165 million compared to $129 million in 2004. Operating margins (revenues less natural gas costs) increased by $29 million. The increase was primarily related to increased demand for certain transportation services driven by commodity price volatility as well as favorable pricing on certain transportation deliveries driven by favorable basis differentials relative to competing supply areas ($42 million). These favorable margin variances were partially offset by lower project-related revenues ($11 million). Operation and Maintenance expenses decreased by $10 million primarily due to lower cost incurred in support of project-related revenues ($9 million). 47 Table of Contents Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Revenues $ 92 $ 120 $ 150 Expenses: Natural gas (9 ) (10 ) (10 ) Operation and maintenance 40 49 59 Depreciation and amortization 8 9 10 Taxes other than income taxes 2 2 2 Total expenses 41 50 61 Operating Income $ 51 $ 70 $ 89 Throughput (in Bcf): Gathering 321 353 375 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $89 million for 2006 as compared to $70 million for 2005. The increase of $19 million was driven by increased gas gathering and ancillary services, which reflects contributions from new facilities placed in service ($27 million) and higher commodity prices ($3 million), partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses ($10 million). Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $6 million for each of the years 2006 and 2005 and is included in other income. 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $70 million for 2005 compared to $51 million in 2004. The increase of $19 million was driven by increased gas gathering and ancillary services ($22 million) and higher commodity prices ($7 million), partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses ($9 million). Equity income from the jointly-owned gas processing plant was $6 million and $2 million for the years 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is included in other income. Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Revenues $ 8 $ 19 $ 15 Expenses 40 37 17 Operating Loss $ (32 ) $ (18 ) $ (2 ) 2006 Compared to 2005. Our Other Operations business segment operating loss in 2006 compared to 2005 decreased $16 million primarily due to increased rental revenues ($2 million), decreased insurance costs ($4 million), and decreased state franchise taxes ($8 million). 2005 Compared to 2004. Our Other Operations business segment operating loss in 2005 compared to 2004 decreased $14 million primarily due to increased overhead allocated in 2005. 48 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations In July 2004, we announced our agreement to sell our majority owned subsidiary, Texas Genco, to Texas Genco LLC. In December 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas Genco, whose principal remaining asset was its ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility, distributed $2.231 billion in cash to us. The final step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of $700 million, was completed in April 2005. We recorded an after-tax loss of $133 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, related to the operations of Texas Genco. The consolidated financial statements report the businesses described above as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). For further information regarding discontinued operations, please read Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flow The net cash provided by(used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2004, 2005 and 2006 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 736 $ 63 $ 991 Investing activities 1,466 17 (1,056 ) Financing activities (2,124 ) (171 ) 118 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 increased $928 million compared to 2005 primarily due to decreased tax payments of $156 million, the majority of which related to the tax payment in the first quarter of 2005 associated with the sale of our former electric generation business (Texas Genco); increased fuel over-recovery ($240 million) primarily related to declining gas prices during 2006; decreases in net regulatory assets ($271 million), primarily due to the termination of excess mitigation credits effective April 2005 and recovery of regulatory assets through rates; increased net accounts receivable/payable ($128 million) primarily due to decreased gas prices as compared to 2005 partially offset by funding under CERC receivables facility being accounted for as short-term borrowings instead of sales of receivables beginning in October 2006 and decreased cash used in the operations of Texas Genco ($38 million). Additionally, customer margin deposit requirements decreased ($155 million) primarily due to the decline in natural gas prices from December 2005 and our margin deposits increased ($52 million). Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 decreased $673 million compared to 2004 primarily due to increased tax payments of $475 million, the majority of which related to the tax payment in the second quarter of 2005 associated with the sale of Texas Genco, decreased cash provided by Texas Genco of $393 million, increased net accounts receivable/payable ($151 million), increased gas storage inventory ($105 million) and increased fuel under-recovery ($154 million), primarily due to higher gas prices in 2005 as compared to 2004. These decreases were partially offset by decreases in net regulatory assets/liabilities ($328 million), primarily due to the termination of excess mitigation credits effective April 29, 2005, and decreased pension contributions of $401 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. 49 Table of Contents Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.1 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased capital expenditures of $314 million primarily related to our Electric Transmission & Distribution, Interstate Pipelines, and Field Services business segments, increased restricted cash of transition bond companies of $36 million primarily related to the $1.85 billion of transition bonds issued in December 2005 and the absence of $700 million in proceeds received in the second quarter of 2005 from the sale of our remaining interest in Texas Genco and cash of Texas Genco of $24 million. Net cash provided by investing activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to proceeds of $700 million received from the sale of our remaining interest in Texas Genco in April 2005 compared to proceeds of $2.947 billion received in 2004 from the sale of Texas Genco fossil generation assets and increased capital expenditures of $89 million, partially offset by the purchase of the minority interest in Texas Genco in 2004 of $716 million and cash collateralization of letters of credit by Texas Genco in 2004 related to its anticipated purchase of an additional interest in the South Texas Project in the first half of 2005 of $191 million. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 increased $289 million compared to 2005 primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $324 million, decreased repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility ($236 million) and funding under CERC receivables facility being accounted for as short-term borrowings ($187 million) in 2006, partially offset by the absence of borrowings under Texas Genco revolving credit facility ($75 million) due to the sale of Texas Genco, payments of long-term debt ($229 million) and increased dividend payments of $63 million. In 2005, debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by $66 million. Proceeds from the December 2005 issuance of $1.85 billion in transition bonds were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and CenterPoint Houston $1.3 billion term loan. Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal cash requirements for 2007 include the following: approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditures; cash settlement obligations in connection with possible conversions by holders of our 3.75% convertible senior notes, having an aggregate principal amount of $575 million; dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and debt service payments; settlement of our 2.875% convertible senior notes for $255 million and settlement of our 8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures for $104 million, as discussed in Notes 8(b) and 15 to our consolidated financial statements; and $153 million of maturing long-term debt, including $147 million of transition bonds. We expect that long-term debt securities issued in the first quarter of 2007 ($400 million), borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months. Cash needs may also be met by issuing equity or debt securities in the capital markets. 50 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2006 and estimates of our capital requirements for 2007 through 2011 (in millions): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Electric Transmission & Distribution $ 389 $ 408 $ 406 $ 402 $ 437 $ 435 Natural Gas Distribution 187 208 217 202 207 212 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 18 18 12 12 12 12 Interstate Pipelines 437 272 269 45 54 62 Field Services 65 116 86 85 85 85 Other Operations 25 33 26 21 12 13 Total $ 1,121 $ 1,055 $ 1,016 $ 767 $ 807 $ 819 The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): 2012 and Contractual Obligations Total 2007 2008-2009 2010-2011 thereafter Transition bond debt, including current portion 2,407 147 334 397 1,529 Other long-term debt, including current portion 6,593 476 513 781 4,823 Interest payments transition bond debt(1) 867 123 224 187 333 Interest payments other long-term debt(1) 4,702 419 798 745 2,740 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases(2) 80 22 29 14 15 Benefit obligations(3) Purchase obligations(4) 181 181 Non-trading derivative liabilities 221 141 44 36 Other commodity commitments(5) 3,044 922 504 412 1,206 Total contractual cash obligations 18,096 2,431 2,446 2,572 10,647 (1) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2006. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (2) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 10(b) to our consolidated financial statements. (3) Contributions to our qualified pension plan are not required in 2007. However, we expect to contribute approximately $7 million and $29 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2007. (4) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with the construction of a new pipeline by our Interstate Pipelines business segment. This project has been included in the table of capital expenditures presented above. (5) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 10(a) to our consolidated financial statements. Convertible Debt. As of December 31, 2006, the 3.75% convertible senior notes discussed in Note 8(b) to our consolidated financial statements have been included as current portion of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the last reported sale price of CenterPoint Energy common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the fourth quarter of 2006 was greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price of the 3.75% convertible senior notes and therefore, during the first quarter of 2007, the 3.75% convertible senior notes meet the criteria that make them eligible for conversion at the option of the holders of these notes. 51 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, our 2.875% convertible senior notes discussed in Note 8(b) to our consolidated financial statements were included as current portion of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because in December 2006, we called our 2.875% convertible senior notes for redemption on January 22, 2007. Junior Subordinated Debentures (Trust Preferred Securities). As of December 31, 2006, our 8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures discussed in Note 8(b) to our consolidated financial statements have been included as current portion of long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because in December 2006, we called our 8.257% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures for redemption in February 2007. Arkansas Public Service Commissions, Affiliate Transaction Rulemaking Proceeding. In Arkansas, the APSC in December 2006 adopted rules governing affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in Arkansas. The rules treat as affiliate transactions all transactions between CERC Arkansas utility operations and other divisions of CERC, as well as transactions between the Arkansas utility operations and affiliates of CERC. All such affiliate transactions are required to be priced under an asymmetrical pricing formula under which the Arkansas utility operations would benefit from any difference between the cost of providing goods and services to or from the Arkansas utility operations and the market value of those goods or services. Additionally, the Arkansas utility operations are not permitted to participate in any financing other than to finance retail utility operations in Arkansas, which would preclude continuation of existing financing arrangements in which CERC finances its divisions and subsidiaries, including its Arkansas utility operations. Although the Arkansas rules are now in effect, CERC and other gas and electric utilities operating in Arkansas sought reconsideration of the rules by the APSC. In February 2007, the APSC granted that reconsideration and suspended operation of the rules in order to permit time for additional consideration. If the rules are not significantly modified on reconsideration, CERC would be entitled to seek judicial review. In adopting the rules, the APSC indicated that affiliate transactions and financial arrangements currently in effect will be deemed in compliance until December 19, 2007, and that utilities may seek waivers of specific provisions of the rules. If the rules ultimately become effective as presently adopted, CERC would need to seek waivers from certain provisions of the rules or would be required to make significant modifications to existing practices, which could include the formation of and transfer of assets to subsidiaries. If this regulatory framework becomes effective, it could have adverse impacts on CERC ability to operate and provide cost-effective utility service. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than operating leases and the guaranties described below, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to our distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure us and CERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of CERC and us, and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. CERC currently holds letters of credit in the amount of $33.3 million issued on behalf of RRI against guaranties that have not been released. Our current exposure under the guaranties relates to CERC guaranty of the payment by RRI of demand charges related to transportation contracts with one counterparty. The demand charges are approximately $53 million per year through 2015, $49 million in 2016, $38 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2018. RRI continues to meet its obligations under the transportation contracts, and we believe current market conditions make those contracts valuable for transportation services in the near term. However, changes in market conditions could affect the value of those contracts. If RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the transportation contracts, our exposure to the counterparty under the guaranty could exceed the security provided by RRI. We have requested RRI to increase the amount of its existing letters of credit or, in the alternative, to obtain a release of CERC obligations under the guaranty. In June 2006, the RRI trading subsidiary and CERC jointly filed a complaint at the FERC against the counterparty on the CERC guaranty. In the complaint, the RRI trading subsidiary seeks a determination by the FERC that the security demanded by the counterparty exceeds the level permitted by the FERC policies. The complaint asks the FERC to require the counterparty to release CERC from its guaranty obligation and, in its place, accept (i) a guaranty from RRI of the obligations of the RRI trading subsidiary, and 52 Table of Contents (ii) letters of credit limited to (A) one year of demand charges for a transportation agreement related to a 2003 expansion of the counterparty pipeline, and (B) three months of demand charges for three other transportation agreements held by the RRI trading subsidiary. The counterparty has argued that the amount of the guaranty does not violate the FERC policies and that the proposed substitution of credit support is not authorized under the counterparty financing documents or required by the FERC policy. The parties have now completed their submissions to the FERC regarding the complaint. We cannot predict what action the FERC may take on the complaint or when the FERC may rule. In addition to the FERC proceeding, in February 2007 CenterPoint and CERC made a formal demand on RRI under procedures provided for by the Master Separation Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2000, between Reliant Energy, Incorporated and Reliant Resources, Inc. That demand seeks to resolve the disagreement with RRI over the amount of security RRI is obligated to provide with respect to this guaranty. It is possible that this demand could lead to an arbitration proceeding between the companies, but when and on what terms the disagreement with RRI will ultimately be resolved cannot now be predicted. Senior Notes. In May 2006, CERC Corp. issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in May 2016 with an interest rate of 6.15%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt (including $145 million of CERC 8.90% debentures repaid December 15, 2006), capital expenditures and working capital. In February 2007, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2017 with an interest rate of 5.95%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay debt incurred in satisfying our $255 million cash payment obligation in connection with the conversion and redemption of our 2.875% Convertible Notes. In February 2007, CERC Corp. issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2037 with an interest rate of 6.25%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay advances for the purchase of receivables under CERC Corp. $375 million receivables facility. Such repayment provides increased liquidity and capital resources for CERC general corporate purposes. Credit Facilities. In March 2006, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp., entered into amended and restated bank credit facilities. We replaced our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 60 basis points based on our current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points for borrowings under the facility it replaced. The facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant. CenterPoint Houston replaced its $200 million five-year revolving credit facility with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 75 basis points for borrowings under the facility it replaced. The facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition bonds) to total capitalization covenant of 65%. CERC Corp. replaced its $400 million five-year revolving credit facility with a $550 million five-year revolving credit facility. The facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings, as compared to LIBOR plus 55 basis points for borrowings under the facility it replaced. The facility contains covenants, including a debt to total capitalization covenant of 65%. Under each of the credit facilities, an additional utilization fee of 10 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized, and the spread to LIBOR fluctuates based on the borrower credit rating. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. consider customary. In October 2006, the termination date of CERC receivables facility was extended to October 2007. The facility size was $250 million until December 2006, is $375 million from December 2006 to May 2007 and ranges 53 Table of Contents from $150 million to $325 million during the period from May 2007 to the October 30, 2007 termination date of the facility. We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants contained in the respective receivables and credit facilities. As of February 16, 2007, we had the following facilities (in millions): Facility Size at February 16, Amount Utilized at Date Executed Company Type of Facility 2007 February 16, 2007 Termination Date March 31, 2006 CenterPoint Energy Revolver $ 1,200 $ 28 (1) March 31, 2011 March 31, 2006 CenterPoint Houston Revolver 300 4 (1) March 31, 2011 March 31, 2006 CERC Corp.

The $1.2 billion CenterPoint Energy credit facility backstops a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which CenterPoint Energy began issuing commercial paper in June 2005. As of December 31, 2006, there was no commercial paper outstanding. The commercial paper is rated Not Prime by Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), A-3 by Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and F3 by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) and, as a result, we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short-term borrowing requirements. We cannot assure you that these ratings, or the credit ratings set forth below in Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings, will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. Securities Registered with the SEC. At December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Energy had a shelf registration statement covering senior debt securities, preferred stock and common stock aggregating $1 billion and CERC Corp. had a shelf registration statement covering $500 million principal amount of senior debt securities. Following February 2007 note issuances of $250 million and $150 million by CenterPoint Energy and CERC Corp., respectively, CenterPoint Energy shelf registration statement covered securities aggregating $750 million and CERC Corp. shelf registration covered $350 million principal amount of senior debt securities. Temporary Investments. As of December 31, 2006, we had external temporary investments of less than $1 million. As of February 16, 2007, we had external temporary investments of $7 million. Money Pool. We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. As of February 16, 2007, Moody s, S&P, and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook(1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Ba1 Stable BBB- Stable BBB- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt (First Mortgage Bonds) Baa2 Stable BBB Stable A- Stable CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa3 Stable BBB Stable BBB Stable (1) A stable outlook from Moody indicates that Moody does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within 18 months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed. 54 Table of Contents (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A stable outlook from Fitch encompasses a one-to-two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $300 million credit facility and CERC Corp. $550 million credit facility. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce margins of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments. In September 1999, we issued 2.0% ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million remain outstanding. Each ZENS note is exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to each ZENS note. If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the ZENS notes and TW Common shares become current tax obligations when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common shares are sold. The ultimate tax obligation related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of ZENS notes maturing or being retired. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2006, the amount posted as collateral amounted to $113 million. Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral on two business days notice up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2006, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $133 million; however, utilized credit capacity is significantly lower. In addition, CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $100 million based on CERC Corp. S&P Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt rating of BBB. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. In connection with the development of the Southeast Supply Header, CERC Corp. has committed that it will advance funds to the joint venture or cause funds to be advanced, up to $400 million, for its 50 percent share of the cost to construct the pipeline. CERC Corp. also agreed to provide a letter of credit in the amount of its share of funds which have not been advanced in the event S&P reduces CERC Corp. bond rating below investment grade before CERC Corp. has advanced the required construction funds. However, CERC Corp. is relieved of these commitments (i) to the extent of 50 percent of any borrowing agreements that the joint venture has obtained and maintains for funding the construction of the pipeline and (ii) to the extent CERC Corp. or its subsidiary participating in the joint venture obtains committed borrowing agreements pursuant to which funds may be borrowed and used for the construction of the pipeline. A similar commitment has been provided by the other party to the joint venture. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will 55 Table of Contents cause a default. In addition, six outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $1.4 billion in principal amount as of February 16, 2007, provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including gas purchases, gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments, particularly given gas price levels and volatility; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various regulatory actions; the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of CenterPoint Houston and in respect of RRI indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices; cash payments in connection with the exercise of contingent conversion rights of holders of convertible debt; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes; and various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money. CenterPoint Houston credit facility limits CenterPoint Houston debt (excluding transition bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65 percent. CERC Corp. bank facility and its receivables facility limit CERC debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65 percent. Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt to EBITDA covenant. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston is contractually prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from issuing additional first mortgage bonds. 56 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. Accounting for Rate Regulation SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business applies SFAS No. 71, which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our former electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of SFAS No. 71 with respect to our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment relate to $304 million of recoverable electric generation-related regulatory assets as of December 31, 2006. These costs are recoverable under the provisions of the 1999 Texas Electric Choice Plan. Based on our analysis of the final order issued by the Texas Utility Commission, we recorded an after-tax charge to earnings in 2004 of approximately $977 million to write down our electric generation-related regulatory assets to their realizable value, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss. Based on subsequent orders received from the Texas Utility Commission, we recorded an extraordinary gain of $30 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2005 related to the regulatory asset. Additionally, a district court in Travis County, Texas issued a judgment that would have the effect of restoring approximately $650 million, plus interest, of disallowed costs. CenterPoint Houston and other parties appealed the district court judgment. Oral arguments before the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals were held in January 2007, but a decision is not expected for several months. No amounts related to the district court judgment have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. No impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis as of July 1, 2006. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. 57 Table of Contents Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. Asset Retirement Obligations We account for our long-lived assets under SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations An Interpretation of SFAS No. 143 (FIN 47). SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In the same period, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Rate-regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, and costs recovered through the ratemaking process. We estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components: Inflation adjustment The estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor, equipment, materials, and other disposal costs; Discount rate The estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium; and Third party markup adjustments Internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset. Changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47. For example, if the inflation adjustment increased 25 basis points, this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 3.0%. Similarly, an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage. At December 31, 2006, our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately $84 million. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to the sale and/or delivery of electricity or natural gas (energy) are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant 58 Table of Contents impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read Other Significant Matters Pension Plans for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 2(p) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. Although we were not required to make contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2005 or 2006, we made a voluntary contribution of $75 million in 2005. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $10 million and $7 million in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires us, as the sponsor of a plan, to (a) recognize on our balance sheets as an asset a plan over-funded status or as a liability such plan under-funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006, we recorded a regulatory asset of $466 million and a charge to accumulated comprehensive income of $79 million, net of tax. For additional information regarding the implementation of SFAS No. 158, see Note 2(o). At December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans exceeded the market value of plan assets by $30 million. Changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2007 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension costs were $86 million, $36 million and $46 million for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. In addition, included in the costs for 2004 and 2005 are $11 million and less than $1 million, respectively, of expense related to Texas Genco participants. Pension expense for Texas Genco participants is reflected in our Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the 59 Table of Contents assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2006, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.5%, which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2005. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.85%, which is a 0.15% increase from the 5.70% discount rate assumed in 2005. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension expense for 2007, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $15 million based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.5% and a discount rate of 5.85% as of December 31, 2006. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.5% (from 8.5% to 8.0%), 2007 pension expense would increase by approximately $9 million. Currently, pension plan assets (including the unfunded benefit restoration plan) exceed the accumulated benefit obligation by $30 million. However, if the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 5.85% to 5.35%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2007 pension expense by approximately $123 million and $11 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2006 by $95 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2006 of $18 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.
