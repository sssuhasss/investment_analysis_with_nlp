ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended December 31, 2011. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements inside the front cover of this Form 10-K. OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Dover delivered a record year in 2011 in terms of revenue, earnings, and bookings. Our consolidated revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 20%, to $8.0 billion, inclusive of acquisitions, while our bookings grew by $1.2 billion, or 17%, to $8.1 billion, and our gross profit grew by $435 million, or 17%, to $3.1 billion. However, our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points to 38.4% mainly due to product and customer mix as well as the impact of recent acquisitions, which more than offset operating leverage. Earnings from continuing operations increased 23% to $846 million. In addition to our strong financial results, we accomplished several important strategic initiatives in 2011. We realigned our businesses into four new segments to more closely match our key end-markets. This new structure will serve to support our growth strategies and productivity initiatives as we continue to build our company. During 2011, we deployed $1.4 billion on nine acquisitions that added technology, opened new markets, and expanded geography in nearly all of our growth spaces. We also divested three businesses consistent with our strategy of focusing on our higher margin growth spaces. We received proceeds in excess of $500 million which we intend to utilize on future acquisitions or internal investments. Lastly, we generated $786 million in free cash flow, which enabled us to aggressively invest in higher growth economies and innovation, and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend, now standing at 56 consecutive years. As we concluded the fourth quarter, we encountered certain challenges, such as continued weakness in alternative energy, semi-conductor and telecom infrastructure markets and general softness within the European economy, including uncertainty around European credit markets, that may continue to impact our operations going into 2012. Despite these challenges, given our strong financial position and the depth and resilience of our business mix, we believe that through continued execution of our strategies around positioning ourselves to capitalize on global growth trends, capturing the benefits of common ownership and disciplined capital allocation, we are well positioned for solid growth in 2012. We expect 2012 full year organic growth to be in the range of 4% to 7% and acquisition related growth to be approximately 3% for acquisitions completed in 2011. Based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations, we expect our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2012 will be in the range of $4.70 to $5.00 and expect our earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters. 21 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we are reporting three businesses that were sold during the third and fourth quarters of 2011 as discontinued operations. Therefore, we have classified the results of operations of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Years Ended December 31, % / Point Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 versus 2010 2010 versus 2009 (Dollars in thousands except per share figures) Revenue $ 7,950,140 $ 6,640,191 $ 5,344,331 20 % 24 % Cost of goods and services 4,898,716 4,023,586 3,331,187 22 % 21 % Gross profit 3,051,424 2,616,605 2,013,144 17 % 30 % Selling and administrative expenses 1,840,609 1,607,327 1,422,015 15 % 13 % Restructuring - severance and exit costs 5,695 6,160 67,322 -8 % -91 % Interest expense, net 115,596 106,422 100,472 9 % 6 % Other expense (income), net 55 3,652 (3,752 ) - - Earnings from continuing operations 846,365 690,751 373,423 23 % 85 % Net earnings 895,243 700,104 356,438 28 % 96 % Net earnings per common share - diluted $ 4.74 $ 3.70 $ 1.91 28 % 94 % Gross profit margin 38.4 % 39.4 % 37.7 % (1.0 ) 1.7 Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 23.2 % 24.2 % 26.6 % (1.0 ) (2.4 ) Effective tax rate 22.7 % 23.2 % 24.5 % (0.5 ) (1.3 ) Revenue Our 2011 consolidated revenue increased $1.3 billion or 20% compared with 2010, reflecting organic growth of 11%, growth from acquisitions of 7% and a favorable impact from currency translation of 2%. The majority of our organic growth was attributed to increased volumes across all four segments driven by strength in the energy and consumer handset markets and solid growth in fluid solutions, refrigeration equipment and many of the industrial markets served by our Engineered Systems segment. Additionally, approximately 2% of our growth was generated by new products, particularly in our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments. Pricing added about 1% to revenue principally driven by strategic pricing initiatives and price increases implemented to offset higher commodity costs. Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 22% compared with 2010, with revenue generated in emerging economies of China and Latin America increasing 47%. Over 70% of the revenue growth from acquisitions was generated by Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions, two large acquisitions that we made in 2011 to expand our operations serving the artificial lift and handset markets, respectively. Our 2010 consolidated revenue increased $1.3 billion or 24% compared with 2009, reflecting organic revenue growth of 20%, growth from acquisitions of 4%, and a negligible unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The organic growth reflected volume increases across all four of our segments, driven by higher demand in the majority of our end-markets as the global economy continued to rebound in 2010 from the 2009 down cycle. Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 30% compared with 2009, with much of this growth generated in emerging economies of Asia and Latin America. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased $434.8 million or 17% in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes. However, gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue contracted 100 basis points in 2011 to 38.4% from 39.4% in 2010 due principally to the impact of product and customer mix, which more than offset operating leverage, as well as the impact of higher depreciation from recent acquisitions. Gross profit increased $603.5 million or 30% in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes. Gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was 39.4% in 2010, a 170 basis point improvement over the 2009 gross profit margin of 37.7%, reflecting the increase in sales volumes in 2010, the impact of lower restructuring charges on a comparative basis, and benefits realized from restructuring initiatives executed in 2009 along with our productivity initiatives. 22 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $233.3 million or 15% in 2011 compared with 2010 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses declined to 23.2% in 2011 compared with 24.2% in 2010. This 100 basis point improvement is largely a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels, which more than offset higher amortization and other nonrecurring expenses related to recent acquisitions. Selling and administrative expenses increased $185.3 million or 13% in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses declined to 24.2% in 2010 compared with 26.6% in 2009. This 240 basis point improvement reflects the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefits realized from 2009 restructuring efforts, as well as leverage from the higher revenue levels partially offset by increased compensation costs. Non-Operating Items Interest expense, net, increased 9% to $115.6 million in 2011 due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings during 2011 as compared with 2010. As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in February of 2011 we issued $800 million in new notes, receiving net proceeds of $789 million, approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire $400 million of notes which came due earlier that month, with the remainder used to fund first quarter acquisitions. As a result, our total borrowings were $380 million higher at the end of 2011 compared to the end of 2010. In 2010, interest expense, net, increased 6.0% to $106.4 million, primarily due to reduced interest income in 2010 resulting from lower interest rates on the Company short term investment balances. Other non-operating expense (income), net of $0.1 million in 2011 includes $8.6 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, offset by royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains, none of which are individually significant. Other non-operating expense, net of $3.7 million in 2010 reflects $6.9 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, coupled with a $4.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt, offset in part by royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains. This compares to other non-operating income, net of $3.8 million in 2009, which reflects $6.1 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, which was more than offset by a favorable insurance settlement and other miscellaneous non-operating gains. Income Taxes The 2011 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 22.7% compared to the 2010 rate of 23.2%. The effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable discrete and other items in both years (primarily driven by favorable audit settlements for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions relating to prior periods). The effective rate for 2011 was favorably impacted by net discrete items totaling $41.3 million, principally arising from settlements with the U.S. federal taxing authority and state taxing authorities. The effective tax rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling $50.3 million, arising principally from settlements with the U.S. federal taxing authority, coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter. The effective tax rate of 24.5% in 2009 was favorably impacted by $31.6 million of net benefits recognized for discrete items. Excluding these discrete and other items (a non-GAAP measure), the effective tax rate was 26.5% in 2011, 28.8% in 2010, and 30.9% in 2009, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, with the earnings generated in foreign markets typically taxed at lower rates than in the U.S. While we believe additional uncertain tax positions will be settled within the next twelve months, an estimate cannot be made due to the uncertainties associated with the resolution of these matters. 23 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings from continuing operations was $846.4 million in 2011, an increase of 23% compared to 2010 due mainly to the earnings on increased revenue and a lower effective tax rate. Net earnings from continuing operations were $690.8 million in 2010, an increase of 85% compared to 2009, mainly due to increased revenues, operating margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased to $48.9 million in 2011, primarily reflecting income of $53.6 million from the operations of the three businesses sold this year and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities, offset in part by a net loss on the sale of these businesses of $4.7 million, inclusive of goodwill impairment. In 2010, our net earnings from discontinued operations of $9.4 million includes income of $23.6 million from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 and adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities, offset in part by a net loss of approximately $14.2 million related to the sale of a business that had been reflected as a discontinued operation in a previous year. The 2009 net loss from discontinued operations of $17.0 million includes a net loss on sale of $11.2 million, mainly related to a write-down of a business held for sale, coupled with other net losses from operations totaling $5.8 million. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 increased 23% to $4.48 and diluted net earnings per share increased 28% to $4.74, as a result of the same factors discussed above. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2010 increased 83% to $3.65 and diluted net earnings per share increased 94% to $3.70, as a result of the same factors discussed above. Restructuring Activity We periodically undertake restructuring programs in response to prevailing business requirements and market conditions. In addition to these factors, 2009 earnings across all segments were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges, while 2011 and 2010 earnings reflect the benefits captured from the businesses restructuring and integration programs initiated in 2008 and 2009. In late 2008, we launched various synergy capture programs and restructuring initiatives in response to the weakening global economic environment at the time. In 2008 and 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $23.9 million and $67.3 million, respectively, relating to these programs. These programs were largely executed throughout 2009, and we realized incremental savings of approximately $125 million and $32 million in 2009 and 2010, respectively. During 2009, we had a net reduction in our workforce of approximately 2,950, or 9%, and a net reduction of 23 manufacturing and warehouse facilities, as a result of these strategic restructuring efforts. By 2010, we had completed the majority of the initiatives launched in 2008 and 2009. In 2010 and 2011, our businesses were generally expanding their operations, so our restructuring activities were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations. We incurred restructuring charges of $6.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively, relating to such activities. We do not currently anticipate significant restructuring activity in 2012, but will continue to monitor business activity across our end markets and adjust capacity as necessary depending on the economic climate and other internal business factors. 24 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As discussed previously, in the fourth quarter of 2011 we reorganized our businesses into four new segments to better align with our key end-markets. As such, the information herein has been recast to conform to the new segment structure for all periods presented. See Note 1 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenue, earnings and operating margin to our consolidated revenue, earnings from continuing operations, and operating margin. Communication Technologies Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 1,360,077 $ 1,076,012 $ 916,031 26.4 % 17.5 % Segment earnings $ 226,382 $ 205,215 $ 142,541 10.3 % 44.0 % Operating margin 16.6 % 19.1 % 15.6 % Other measures: Depreciation and amortization $ 101,839 $ 72,262 $ 69,393 40.9 % 4.1 % Bookings 1,344,540 1,128,265 952,346 19.2 % 18.5 % Backlog 437,320 404,374 337,833 8.1 % 19.7 % Components of revenue growth: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Organic growth 7.2 % 17.0 % Acquisitions 18.0 % 0.6 % Foreign currency translation 1.2 % -0.1 % 26.4 % 17.5 % 2011 Versus 2010 Revenue generated by our Communication Technologies segment increased $284.1 million, or 26%, compared with 2010, with $190.2 million, or 18% of the growth, attributed principally to the 2011 acquisition of Sound Solutions, which supplements our product offerings in the growing handset market. Although there was an incremental decrease in revenue due to normal pricing concessions for our communication and telecommunication products corresponding to normal product life cycle maturities, this decrease was more than offset by revenue growth from market share gains, new product introductions and product mix. Our organic revenue growth of 7% was largely due to continued strong demand for smart phones serving the communications market which grew significantly year over year. Our revenue in the communications market (representing 31% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $66.6 million, or 42%, excluding Sound Solutions. Our microelectronic mechanical ( MEMs ) microphones and SiSonic technologies were well positioned to capitalize on this market's growth as we have continued to invest in capacity to meet the growing market demands. We also experienced solid demand in the commercial aerospace market due to increased build rates of commercial aircraft by leading aircraft manufactures and increased demand for our aftermarket products globally. Our aerospace/industrial revenue (18% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $59.0 million, or 32%. This overall growth was partially offset by weakened demand in the global telecom markets, driven in part by deferred industry investment due to service provider consolidation. This contributed to a decrease of $7.2 million, or 3%, in our telecommunication/other revenue (17% of 2011 segment revenue). Revenue derived from our defense market (16% of 2011 segment revenue) declined $8.2 million, or 4%, mainly due to timing and funding of certain programs. Our life sciences revenue (18% of segment revenue) also declined by $16.4 million, or 6%, principally due to softer hearing aid demand in the first half of 2011 and overall softer medical equipment demand. Communication Technologies 2011 earnings increased 10% compared with 2010, but operating margin declined 250 basis points. The margin decline mainly resulted from higher acquisition related costs including incremental depreciation and amortization, higher raw material costs, and lower margins from the integration of the Sound Solutions acquisition. Excluding the impact of Sound Solutions, earnings would have increased by $36.6 million, or 18%, and operating margin would have increased by 160 basis points as compared with 2010. Bookings and backlog at the end of 2011 indicate continued strength in the handset and aerospace markets as we head into 2012, offset by continued softness in the telecommunication market. 2010 Versus 2009 Communication Technologies 2010 revenue and earnings increased 18% and 44%, respectively, compared with 2009. The increase in revenues was supported by organic revenue growth of 17% and growth from acquisitions of 1%, offset by a negligible impact from foreign currency translation. The organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong demand for MEMs microphones, hearing aid components and telecom infrastructure related products. Earnings and operating margin in 2010 were favorably impacted by higher sales volume and production leverage, coupled with the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefit of 2009 restructuring programs. 25 Table of Contents Energy Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 1,900,749 $ 1,303,507 $ 998,272 45.8 % 30.6 % Segment earnings $ 450,637 $ 316,113 $ 211,962 42.6 % 49.1 % Operating margin 23.7 % 24.3 % 21.2 % Other measures: Segment depreciation and amortization $ 77,819 $ 48,842 $ 40,349 59.3 % 21.0 % Bookings 1,985,405 1,319,015 974,886 50.5 % 35.3 % Backlog 246,351 152,183 123,367 61.9 % 23.4 % Components of revenue growth: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Organic growth 26.2 % 24.7 % Acquisitions 18.5 % 4.7 % Foreign currency translation 1.1 % 1.2 % 45.8 % 30.6 % 2011 Versus 2010 Our Energy segment posted record organic revenue, earnings and bookings in 2011. Revenue and earnings were up 46% and 43%, respectively, due to continued strength in the drilling, production and downstream energy markets served by the segment. Recent acquisitions generated revenue growth of 19% and contributed to the segment record results. Sales outside of North America grew 35% driven by significantly higher sales to Central and South America, the Middle East and Russia. Pricing actions, generally undertaken to offset commodity inflation, accounted for a marginal portion of the revenue increase. Production sector revenue (representing 51% of 2011 segment revenue) increased 72%, with 35% due to organic growth and 37% from acquisitions. The organic growth was driven by higher drilling and well completion activity, increased international sales, and higher demand for winch products serving the energy, infrastructure and recovery markets. Drilling sector revenue (21% of 2011 segment revenue) grew 34% due to increased exploration activity, pricing, and market share increases. Our revenues in the drilling and production sectors are impacted by changes in the number of active North American drilling rigs. The average North American drilling rig count in 2011 was up 21% over the prior year, driven by strong oil prices. Downstream sector revenue (28% of 2011 segment revenue) was up 20%, with 14% from organic revenue growth and the balance from recent acquisitions. The organic growth reflects continued strong demand for products in the power generation, rail, cargo tank and chemical/industrial markets, as well as nozzles and hanging hardware for retail fueling stations. Energy earnings increased $134.5 million, or 43%, from the higher organic and acquisition volumes. Energy operating margin declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year, due to the impact of acquisition-related costs, including higher depreciation and amortization, and higher material costs, partially offset by improved operating leverage associated with the higher volumes, strategic pricing and productivity gains. Both bookings and backlog at the end of December increased significantly compared to the prior year, and we expect market conditions in 2012 to continue to be favorable for the Energy segment. The market compression of natural gas prices should not have a significant impact to our operations, as we expect the effects of the migration away from dry gas to be offset by increased oil and liquid rich gas activity. 2010 Versus 2009 Our Energy segment 2010 revenue and earnings increased 31% and 49%, respectively, compared with 2009. Organic revenue growth of 25% was driven by a significant increase in active North American drilling rigs and market share gains in our drilling sector businesses. Increased drilling activity also favorably impacted our businesses in the production sector, particularly demand for sucker rods. The average North American drilling rig count in 2010 was up 45% compared to 2009. The 2009 Inpro/Seal acquisition contributed revenue growth of approximately 5%, and foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenue by 1%. The increase in earnings is the result of higher sales volume and benefits from productivity improvements and 2009 restructuring initiatives. 26 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue Refrigeration & Industrial $ 2,424,638 $ 2,219,844 $ 1,807,283 9.2 % 22.8 % Fluid Solutions 677,621 567,914 492,191 19.3 % 15.4 % Eliminations (1,524 ) (1,316 ) (893 ) $ 3,100,735 $ 2,786,442 $ 2,298,581 11.3 % 21.2 % Segment earnings $ 445,186 $ 382,644 $ 280,346 16.3 % 36.5 % Operating margin 14.4 % 13.7 % 12.2 % Other measures: Segment depreciation and amortization $ 74,776 $ 72,526 $ 68,992 3.1 % 5.1 % Bookings Refrigeration & Industrial $ 2,512,706 $ 2,291,896 $ 1,757,916 9.6 % 30.4 % Fluid Solutions 682,832 573,886 481,149 19.0 % 19.3 % Eliminations (2,816 ) (2,412 ) (1,109 ) $ 3,192,722 $ 2,863,370 $ 2,237,956 11.5 % 27.9 % Backlog Refrigeration & Industrial $ 528,118 $ 446,267 $ 373,938 18.3 % 19.3 % Fluid Solutions 54,194 47,123 41,496 15.0 % 13.6 % Eliminations (177 ) (315 ) (115 ) $ 582,135 $ 493,075 $ 415,319 18.1 % 18.7 % Components of revenue growth: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Organic growth 9.4 % 15.8 % Acquisitions and divestitures, net 0.6 % 6.0 % Foreign currency translation 1.3 % -0.6 % 11.3 % 21.2 % 2011 Versus 2010 Engineered Systems 2011 revenue increased 11%, driven by organic revenue growth of 9%, favorable foreign currency of 1% and a negligible impact from recent acquisitions. Revenue of our refrigeration & industrial platform, which serves our refrigeration and food equipment, waste and recycling, and other industrial end-markets, increased $205 million, or 9%. Revenue from refrigeration and food equipment (representing 35% of 2011 segment revenue) increased $91 million, or 9%, reflecting strong demand for refrigeration systems fueled by remodel activity at major retail chains. Performance by our businesses serving the waste and recycling and other industrial markets (43% of 2011 segment revenue) was driven by increased global demand for industrial automation machinery, improving demand for vehicle services in the important Asian markets and a market rebound in hydraulic equipment due in part to strength in the mining sector, partially offset by a double-digit decline in waste and recycling revenue given continued constraints on municipal spending. These factors combined to increase other industrial revenue by $114 million, or 9%. Revenue of our fluid solutions platform (22% of 2011 segment revenue) increased by $110 million, or 19%, reflecting strong demand for pumps in the chemical, transport and hygienic markets and increasing demand for heat exchange systems, coupled with the benefits from geographic expansion, particularly in Asia, and price increases necessary to cover rising commodity costs. Engineered Systems segment earnings increased $62.5 million, or 16%, on the strength of increased volume. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points, as a result of positive pricing actions and productivity savings, which more than offset cost escalation and unfavorable product mix. Bookings and backlog at the end of 2011 have increased compared to 2010 levels, driven by higher refrigeration, pump and heat exchange orders. We continue to invest in market leading technologies to better serve the refrigeration market, as we expect more economies to propose and pass carbon-limiting legislation in the coming years. An example of this is our fourth quarter acquisition of Advansor A/S, which manufactures energy efficient transcritical CO 2 systems used in refrigeration systems. 2010 Versus 2009 Our Engineered Systems 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 21% and 37%, respectively, as compared with 2009. Organic revenue growth of 16% was driven by higher sales volumes in refrigeration systems and vehicle service offerings, offset in part by softness in waste and recycling markets. Earnings and margin were favorably impacted by increased volumes in high margin businesses, the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits associated with 2009 restructuring initiatives. 27 Table of Contents Printing & Identification Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 1,592,964 $ 1,476,830 $ 1,133,499 7.9 % 30.3 % Segment earnings $ 226,534 $ 237,368 $ 78,026 -4.6 % 204.2 % Operating margin 14.2 % 16.1 % 6.9 % Other measures: Segment depreciation and amortization $ 46,148 $ 46,302 $ 51,532 -0.3 % -10.1 % Bookings 1,562,719 1,573,044 1,157,242 -0.7 % 35.9 % Backlog 180,871 213,589 117,734 -15.3 % 81.4 % Components of revenue growth: 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Organic growth 4.8 % 30.5 % Acquisitions 0.0 % 0.8 % Foreign currency translation 3.1 % -1.0 % 7.9 % 30.3 % 2011 Versus 2010 Our Printing & Identification segment 2011 revenue increased 8% compared with 2010, with 5% of the increase attributed to higher organic and new product volumes and 3% from favorable foreign currency impacts. Price was slightly favorable, offsetting commodity inflation. Electronics revenue (representing 42% of 2011 segment revenue) was up 11% versus the prior year, with strong first half growth of 50% driven by strong demand in the alternative energy and semiconductor markets, partially offset by a revenue decline in the second half of 17% as demand weakened in these same electronic markets. Additionally, we realized volume growth in our fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) (35% of 2011 segment revenue) and industrial products (23% of 2011 segment revenue), with combined 6% revenue growth year over year, driven by successful new product introductions that gained traction as the year progressed. Printing & Identification earnings declined $11 million in 2011, resulting in an operating margin decline of 190 basis points. The margin decline is primarily attributed to the second half reduction in alternative energy and semiconductor revenues which are typically higher margin activity, coupled with unfavorable regional mix due to weaker European markets for our FMCG, and key strategic investments for growth directed toward our FMCG, industrial and electronics end markets. We expect these investments to continue into 2012 as we consider these end markets integral to our longer-term revenue growth focus. We also completed several small employee reduction in force programs across targeted businesses to streamline operations and to align more closely with our growth in geographic end markets. Costs related to these programs were not significant. Year-end 2011 bookings and backlog levels are down from the prior year, primarily due to the slowdown in electronics end markets, particularly alternative energy and semiconductor. We currently expect these market conditions to continue through the first half of 2012. 2010 Versus 2009 Our Printing & Identification segment 2010 revenue increased by 30% compared with 2009, substantially driven by increased demand in all of its major product categories, including marking and coding and electronic assembly and board test equipment. Demand was fueled by the economic recovery, increased semiconductor handling business, and growth in solar/alternative energy products. Earnings in 2010 increased over 200% compared with 2009 primarily due to the favorable impact of product and geographic mix, the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits of 2009 restructuring initiatives. 28 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions, while managing our capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash Flow Summary The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Years Ended Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations (in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 1,058,229 $ 901,862 $ 743,381 Investing activities (1,020,940 ) (171,518 ) (252,184 ) Financing activities (50,501 ) (304,788 ) (388,453 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased $156.4 million, primarily due to increased net earnings in 2011 and reduced investment in working capital relative to 2010. Higher sales volume increased 2011 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $256 million as compared with 2010. Our investment in working capital was $151 million lower than in 2010, at which time a working capital build-up was necessary to support revenue levels recovering from the 2009 declines. These increases in cash flow were partially offset by $178 million of higher income tax payments resulting from our higher earnings and 2011 tax settlement activity, as well as higher employee incentive compensation payments and reductions in deferred revenue. Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased $158.5 million from 2009. Higher sales volume increased 2010 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $354 million as compared with 2009. This was offset by a $220 million increase in working capital necessary to support the increase in 2010 order and revenue levels, compared to a $179 million decrease in working capital in the 2009 period when sales levels had declined. Other factors contributing to the 2010 increase in operating cash flows included $49 million less in restructuring payments, $21 million less of post-retirement plan contributions, and a $54 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional sales activity in the 2010 period. Postretirement costs relating to pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans affect results in all segments. We recorded net periodic benefit cost of $40 million, $33 million and $37 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit, supplemental and post-retirement plans). The main drivers of expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including expected returns on plan assets, the service cost and the interest cost. In 2011, the actual return on U.S. plan assets increased, while returns on our non-U.S. plan assets declined, as a result of the different mix of investments in the plans. In 2010, the actual return on plan assets increased, consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets. In 2012, we expect our net periodic benefit cost to be approximately $48 million, with the increase compared to 2011 being attributed to higher amortization relating to unrecognized losses. The funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates. We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. At December 31, 2011, the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit plans reflected underfunding by $75 million, which includes $12 million relating to the U.S. Dover Corporate Pension Plan and $63 million relating to our significant international pension plans, some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund the plans due to local regulations. The majority of the international obligations relate to defined pension plans operated by our businesses in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $49 million, $38 million and $51 million, respectively. In 2012, we expect to contribute $20 to $40 million to our qualified defined benefit plans. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our post-retirement plans. Adjusted Working Capital In 2011, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from 2010 by $207 million, or 17%, to $1.4 billion, which reflected an increase in receivables of $167 million, an increase in net inventory of $145 million and an increase in accounts payable of $105 million, generally due to additional working capital investment necessary to support the increased revenue levels and the impact of 2011 acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of $16 million, Adjusted Working Capital would have increased by $63 million, or 5%. 29 Table of Contents Investing Activities We used cash for investing activities of $1.0 billion in 2011 and $171.5 million in 2010, mainly for capital spending and acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of businesses. In 2011, our use of cash for investing activities also included a net payment of $18 million on the settlement of foreign exchange forward contracts which had served as hedges of a portion of our euro-denominated net investment. Acquisitions . In 2011, we used cash of $1.4 billion to acquire nine businesses, including $401 million for Harbison-Fischer in the first quarter and $824 million for Sound Solutions in the third quarter. In comparison, we used $104 million to acquire six businesses in 2010. Capital spending . Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $271 million in 2011 and $175 million in 2010. The increase in 2011 capital spending reflects investment in capacity expansion within our businesses principally serving the high-growth energy drilling and handset markets. In 2011, our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue were approximately 3.4%. We expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in 2012 to increase slightly, driven by capacity expansion to support our high-growth, high-demand energy and handset markets . Proceeds from sales of businesses. We generated cash of $517 million in 2011, primarily from the sale of Paladin Brands, Crenlo and Heil Trailer International, three businesses that had operated in our Engineered Systems segment. This compares to net proceeds of $4.5 million generated by the sale of Triton in 2010. Short-term investments. We typically invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments. In 2011, we generated net proceeds of $124 million from the sale of short-term investments, which were used to fund a portion of the Sound Solutions acquisition. In 2010, our short-term investment activity generated net proceeds of $87 million. We anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make in 2012 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds, and if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper or through public debt markets. Financing Activities We used cash for financing activities of $50.5 million in 2011 and $304.8 million in 2010, mainly for purchase of our common stock and payment of dividends, largely offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options. Long-term and short-term debt . In 2011, we realized net proceeds of $789 million from the 4.3% 10-year Notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year Notes due 2041 issued in February, approximately half of which was used to repay $400 million of other borrowings, principally commercial paper used to repay the 6.50% 10-year Notes which came due earlier in February 2011 and to fund acquisitions made in the first quarter. Treasury purchases . We historically repurchase shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements, and expect to continue with this policy. We used $242 million for share repurchases in 2011 compared with $124 million in 2010. During 2011, we repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market, pursuant to the 10,000,000 share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in May 2007. In 2010, we purchased approximately 2.3 million shares under the same program. Approximately 2.5 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this 10,000,000 five year authorization as of December 31, 2011. Dividend payments . Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $219 million in 2011 and $200 million in 2010. Our dividends per common share increased 10% to $1.18 per share in 2011 compared to $1.07 per share in 2010. This represents the 56 th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. Proceeds from exercise of stock options . We received $40 million from employee exercises of stock options in 2011, compared to $80 million in 2010. Since 2006, we have issued only stock-settled appreciation rights ( SARs ), and a greater portion of our 2011 exercise activity was related to SARs which do not require cash settlement. 30 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Free Cash Flow In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase our common stock. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. The following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities: Years Ended Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 1,058,229 $ 901,862 $ 743,381 Less: Capital expenditures (271,809 ) (174,845 ) (112,972 ) Free cash flow $ 786,420 $ 727,017 $ 630,409 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 9.9 % 10.9 % 11.8 % For 2011, we generated free cash flow of $786.4 million, representing 9.9% of revenue and 92.9% of earnings from continuing operations, while continuing to make investments necessary to support our growth. Free cash flow in 2010 was $727.0 million or 10.9% of revenue, compared to $630.4 million or 11.8% of revenue in 2009. The full year increase in 2011 free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower investment in working capital, partially offset by higher tax payments in 2011. In 2011, we made tax payments of approximately $281 million compared to $103 million in the prior year, with the 2011 increase resulting from the higher level of earnings, the timing of estimated payments, and the impact of certain changes in federal tax regulations. Free cash flow is also impacted by higher capital expenditures in 2011 necessary to fund expansion in our high-growth businesses. We expect to generate free cash flow in 2012 of approximately 10% of revenue, consistent with our historical performance. The 2010 increase in free cash flow compared to 2009 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations offset by investment in working capital and an increase in capital expenditures. The 90 basis point decline in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was the result of the significant reduction in working capital realized in 2009 coupled with lower revenue levels. Net Debt to Net Capitalization We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: At December 31, Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Current maturities of long-term debt $ 1,022 $ 1,590 $ 35,624 Commercial paper - 15,000 - Long-term debt 2,186,230 1,790,886 1,825,260 Total debt 2,187,252 1,807,476 1,860,884 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (1,206,755 ) (1,310,813 ) (940,245 ) Net debt 980,497 496,663 920,639 Add: Stockholders' equity 4,930,555 4,526,562 4,083,608 Net capitalization $ 5,911,052 $ 5,023,225 $ 5,004,247 Net debt to net capitalization 16.6 % 9.9 % 18.4 % Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at December 31, 2011 primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling $1.4 billion during the year. Total borrowings increased by $380 million during 2011, primarily due to $789 million net proceeds received from the 4.3% 10-year Notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year Notes due 2041 issued in February, approximately half of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances incurred to retire $400 million of notes which came due earlier in February 2011. In 2011, we also received cash proceeds of $517 million, primarily from the sale of three businesses. 31 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion, representing a decrease of $104 million, as compared with the 2010 balance including short-term investments. Cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less. We regularly invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months, up to twelve months. We held no short-term investments at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, our total cash and cash equivalents included $600 million held outside of the United States. We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. In November of 2011, we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks to replace our existing facility that was set to expire in November 2012. Our new facility permits borrowings up to $1 billion, which is consistent with the facility we replaced, and expires on November 10, 2016. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for our commercial paper program. We have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so. If we were to draw down a loan, at our election, the loan would bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.565% to 1.225% (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody s) or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility. Under this facility, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. We were in compliance with this covenant and our other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2011 and had a coverage ratio of 14.3 to 1. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC with remaining capacity of $1 billion that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. At December 31, 2011, we have an outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million. In February 2011, we amended and restated the terms of the arrangement to extend its maturity date to October 15, 2015. This transaction continues to hedge a portion of our net investment in CHF-denominated operations. The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and the effective portion of the change in fair value is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings. The fair value at December 31, 2011 reflected a loss of $21.7 million due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement. In January 2011, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to purchase $350 million for 258.7 million, which were designated as hedging an equivalent amount of our euro denominated net investment. The agreements qualified as net investment hedges with the changes in fair value being reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings. These arrangements were settled on April 4, 2011, at which time we realized a loss of $18.2 million, which is reported within the cumulative translation adjustment. Our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. Our credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were as follows as of December 31, 2011: Short Term Rating Long Term Rating Outlook Moody's P-1 A2 Stable Standard & Poor's A-1 A Stable Fitch F1 A Stable We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $59.9 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in 2012 through 2016. These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which we believe is remote. We have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. We do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities. 32 Table of Contents A summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Other (4) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,187,252 $ 1,022 $ 523 $ 299,248 $ 1,886,459 $ - Interest expense (2) 1,934,370 117,788 235,575 217,903 1,363,104 - Rental commitments 245,077 62,948 80,939 39,845 61,345 - Purchase obligations 57,202 46,853 9,788 561 - - Capital leases 5,345 1,606 1,796 904 1,039 - Supplemental & post-retirement benefits (3) 167,580 19,992 21,469 48,389 77,730 - Uncertain tax positions (4) 184,467 1,576 - - - 182,891 Total obligations $ 4,781,293 $ 251,785 $ 350,090 $ 606,850 $ 3,389,677 $ 182,891 _________ (1) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts represent total long-term debt, including current maturities. (2) Amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long-term debt using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2011. (3) Amounts represent estimated benefit payments under our supplemental and post-retirement benefit plans. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also expect to contribute approximately $20 to $40 million to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2012, which amount is not reflected in the above table. (4) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, we are unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2012. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1. The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis. Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 10% of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed. In limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized. We do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements. Inventory for the majority of our subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by us to properly value inventory. Businesses within our Communication Technologies and Printing & Identification segments tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. 33 Table of Contents We have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Our assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or, when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, or when a significant portion of a reporting unit is to be reclassified to discontinued operations, during the interim periods. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses (i.e. an income approach) which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability. Changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. No goodwill impairment was indicated by the testing of our 17 identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value by at least 30% and, in most cases, significantly more. If the fair value of each of the reporting units was decreased by 10%, the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized. The valuation of our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. Annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. As disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2011 weighted-average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit, supplemental and other post-retirement obligations ranged from 4.45% to 4.85%, reduced from the 2010 rates, which ranged from 5.04% to 5.50%. The reduced discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market interest rates over these periods. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately $32.3 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2011. Our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately $1.5 million. We have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. We routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves. Reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and our future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes. We have significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of our risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, our experience and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience. We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. While we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. Occasionally, we will establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. 34 Table of Contents We will from time to time discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, including goodwill, to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar-type entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. We are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance share awards. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SARs and stock options granted to employees. The model requires that we estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data. We use the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also require us to estimate the volatility of our stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of our peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2009-13, which amended existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. We adopted the multiple element guidance of ASU 2009-13 effective January 1, 2011. We do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements, so the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-14 which eliminates tangible products containing both software and non-software components that operate together to deliver a product functionality from the scope of then-current generally accepted accounting principles for software. We adopted ASU 2009-14 on a prospective basis, effective January 1, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU only requires a change in the format of the current presentation. We adopted this guidance for our 2011 year-end reporting, presenting other comprehensive earnings in a separate statement following the statement of earnings. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09 which requires enhanced disclosures around an employer participation in multiemployer pension plans. The standard is intended to provide more information about an employer financial obligations to a multiemployer pension plan to help financial statement users better understand the financial health of the significant plans in which the employer participates. This guidance became effective for our fiscal 2011 year-end reporting. Its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 which was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2012. Its adoption is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. However, an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard, provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we also disclose non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total debt, net capitalization, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, earnings, revenue or working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe the (1) net debt to net capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase our common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. We believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes, given the global nature of our businesses. We believe that reporting organic or core revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.
