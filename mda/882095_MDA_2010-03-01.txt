ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors ). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Australia. We market products in the HIV/AIDS, liver diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular/metabolic therapeutic areas. Our products comprise Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B; AmBisome (amphotericin B liposome for injection) for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Ranexa (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina; Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection and Cayston (aztreonam for inhalation solution) as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ). F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment and prevention of influenza under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Eyetech Inc. markets Macugen (pegaptanib sodium injection) in the United States and Europe for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Volibris (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa outside of the United States under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan (regadenoson) injection in the United States for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Business Highlights During 2009, we grew our business significantly and achieved record total revenues of $7.01 billion while strengthening our product portfolio and pipeline programs. Our commercial achievements for 2009 comprised the continued rollout of Atripla in the European Union including the launch of Atripla in France, the growth of Atripla and Truvada product sales in the United States and Canada, making gains in the PAH market with Letairis, as well as continuing the expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure. We grew our product sales significantly and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure to support our expanded international footprint and business activities. In addition, we added Ranexa to our product portfolio through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) in April 2009. In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa . Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009. Cayston is delivered via a specific inhalation device developed by PARI Pharma GmbH. 44 Table of Contents We also made significant advances on the compounds and product candidates in our research and development (R&D) pipeline, including: In the HIV area, in January 2010, we announced that both of the Phase 2 clinical studies of cobicistat (formerly GS 9350), our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain HIV medicines, and a complete single-tablet fixed-dose regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat and Truvada in treatment-na ve patients met their primary objectives of non-inferiority. Pending discussion with the FDA, we expect to initiate three Phase 3 studies before the middle of 2010: two studies for the single-tablet fixed-dose regimen mentioned above and one study for cobicistat. In December 2009, we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 study evaluating elvitegravir in treatment-experienced patients. In addition, in collaboration with Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec), we are developing a new once-daily fixed-dose combination containing our Truvada and Tibotec investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine hydrochloride), which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. Subject to positive outcome of this study, we intend to submit marketing applications for the fixed-dose combination of Truvada and TMC278 in the United States and Europe during the second half of 2010. In the liver disease area, we completed the Phase 2a studies of GS 9450, the caspase inhibitor we licensed from LG Life Sciences, Ltd. in 2007, that is in development for the treatment of hepatitis C and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and expect to present the results in the second quarter of 2010. We are continuing the Phase 2b study of GS 9450 for the treatment of hepatitis C. We are also continuing our Phase 2 study of GS 9190, a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, and expect to complete the study in the second half of 2010. In the cardiovascular and metabolic areas, we expanded our product candidate portfolio through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. We anticipate commencing patient enrollment in a Phase 2 study of ranolazine for the treatment of diastolic heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction in the second quarter of 2010. We are continuing our Phase 3 study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We are also collaborating with GSK to develop a clinical trial to study combination therapy versus monotherapy in a first-line treatment setting for PAH. The study, AMBITION, will evaluate first-line combination use with ambrisentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, in patients with PAH. We are continuing our Phase 2 study of cicletanine hydrochloride, an oral agent in development for the treatment of PAH. We announced plans to terminate development of darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension after our second Phase 3 study of the compound failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. In May 2009, we announced that our marketing authorization application for regadenoson, an investigational pharmacologic stress agent for radionuclide MPI, was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). Following validation of the marketing authorization application, the dossier is distributed to members of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for formal review to determine whether regadenoson is a safe and efficacious pharmacologic stress agent in humans. In the respiratory area, we are continuing the Phase 3 study of ambrisentan for the treatment of IPF and anticipate completing enrollment of patients in this study by the end of 2010. We are continuing the Phase 2 study of GS 9310/11, an inhaled co-formulation of fosfomycin and tobramycin, for the treatment of bacterial infections associated with CF, the Phase 2 study of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis and the Phase 1 study of GS 9411, an oral epithelial sodium channel blocker designed to increase airway hydration for the treatment of pulmonary disease. Acquisition of CV Therapeutics and Restructuring In April 2009, we completed the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, a publicly-held biopharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, California, primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. CV Therapeutics 45 Table of Contents had two marketed products as well as several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. We believe the acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to further expand into the cardiovascular therapeutic area. We adopted the new business combinations guidance for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree and applied it to the CV Therapeutics acquisition. As a result, we recognized consideration transferred of $1.39 billion and recorded $951.2 million and $138.9 million in intangible assets relating to marketed products and in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects, respectively, which constituted a significant portion of the assets acquired from CV Therapeutics. The results of operations of CV Therapeutics beginning on April 15, 2009, the acquisition date, were included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies between CV Therapeutics and us, re-align our cardiovascular operations and eliminate certain redundancies. The restructuring plan included consolidation and re-alignment of the cardiovascular R&D organization, our exit from certain facilities and the termination of certain contractual obligations. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded $26.2 million and $25.7 million in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, in 2009, primarily related to employee severance, relocation and termination benefits, lease termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. We expect to incur an additional $20.2 million in 2010 bringing the total amount to be incurred in connection with the significant activities of our restructuring plan to be approximately $38.8 million for employee severance, relocation and termination benefits and $33.3 million for facilities-related expenses. Financial Highlights Our operating results for the year were led by total product sales of $6.47 billion. Antiviral product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva) increased 25% to $5.84 billion in 2009 from $4.67 billion in 2008, and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of 27% for 2009 as compared to 2008. With the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States and Europe, Atripla contributed $2.38 billion, or 41%, to our total 2009 antiviral product sales. The growth of Atripla product sales and its increased proportion to overall product sales caused total product gross margin to decrease to 75% in 2009 from 78% in 2008, due primarily to the efavirenz component of Atripla sales at zero gross margin. Truvada product sales for 2009 comprised $2.49 billion, or 43% of our total 2009 antiviral product sales. Truvada product sales for 2009 increased 18% from 2008 primarily due to continued sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2009 had an unfavorable impact of approximately $98.5 million on total revenues and $33.6 million on pre-tax income when compared to 2008. Royalty revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $491.8 million in 2009, an increase of 125% from royalty revenues of $218.2 million in 2008. The increase in royalty revenues was due primarily to increased Tamiflu sales by Roche related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Operating expenses increased $825.0 million in 2009, or 31%, compared to 2008, reflecting the increased research and clinical study activity in our development pipeline, our expanded commercial activities worldwide, as well as the higher headcount, infrastructure and technology-related costs required to support the continued growth of our business. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $665.2 million during the year, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $3.08 billion partially offset by cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of $245.4 million, and $998.5 million used to repurchase approximately 21.8 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases under the now completed $3.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) in October 2007. 46 Table of Contents 2010 Outlook Our operating objectives for 2010 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. From a commercial standpoint, we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, we expect a favorable impact from our updated Atripla label that includes data from Study 073 supporting switching patients from other HIV regimens to Atripla, revised U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines that recommend earlier treatment for patients with HIV and the extension of the Ryan White Treatment Act which should provide stable funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs in the United States through 2013. In the hepatitis B virus (HBV) area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on Asian communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care. As part of those efforts, we will have a larger hepatitis B field team in 2010 in the United States. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the PAH and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of Letairis and Ranexa in 2010. We are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: the potential healthcare reform in the United States, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these factors and will adjust our business processes to mitigate these risks to our business. The successes we experienced in 2009 have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial, collaborative and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2010. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer 47 Table of Contents incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by the company being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, U.S government rebates of $885.5 million, $625.0 million and $423.3 million, respectively, representing 12%, 10% and 10% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $242.9 million and $173.4 million, respectively, in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $41.8 million and $32.8 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance at Beginning of Year Charged to Expense Deducted from Accruals Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2009: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2009 sales $ $ 878,593 $ 594,579 $ 284,014 Activity related to sales prior to 2009 206,273 6,902 212,547 628 Total $ 206,273 $ 885,495 $ 807,126 $ 284,642 Year ended December 31, 2008: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2008 sales $ $ 627,935 $ 424,298 $ 203,637 Activity related to sales prior to 2008 139,370 (2,965 ) 133,769 2,636 Total $ 139,370 $ 624,970 $ 558,067 $ 206,273 Intangible Assets In conjunction with business combinations that we have completed, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets, such as those 48 Table of Contents related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2009, we had $601.5 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $462.6 million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $138.9 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Of the $138.9 million of IPR&D intangible assets that we acquired from CV Therapeutics, $93.4 million related to GS 9667 (formerly CVT-3619), a product candidate in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The remaining balance of the intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects represented various other in-process projects with no single project comprising a significant portion of the total value. The estimated fair value of the IPR&D intangible assets acquired from CV Therapeutics was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using a present value discount rate of 9%, which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of CV Therapeutics. This is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for CV Therapeutics operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. We compensated for the differing phases of development of each project by probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each project. We then determined the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 9%. The projected cash flows from the IPR&D projects were based on various estimates and assumptions including those noted above. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan product, which we also acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a 49 Table of Contents straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and we will have limited ongoing access and visibility into that partner future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate utilizing a forecasted product sales approach. As of December 31, 2009, we had $923.3 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $245.0 million and $275.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $29.9 million, $31.8 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 50 Table of Contents Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred CRO costs of $109.9 million, $111.8 million and $65.6 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2009, 2008 and 2007 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Ranexa. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2009, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in 2009 and 2008 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in a credit to goodwill of approximately $8.0 million for 2008 and an income tax benefit of approximately $14.0 million and $15.5 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. 51 Table of Contents At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $119.3 million, respectively, including interest of $5.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $74.7 million and $111.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. In 2009, we reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007. We also amended our California income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the IRS. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $76.2 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2003 and onward. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Stock-based Compensation We measure all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on their relative fair values. Fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life. Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for non-vested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation expenses related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual 52 Table of Contents forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our Consolidated Statements of Income rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized stock-based compensation expenses of $185.8 million, $153.4 million and $184.6 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $11.4 million, $9.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2009, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $347.4 million related to non-vested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.7 years. Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $7.01 billion in 2009, $5.34 billion in 2008 and $4.23 billion in 2007. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. Product Sales The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Antiviral products: Truvada $ 2,489,682 18 % $ 2,106,687 33 % $ 1,589,229 Atripla 2,382,113 51 % 1,572,455 74 % 903,381 Viread 667,510 7 % 621,187 1 % 613,169 Hepsera 271,595 (20 )% 341,023 13 % 302,722 Emtriva 27,974 (10 )% 31,080 (1 )% 31,493 Total antiviral products 5,838,874 25 % 4,672,432 36 % 3,439,994 AmBisome 298,597 3 % 289,651 10 % 262,571 Letairis 183,949 63 % 112,855 437 % 21,020 Ranexa 131,062 Other 16,829 71 % 9,858 4 % 9,524 Total product sales $ 6,469,311 27 % $ 5,084,796 36 % $ 3,733,109 Total product sales increased by 27% in 2009 compared to 2008 and by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales including the strong growth of Atripla sales as well as the continued growth of Truvada sales. Foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net loss from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar of approximately $98.5 million for 2009 compared to 2008, and a net benefit from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar of approximately $148.2 million for 2008 compared to 2007. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 53 Table of Contents Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased 25% in 2009 compared to 2008 and by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Atripla and Truvada. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was also due to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada Truvada sales increased by 18% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2008 compared to 2007 driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales accounted for 43%, 45% and 46% of our total antiviral product sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Atripla Atripla sales increased by 51% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. The European growth benefited from the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales increased by 74% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States, as well as launches of the product in most European countries. Atripla sales include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $880.7 million, $576.0 million and $334.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 41%, 34% and 26% of our total antiviral product sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other Antiviral Products Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva decreased by 3% for 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume decreases in Hepsera, partially offset by sales volume increases in Viread for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Other antiviral product sales increased by 5% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by a 13% increase in Hepsera sales which benefited from a favorable foreign currency exchange impact as well as sales volume growth in certain European countries. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased 3% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in certain European markets, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales of AmBisome increased 10% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain European markets. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Letairis Sales of Letairis for the treatment of PAH increased by 63% for 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Sales of Letairis increased 437% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States as Letairis was launched in June of 2007. Ranexa Sales of Ranexa were $131.1 million for the period from April 15, 2009 (the date of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics) to December 31, 2009. We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2010 as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts. 54 Table of Contents Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Royalty revenues $ 491,818 125 % $ 218,180 (53 )% $ 468,155 Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Royalty revenues for 2009 were $491.8 million, an increase of 125% compared to 2008, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $392.7 million in 2009 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008. The higher Tamiflu royalties for 2009 were due to increased Tamiflu sales by Roche related primarily to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Royalty revenues for 2008 were $218.2 million, a decrease of 53% compared to 2007, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $414.5 million in 2007. The lower Tamiflu royalties for 2008 was due primarily to decreased Roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Total product sales $ 6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796 36% $ 3,733,109 Cost of goods sold $ 1,595,558 42% $ 1,127,246 47% $ 768,771 Product gross margin 75% 78% 79% Our product gross margin for 2009 was 75%, compared to 78% for 2008. The lower product gross margin in 2009 was due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin, as well as the amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Our product gross margin for 2008 was 78% compared to 79% for 2007. The decrease in product gross margin was due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin, and the impact of changes in the product and geographic mix of our product sales. A higher mix of Atripla product sales decreases our overall product gross margin. Although we record 100% of Atripla product sales, we only benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla sales. The efavirenz portion of Atripla sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since we purchase efavirenz from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) at BMS net selling price of efavirenz. We expect our product gross margin in 2010 to be lower compared to 2009, due primarily to a higher proportion of expected Atripla sales. 55 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Research $ 185,019 16 % $ 159,148 21 % $ 131,019 Clinical development 615,041 37 % 449,598 25 % 361,091 Pharmaceutical development 139,858 24 % 113,022 14 % 98,916 Total research and development $ 939,918 30 % $ 721,768 22 % $ 591,026 R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis. R&D expenses in 2009 increased by $218.2 million or 30%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $88.8 million driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, the R&D expense reimbursement related to our Tibotec TMC278 collaboration of $52.4 million and increased clinical study expenses of $23.9 million. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. R&D expenses in 2008 increased by $130.7 million or 22%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of $75.2 million primarily in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses of $50.7 million due primarily to higher headcount. In general, significant collaboration payments, like those made to Tibotec, will cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. In 2010, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2009 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate that some of our product candidates will progress into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses over the last three years (in thousands): 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Selling, general and administrative $ 946,686 19 % $ 797,344 13 % $ 705,741 SG&A expenses in 2009 increased by $149.3 million or 19%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $75.4 million driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, increased contract and professional services expenses of $46.6 million driven primarily by our expanding sales and marketing activities and $5.8 million related to certain contract termination costs. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. SG&A expenses for 2008 increased by $91.6 million or 13%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $41.6 million due largely to higher headcount, increased marketing and 56 Table of Contents promotional expenses of $19.9 million to support our expanded commercial operations, increased consulting and support services expenses of $13.0 million related to the growth in our business, and costs of $12.4 million associated with certain employee termination-related disputes in our international operations. In 2010, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2009 levels due to increased investment to support the growth in our HIV franchise, the full year impact of sales and marketing activities for Ranexa and the commercialization of Cayston. We believe we have the appropriate infrastructure to support the growth of our business in 2010. Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses In connection with our acquisition of the cicletanine assets from Navitas Assets, LLC in 2008, we recorded IPR&D expense of $10.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. As we do not consider the acquisition to be a material purchase, we have not made further disclosures regarding the related purchased IPR&D. In connection with our acquisition of Myogen in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $2.06 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the ambrisentan and darusentan IPR&D projects that we acquired. The purchased IPR&D expense represented the estimated fair value of Myogen incomplete R&D projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. With respect to ambrisentan, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in April 2008, the European Commission granted our collaboration partner, GSK, marketing authorization for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, which is marketed under the name Volibris by GSK. With respect to darusentan, in December 2009, we announced plans to terminate the development of darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension after our second Phase 3 study of the compound failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. In connection with our acquisition of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $335.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the aztreonam for inhalation solution for CF IPR&D project that we acquired. The purchased IPR&D expense represented the estimated fair value of Corus incomplete R&D project that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa . Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $42.4 million, $59.4 million and $109.8 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to decreased interest income of $40.6 million driven by a reduction in the average yield of our investment portfolio as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in net foreign currency exchange gains of $15.7 million. The decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased costs related to our hedging activities of $32.3 million, net foreign currency exchange losses of $15.7 million and decreased interest income of $7.5 million due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset by the write-downs of certain securities recorded in 2007. Interest Expense On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for our convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and convertible senior notes due in 2013 (2013 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) on a retrospective basis. The guidance requires us to bifurcate the conversion option from the debt instrument by classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. As a result of the retrospective adoption of this guidance, we reflected additional interest expense of 57 Table of Contents $53.1 million and $50.1 million, respectively, and a related benefit from income taxes of $20.9 million and $19.7 million, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. We recorded additional interest expense of $56.2 million and a related benefit from income taxes of $21.9 million in 2009. Our interest expense was $69.7 million, $65.2 million and $63.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases in 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007 were due primarily to the effect of accreting the debt discount on the Notes as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt as discussed above. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $876.4 million, $702.4 million and $635.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 effective tax rate of 25.0% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the revaluation of certain state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested. The 2008 effective tax rate of 26.3% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. The 2007 effective tax rate of 28.7% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $119.3 million, respectively, including interest of $5.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $74.7 million and $111.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. We have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2009, we reached agreement with the IRS on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007. We also amended our California income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the IRS. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $76.2 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. 58 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the last three years (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 3,904,846 $ 3,239,639 $ 2,722,422 Working capital $ 2,940,927 $ 3,057,416 $ 2,271,344 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,080,054 $ 2,143,384 $ 1,669,082 Investing activities $ (2,215,900 ) $ (178,819 ) $ (1,302,467 ) Financing activities $ (1,051,438 ) $ (1,474,569 ) $ (170,983 ) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.90 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $665.2 million or 21% from December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $3.08 billion and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $222.7 million, partially offset by the following: cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of $245.4 million; $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; and $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes we assumed in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.24 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $517.2 million or 19% from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: net cash provided by operations of $2.14 billion in 2008; and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $246.1 million in 2008. This increase from 2007 to 2008 was partially offset by our repurchases of $1.97 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during 2008. Working Capital Working capital was $2.94 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $116.5 million or 4% from working capital as of December 31, 2008. This decrease was primarily attributable to: an increase of $209.3 million in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS; and a decrease of $133.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities since we held a higher proportion of long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. This decrease from 2008 to 2009 was partially offset by an increase of $366.1 million in our accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales. 59 Table of Contents Working capital at December 31, 2008 was $3.06 billion, an increase of $786.1 million from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to: an increase of $327.9 million in inventories due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS; an increase of $228.3 million in accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales; and an increase of $618.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. This increase from 2007 to 2008 was partially offset by a $310.9 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.08 billion in 2009 primarily related to net income of $2.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $180.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $148.4 million of amortization expenses. As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $2.14 billion in 2008 primarily related to net income of $1.97 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $209.5 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $153.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $1.67 billion in 2007 primarily related to net income of $1.58 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $184.6 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $113.4 million of deferred income taxes and $110.7 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans. This was partially offset by a $332.4 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $2.22 billion, driven by cash used for our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion (net of cash acquired), a net use of $738.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $230.1 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures made in 2009, 2008 and 2007 related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities and spending on computer and laboratory equipment, as well as enterprise software, to accommodate our continued business growth. Capital expenditures in 2009 also included the purchase of an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California. Cash used in investing activities in 2008 was $178.8 million, driven primarily by a net use of $53.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $115.0 million of capital expenditures for the year. Cash used in investing activities in 2007 was $1.30 billion, driven primarily by a net use of $1.17 billion in purchases of marketable securities, cash used in our acquisition of Nycomed Limited of $46.4 million (net of cash acquired) and $78.6 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures in 2007 included the construction of a new building at our Foster City, California headquarters. As of December 31, 2009, we had capital expenditure commitments of $24.8 million, which consisted primarily of enterprise software purchase commitments. We expect to fulfill such commitments from funds generated from our operating cash flows. 60 Table of Contents Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $1.05 billion, driven primarily by the $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $222.7 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities, as discussed above. Under our amended and restated credit agreement, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation, may borrow up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at an interest rate of either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.20 percent to 0.32 percent or the base rate, as described in the credit agreement. In April 2009, in connection with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we borrowed $400.0 million under the credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition and had fully repaid the amount as of December 31, 2009. The credit agreement will terminate in December 2012 and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall be due and payable at that time. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in whole or in part without penalty, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $1.25 billion was available to be drawn down under this credit agreement. Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.47 billion, driven primarily by the $1.97 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $246.1 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans as well as $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. In October 2007, our Board authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. In 2008, under this stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares in the open market and also entered into two structured accelerated share repurchase transactions with third parties which are described below. In February and October 2008, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with a financial institution to repurchase our common stock on an accelerated basis. For the February 2008 transaction, we paid $500.0 million to settle the initial purchase and received 9,373,548 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.34 per share. In June 2008, upon termination of the agreement we received an additional 239,612 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under this accelerated share repurchase agreement was 9,613,160 shares at an average purchase price of $52.01 per share. For the October 2008 transaction, we paid $750.0 million to settle the initial purchase and received 14,874,519 shares of our common stock at a price of $50.42 per share. In March 2009, upon termination of the agreement we received an additional 1,356,337 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under this accelerated share repurchase agreement was 16,230,856 shares at an average purchase price of $46.21 per share. As of December 31, 2009, we completed share repurchases under our $3.00 billion stock repurchase program. In January 2010, our Board authorized a new program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. This stock repurchase plan will expire in January 2011. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $171.0 million, driven primarily by the $487.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and $99.0 million used to pay off all 61 Table of Contents remaining amounts due on our term loan, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $243.4 million, distributions from noncontrolling interest of $96.3 million as well as $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Contractual Obligations Payments due by Period Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Convertible senior notes (1) $ 1,299,854 $ $ 649,987 $ 649,867 $ Operating lease obligations 244,010 46,514 80,554 46,824 70,118 Capital commitments (2) 24,780 14,518 10,262 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,117,862 820,058 249,110 48,694 Clinical trials (5) 201,814 95,478 76,186 26,793 3,357 Total $ 2,888,320 $ 976,568 $ 1,066,099 $ 772,178 $ 73,475 (1) At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding principal of $1.16 billion under the Notes that we issued in April 2006. (2) At December 31, 2009, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $24.8 million primarily relating to enterprise software purchase commitments. 62 Table of Contents (3) At December 31, 2009, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts represent minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2009, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $116.0 million as of December 31, 2009. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable and non current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) section 810-10-25. These amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis, and require an ongoing reassessment of whether the entity is a primarily beneficiary. The amended standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2010. We have been consolidating our joint ventures with BMS because we are the primary beneficiary. We are still evaluating whether the revised standard will have any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011, however early adoption is permitted. We have not yet evaluated whether these new standards will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
