Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditi on and Results of Operations Overview TripAdvisor is an online travel company and our mission is to help people around the world to plan, book and experience the perfect trip. We seek to achieve our mission by providing consumers and travel partners a global platform with rich consumer-generated content, price comparison tools and online reservation and related services for destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants. TripAdvisor, Inc., by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. Our flagship brand, TripAdvisor, is the world largest travel site based on average monthly unique visitors, which reached 490 million in our seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2018, according to our internal log files. Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include www.tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. TripAdvisor features approximately 730 million reviews and opinions on approximately 8.1 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do including 1.3 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 875,000 rental properties, 4.9 million restaurants and 1.0 million travel activities and experiences worldwide. We also enable consumers to compare prices and/or book a number of these travel experiences on either a TripAdvisor website or mobile app, or on the website or mobile app of one of our travel partners. In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we manage and operate other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing consumers the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry. For additional information about our portfolio of brands and our business model, see the disclosure set forth in Part I, Item 1. Business , under the caption Overview. Our reporting structure includes two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. Our Non-Hotel reportable segment consists of our Experiences, Restaurants and Rentals offerings. During the first quarter of 2018, we renamed Attractions as Experiences and Vacation Rentals as Rentals. These changes had no impact on the composition of our segments or on any financial information. Financial information and additional descriptive information related to our segments is contained in Note 18: Segment and Geographic Information and Note 4: Revenue Recognition, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K and below. Executive Financial Summary and Business Trends TripAdvisor is the world largest online travel site, as measured by average unique monthly visitors. As a result, TripAdvisor represents an attractive platform for travel partners including hotel chains, independent hoteliers, OTAs, destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers who seek to market and sell their products and services to a global audience. Our platform and product offerings enable consumers to find, research and price shop and book a variety of travel products, including hotels, flights, cruises, rental properties, tours, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants either directly on our websites or mobile apps, or on our travel partners websites or mobile apps. Our financial results, current trends affecting our business and our segment information are provided below. 37 Business Trends The online travel industry in which we operate, is large and growing, and also remains highly dynamic and competitive. Hotel Segment Over the past year, we have focused on delivering a great product experience and optimizing our paid marketing investments and profit as we drive for long-term, profitable growth. Marketing optimizations have impacted revenue growth, but have successfully generated significant profit growth and margin expansion compared to 2017. On the product side, we continue to make product enhancements that we believe deliver consumers a more engaging, and comprehensive, hotel shopping experience. Content on travel destinations, properties and room types continues to grow; and we continue to make it easier for consumers find the best room prices offered by our travel partners. We also continue to focus on increasing supply, and adding more properties from more travel partners. We believe that providing consumers a robust experience, with rich content and a comprehensive selection of accommodations helps increase brand awareness and brand loyalty, which, over time, can result in deeper consumer engagement with our platform, more qualified leads delivered to travel partners and higher monetization for our business. We seek to maximize revenue per hotel shopper generated in our Hotel segment. Revenue per hotel shopper performance improved throughout 2018 and increased 14% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to metasearch auction stability throughout 2018 and progress along the aforementioned product enhancements and also marketing efforts, partially offset by the continued hotel shopper growth on mobile phone, which has a significantly lower revenue per hotel shopper compared to desktop and tablet. We look to acquire hotel shoppers that meet or exceed our desired marketing return on investment targets on paid online marketing channels. Since mid-2017, we progressively increased Hotel segment profits by significantly reducing investments in direct selling and marketing channels and re-investing some of the savings into brand advertising, or television advertising, in pursuit of our long-term strategic growth objectives. As expected, the optimized marketing mix, as well as product enhancements focused on increasing traffic quality, has caused hotel shopper growth to slow and decline in recent periods; however, our marketing portfolio optimizations reduced our total marketing expenses and increased both our Hotel segment Adjusted EBITDA and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2018 as compared to 2017. Consumers are increasingly using mobile phones to conduct ecommerce activity and mobile average monthly unique visitor growth continues to drive overall user growth on our platform. We continue to support investments and product enhancements that improve the consumer experience as opposed to maximizing the number of display advertising impressions we can sell in a given period. Historically, this preference has limited the number and type of display advertising opportunities we make available to customers, which, in turn, has hampered TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising revenue growth, particularly on mobile phone. However, we continue to explore product enhancements and media advertising products that can deliver increased value to both consumers and travel partners, as well as generate more revenue for our business. Other Hotel revenue, which consists primarily of hotel revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded sites, has decreased in recent periods primarily due to increased marketing efficiency from paid online marketing channels, which has reduced revenue and improved Hotel segment profit. We have also taken certain steps to re-align operations within some of these other Hotel brands which have had a material adverse impact to revenue performance during 2018, while increasing Hotel segment profitability. Non-Hotel Segment TripAdvisor Non-Hotel offerings Experiences, Restaurants and Rentals enable consumers to discover and book great travel experiences across a diversified spectrum of travel offerings. Our key priority in our Non-Hotel segment remains revenue growth. To achieve this, we continue to invest in product, supply and marketing to improve the experience for consumers and suppliers on our platform. We believe scaling and presenting a greater selection of offerings will deepen our relationships with consumers, will drive more bookings and marketing opportunities for more travel partners and will increase monetization on our platform. 38 During 2018, Non-Hotel revenue growth was driven by growth in consumer demand, bookable supply and bookings in our Experiences an d Restaurants offerings. Rentals revenue declined primarily due to competition in the alternative accommodations marketplace as well as our strategic resource re-allocation within Non-Hotel to Experiences and Restaurants. Tax Reform The 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation. The 2017 Tax Act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation as global intangible low-taxed income ( GILTI ). These changes were effective beginning January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act also includes a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the Transition Tax ). Changes in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge totaling $73 million related to our estimate at that time of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, principally due to the Transition Tax. The Transition Tax, recorded of $67 million, which will not accrue interest, will be paid over an eight-year period, of which $31 million remained unpaid at December 31, 2018. We also recorded a charge of $6 million for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets. These estimates as of December 31, 2017 were reflected in our financial results in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118"), which provided for a measurement period of one year to complete the accounting for certain elements of the tax reform. The impact of adjustments recorded during the measurement period by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2018 was not material. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the financial statement impact of the 2017 Tax Act. 39 Results of Operations Selected Financial Data (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages) Year ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Revenue $ 1,615 $ 1,556 $ 1,480 4 % 5 % Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue 86 72 71 19 % 1 % Selling and marketing 778 849 756 (8 )% 12 % Technology and content 275 243 243 13 % 0 % General and administrative 177 157 143 13 % 10 % Depreciation 82 79 69 4 % 14 % Amortization of intangible assets 34 32 32 6 % 0 % Total costs and expenses 1,432 1,432 1,314 0 % 9 % Operating income 183 124 166 48 % (25 )% Other income (expense): Interest expense (12 ) (15 ) (12 ) (20 )% 25 % Interest income and other, net 2 1 (3 ) 100 % n.m.

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment , as Adjusted EBITDA by segment divided by Revenue by segment. Hotel Segment Our Hotel segment revenue decreased $39 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to a $34 million decrease in TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue and $21 million decrease in other Hotel revenue, partially offset by $16 million increase in TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, all of which are discussed below. Our Hotel segment revenue increased $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to $6 million increase in TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue and $10 million increase in TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in other Hotel revenue, all of which are discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Hotel segment increased $70 million and to 31%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to a decrease in our direct selling and marketing expenses related to SEM and other online paid traffic acquisition costs as we have continued to optimize and improve our marketing efficiency from our online marketing campaigns and, to a lesser extent, growth in our TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Hotel segment decreased $94 million and to 24%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to costs related to our television campaign, which launched in June 2017, and also due to increased SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs during the first half of 2017, partially offset by cost savings created through optimization and improved marketing efficiencies of our online marketing campaigns during the second half of 2017. The following is a detailed discussion of the revenue sources within our Hotel segment: Year ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 2017 vs 2016 Hotel: (in millions) TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction $ 722 $ 756 $ 750 (4 %) 1 % TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription 308 292 282 5 % 4 % Other Hotel revenue 127 148 158 (14 %) (6 %) Total Hotel revenue $ 1,157 $ 1,196 $ 1,190 (3 %) 1 % TripAdvisor-branded Click-based and Transaction Revenue TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue includes CPC-advertising revenue from our TripAdvisor-branded websites as well as transaction-based revenue from our hotel instant booking feature. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 62%, 63% and 63%, respectively, of our Hotel segment revenue was derived from our TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue decreased $34 million or 4% during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to a 4% decrease in our average monthly unique hotel shoppers as well as a 2% decrease in our revenue per hotel shopper during the year ended December 31, 2018, which is explained below. TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue increased $6 million or 1% during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in our average monthly unique hotel shoppers of 10%, which was largely offset by a decrease of 9% in our revenue per hotel shopper during the year ended December 31, 2017, which is explained below. Our largest source of Hotel segment revenue is click-based advertising revenue from our TripAdvisor-branded websites, which include links to our travel partners sites and contextually-relevant branded and related text links. Click-based advertising is generated primarily through our metasearch auction, a description of which follows. Our 41 click-based travel partners are predominantly OTAs and hoteliers. Click-based advertising is generally pric ed on a CPC basis , with payments to us from advertisers based on the number of consumer clicks on each type of link or, in other words, the conversion of a hotel shopper to a paid click. CPC is the price that a partner is willing to pay us for a hotel shop per lead, which is determined in a competitive process as partner CPC bids for rates and availability listed on our site are submitted. When a CPC bid is submitted, the partner agrees to pay us the bid amount each time a consumer clicks on the link to that partner website. Bids can be submitted periodically as often as daily on a property-by-property basis. Primary factors used to determine the placement of partner links on our site include, but are not limited to, nightly room rate, the size of the bi d relative to other bids, and other variables. H otel shoppers visiting via mobile phones currently monetize at a significantly lower rate than hotel shoppers visiting via desktop or tablet. Our Hotel segment transaction-based revenue is comprised of revenu e from our hotel instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a pre-determined commission rate to TripAdvisor fo r each consumer that completes a hotel reservation via our website. The key drivers of TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue include average monthly unique hotel shoppers and revenue per hotel shopper, the latter of which measures how effectively we convert our hotel shoppers into revenue. We measure performance by calculating revenue per hotel shopper on an aggregate basis by dividing total TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue by total average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites for the periods presented. While we believe that total traffic growth, or growth in monthly visits from unique visitors, is reflective of our overall brand growth, we also track and analyze sub-segments of our traffic and their correlation to revenue generation and utilize data regarding hotel shoppers as one of the key indicators of revenue growth. Hotel shoppers are visitors who view either a listing of hotels in a city or on a specific hotel page. The number of hotel shoppers tends to vary based on seasonality of the travel industry and general economic conditions, as well as other factors outside of our control. The table below summarizes our revenue per hotel shopper calculation and growth rate, in the aggregate, for the periods presented (in millions, except calculated revenue per hotel shopper and percentages): Year ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 2017 vs 2016 (in millions) Revenue per hotel shopper: TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction revenue $ 722 $ 756 $ 750 (4 %) 1 % Divided by: Total average monthly unique hotel shoppers for the year 1,742 1,814 1,645 (4 %) 10 % $ 0.41 $ 0.42 $ 0.46 (2 %) (9 %) 2018 vs. 2017 Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, according to our internal log files. The decrease was primarily driven by travel partners bidding to lower CPCs in our click-based metasearch auction during the second half of 2017, which created difficult year-over-year growth comparisons during the first half of 2018, as well as a greater percentage of hotel shoppers visiting TripAdvisor-branded websites and apps on mobile phones, partially offset by our success in product improvements and increasing traffic quality, as discussed above. 42 Our aggregate average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites decreased by 4% during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, according to our internal log files. The decrease wa s primarily due to significantly reducing our direct marketing spend on our least-profitable paid online marketing campaigns, as well as product enhancements focused on increasing traffic quality, which we believe limits our ability to grow hotel shoppers in the near term, as discussed above , partially offset by the general trend of an increasing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites and apps on mobile phones which we continued to experience during 2018 . 2017 vs. 2016 Revenue per hotel shopper decreased 9% during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, according to our internal log files. The decrease was primarily driven by travel partners bidding to lower CPCs in our click-based metasearch auction during the second half of 2017, and the general trend of a greater percentage of hotel shoppers visiting TripAdvisor-branded websites and apps on mobile phones, which grew significantly faster than traffic from desktop and tablet devices, as well as dilution from product testing related to the second-quarter 2017 launch of our redesigned website and apps, and the timing of our hotel instant booking feature rollout in certain non-U.S. markets during the first half of 2016. Our aggregate average monthly unique hotel shoppers on TripAdvisor-branded websites increased by 10% during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, according to our internal log files. The increase in hotel shoppers is primarily due to the general trend of an increasing number of hotel shoppers visiting our websites on mobile phones, as well as growth in our paid online marketing channels, partially offset by marketing spend tradeoffs resulting from increased brand advertising investment in our television campaign, as discussed above. TripAdvisor-branded Display-based Advertising and Subscription Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 27%, 24% and 24%, respectively, of our Hotel segment revenue was derived from our TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue, which primarily consists of revenue from display-based advertising and subscription-based hotel advertising revenue. 2018 vs. 2017 Our TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue increased by $16 million or 5%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to revenue from our new media ad product during 2018, which enables hotels to enhance their visibility on TripAdvisor hotel pages. The increase was partially offset by the general trend of an increasing percentage of our traffic visiting our websites on mobile phones, which yield smaller impression opportunities due to the smaller screen size. 2017 vs. 2016 Our TripAdvisor-branded display-based advertising and subscription revenue increased by $10 million or 4%, during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in display-based advertising revenue was primarily due to an increase in impressions sold, as well as an increase in pricing, partially offset by the general trend of an increasing percentage of our traffic visiting our websites on mobile phones, in addition to hotel industry consolidation. Other Hotel Revenue For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 11%, 12% and 13%, respectively, of our Hotel segment revenue was derived from other Hotel revenue. Our other Hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded websites, such as bookingbuddy.com, cruisecritic.com, onetime.com, and smartertravel.com, primarily through click-based advertising and display-based advertising. Other Hotel revenue decreased by $21 million and $10 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to increased marketing efficiency from paid online marketing channels, and in 2018, increased with the elimination of some marginal and unprofitable revenue within 43 these offerings , in addition to realignment of certain capital resources within the Hotel segment. These steps have resulted in increased profitab ility within the Hotel segment; however, these changes have had an adverse impact on other Hotel r evenue performance in 2018 and 2017 . Non-Hotel Segment For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Non-Hotel segment revenue accounted for 28%, 23% and 20%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenue. Our Non-Hotel segment revenue increased by $98 million or 27% and $70 million or 24%, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by Experiences and Restaurants, as we continue our investment in product, bookable supply and marketing. Experiences continued to generate strong revenue due to increased growth in bookings, which was primarily driven by an increased and greater selection of bookable supply, and growth in demand from bookings sourced by TripAdvisor. Another contributing factor was the key feature improvements made to the shopping experience, which improvements are ongoing. In addition, we launched a new supplier platform during the fourth quarter of 2018, which increased the efficiency with which suppliers can participate and market their bookable experiences, thereby offering consumers a greater selection of travel activities and experiences. Continued strong revenue growth in Restaurants was primarily due to seated diner growth, mobile bookings growth, user experience improvements, and increased bookable supply of restaurant listings, as well as increased revenue from TripAdvisor websites. Rentals revenue decreased during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increasing competition in the alternative accommodations marketplace and our strategic re-allocation of resources within the Non-Hotel segment to support growth in Experiences and Restaurants, and to a lesser extent the continued migration of our subscription model to our free-to-list model . Revenue in our Rentals offering decreased slightly during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the continued migration of our subscription model to our free-to-list model, in addition to a slower growth rate in our free-to-list revenues than 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Non-Hotel segment increased $21 million and to 14%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in our Non-Hotel segment revenue, partially offset primarily by increased personnel and overhead costs of $41 million, to support growth in this segment during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as an increase in online advertising costs. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in our Non-Hotel segment increased $73 million and to 13%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in our Non-Hotel segment revenue, in addition to increased efficiencies in paid online marketing channels and other operational synergies across our Experiences and Rentals offerings, partially offset by increased personnel and overhead costs to support growth in this segment for the year ended December 31, 2017. Consolidated Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of expenses that are directly related or closely correlated to revenue generation, including direct costs, such as credit card and other booking transaction payment fees, data center costs, costs associated with prepaid tour tickets, ad serving fees, flight search fees, and other transaction costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses for certain customer support personnel who are directly involved in revenue generation. Year ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 2017 vs 2016 (in millions) Direct costs $ 67 $ 53 $ 51 26 % 4 % Personnel and overhead 19 19 20 0 % (5 %) Total cost of revenue $ 86 $ 72 $ 71 19 % 1 % % of revenue 5.3 % 4.6 % 4.8 % 44 2018 vs. 2017 Cost of revenue increased $14 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased direct costs associated with prepaid tour tickets and merchant credit card and other transaction payment processing fees as a result of revenue growth in our Non-Hotel segment and, to a lesser extent, an increase in transaction costs related to revenue generation in our Hotel segment. 2017 vs. 2016 Cost of revenue increased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased direct costs from merchant credit card and other transaction payment processing fees as a result of revenue growth in our Non-Hotel segment. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of direct costs, including traffic generation costs from SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs, syndication costs and affiliate program commissions, social media costs, brand advertising, television and other offline advertising, promotions and public relations. In addition, our sales and marketing expenses consist of indirect costs such as personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries, commissions, benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and bonuses for sales, sales support, customer support and marketing employees. Year ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 2017 vs 2016 (in millions) Direct costs $ 553 $ 639 $ 554 (13 %) 15 % Personnel and overhead 225 210 202 7 % 4 % Total selling and marketing $ 778 $ 849 $ 756 (8 %) 12 % % of revenue 48.2 % 54.6 % 51.1 % 2018 vs. 2017 Direct selling and marketing costs decreased $86 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to decreased SEM and online traffic acquisition costs in our Hotel segment, partially offset by an increase in our Hotel segment television advertising campaign spend of $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, and by an increase in online and offline advertising costs in our Non-Hotel segment during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Personnel and overhead costs increased $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, due to an increase in headcount in our Non-Hotel segment to support business growth. 2017 vs. 2016 Direct selling and marketing costs increased $85 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to costs incurred related to the launch of a new television campaign in June of 2017, as well as an increase in SEM and other online traffic acquisition costs in our Hotel segment during the first half of 2017, partially offset by a decrease in other advertising costs. We spent $74 million on our television advertising campaign during the year ended December 31, 2017 attributable to our Hotel segment, which we did not incur during the year ended December 31, 2016. Technology and Content Technology and content expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead expenses, including salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and bonuses for salaried employees and contractors engaged in the 45 design, development, testing, content support, and maintenance of our websites and mobile apps. Other costs include licensing, maintenance expense, computer supplies, telecom costs, content translation costs, and consulting costs. Year ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 2017 vs 2016 (in millions) Personnel and overhead $ 246 $ 219 $ 213 12 % 3 % Other 29 24 30 21 % (20 %) Total technology and content $ 275 $ 243 $ 243 13 % 0 % % of revenue 17.0 % 15.6 % 16.4 % 2018 vs. 2017 Technology and content costs increased $32 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to increased personnel and overhead costs, which includes an increase in stock-based compensation of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in headcount to support business growth in our Non-Hotel segment. Other costs increased by $5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in software and other professional licensing costs. 2017 vs. 2016 Technology and content costs remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. Personnel and overhead costs increased $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily to support our mobile phone and website initiatives, as well as to support business growth, partially offset by a decrease in contingent staff costs. Other costs decreased by $6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in content translation costs. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs, including personnel engaged in leadership, finance, legal, and human resources, as well as stock-based compensation expense for those same personnel. General and administrative costs also include professional service fees and other fees including audit, legal, tax and accounting, and other costs including bad debt expense, non-income taxes, such as sales, use and other non-income related taxes. Year ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 2017 vs 2016 (in millions) Personnel and overhead $ 129 $ 116 $ 101 11 % 15 % Professional service fees and other 48 41 42 17 % (2 %) Total general and administrative $ 177 $ 157 $ 143 13 % 10 % % of revenue 11.0 % 10.1 % 9.7 % 46 2018 vs. 2017 General and administrative costs increased $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Personnel costs and overhead costs increased $13 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $10 million, which was primarily as a result of equity awards granted to our CEO in November 2017. Professional service fees and other increased $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase of $5 million in legal settlements and to a lesser extent an increase in bad debt expense. 2017 vs. 2016 General and administrative costs increased $14 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. Personnel costs and overhead costs increased $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation of $10 million. Professional service fees and other decreased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in consulting costs and non-income taxes, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. Depreciation Depreciation expense consists of depreciation on computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture, office equipment and other assets, our corporate headquarters building and amortization of capitalized software and website development costs. Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Depreciation $ 82 $ 79 $ 69 % of revenue 5.1 % 5.1 % 4.7 % Depreciation expense increased $3 million and $10 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 when compared to the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to an increase in amortization related to capitalized software and website development costs. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization consists of the amortization of definite-lived intangibles purchased in business acquisitions. Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Amortization of intangible assets $ 34 $ 32 $ 32 % of revenue 2.1 % 2.1 % 2.2 % Amortization of intangible assets increased $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to incremental amortization from purchased definite-lived intangibles related to a business acquisition during 2018. Refer to Note 3: Acquisitions and Other Investments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, as incremental amortization from purchased definite-lived intangibles related to business acquisitions in 2016 were offset due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets from business acquisitions in prior periods. 47 Interest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred, commitment fees and debt issuance cost amortization related to our 2015 Credit Facility, 2016 Credit Facility, and Chinese Credit Facilities, as well as interest on our financing obligation related to our corporate headquarters. Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Interest expense $ (12 ) $ (15 ) $ (12 ) Interest expense decreased $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings on our 2015 Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense increased $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in interest incurred related to higher average outstanding borrowings and effective interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily on our 2015 Credit Facility. Refer to Note 10: Debt and Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our borrowing facilities and our financing obligation related to our corporate h eadquarters building, respectively. Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net primarily consists of interest earned from our money market funds and marketable securities, amortization of discounts and premiums on our marketable securities, net foreign exchange gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of our marketable securities. Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Interest income and other, net $ 2 $ 1 $ (3 ) Interest income and other, net increased $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest income earned from our money market funds of $6 million and a loss of $2 million in 2017 related to our investment in a privately-held company which did not reoccur in 2018, partially offset by an increase of $7 million in net foreign currency transaction losses as a result of the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates. Interest income and other, net increased $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase of $6 million in net foreign currency transaction gains, as a result of the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a loss of $2 million related to our investment in a privately-held company recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017, which did not occur in 2016. Provision for Income Taxes Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 60 $ 129 $ 31 Effective income tax rate 34.7 % 117.3 % 20.5 % On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into United States tax law. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering corporate income tax rates, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The 2017 Tax Act permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on the financial statement impact of the 2017 Tax Act. 48 Our effective income tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate in the United States primarily due to foreign valuation allowances, unrecognized tax benefits, and non-deductible stock based compensation. This is partially offset by international provisions from the 2017 Tax Act, and earnings in jurisdictions outside the United States, where our effective income tax rate is lower. 2018 vs. 2017 Our effective income tax rate decreased to 34.7% during the year ended December 31, 2018 from 117.3% in the same period in 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily due to the Transition Tax and remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the 2017 Tax Act recorded in 2017 and which did not reoccur in 2018, as well as the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate. 2017 vs. 2016 Our effective income tax rate increased to 117.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 from 20.5% in the same period in 2016. The change in the effective income tax rate for 2017 compared to the 2016 rate was primarily due to the Transition Tax and remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, foreign valuation allowances, and non-deductible stock based compensation. We recorded an estimate of $67 million of Transition Tax, and $6 million due to a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, during the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflected provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act, which did not occur in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure refers to a numerical measure of a company historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) in such company financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA is also our segment profit measure and a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the operating performance of our business and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based and approved. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (6) goodwill, long-lived asset and intangible asset impairments; (7) legal reserves and settlements; and (8) other non-recurring expenses and income. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company revised its Adjusted EBITDA definition to exclude legal reserves and settlements, as the Company believes these costs are not directly tied to the core operations of our business. The Company believes that excluding these amounts better enables management and investors to compare financial results between periods as these costs may vary independent of business performance. This revision to our definition did not have a material impact to Adjusted EBITDA for any period prior to the year ended December 31, 2018; therefore, no reclassifications have been made to conform the prior periods to the current period presentation. This revision had no effect on GAAP results in any period. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results. 49 Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation or other stock-settled obligations; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain income and expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our business, such as legal reserves and settlements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented: Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Net income (loss) $ 113 $ (19 ) $ 120 Add: Provision for income taxes 60 129 31 Add: Other expense (income), net 10 14 15 Add: Stock-based compensation 118 96 85 Add: Legal reserves and settlements 5 - - Add: Amortization of intangible assets 34 32 32 Add: Depreciation 82 79 69 Adjusted EBITDA $ 422 $ 331 $ 352 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows generated from operations, although liquidity needs can also be met through drawdowns under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $670 million and $735 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term available-for-sale marketable debt securities. As of December 31, 2018 approximately $237 million of our cash and cash equivalents, and $15 million of short-term available-for-sale marketable debt securities, were held by our international subsidiaries outside of the United States, with the majority in the United Kingdom . As of December 31, 2018 the significant majority of total cash on hand is denominated in U.S. dollars. Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $651 million as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made a one-time repatriation of $325 million of foreign earnings to the United States primarily to repay our remaining outstanding debt under the 2015 Credit Facility. We intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining foreign undistributed earnings although we will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our capital deployment within and outside the U.S. Should we distribute, or be treated under certain U.S. tax rules as having distributed, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. 50 income taxes or tax benefits. The amount of a ny unrecognized deferred income tax on this temporary difference is not material. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings and approximately $1.2 billion of borrowing capacity available under our 2015 Credit Facility and approximately $40 million of borrowing capacity available under our Chinese Credit Facilities. For further discussion on our credit facilities, see below, and also refer to Note 10: Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 2015 Credit Facility In June 2015, we entered into a five year credit agreement with a group of lenders which, among other things, provided for a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2015 Credit Facility ). In May 2017, the 2015 Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate amount of revolving loan commitments available from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion; and (ii) extend the maturity date of the 2015 Credit Facility from June 26, 2020 to May 12, 2022 (the First Amendment ). Borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility generally bear interest, at the Company option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the Eurocurrency Borrowing rate, or the adjusted LIBO rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing; plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% ( Eurocurrency Spread ), based on the Company leverage ratio; or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) Borrowing, which is the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the New York Fed Bank Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (or LIBO rate multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate) for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%; in addition to an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% ( ABR Spread ), based on the Company leverage ratio. The Company may borrow from the 2015 Credit Facility in U.S. dollars, Euros and British pound. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings and approximately $1.2 billion of borrowing capacity available under our 2015 Credit Facility. We are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee, at an applicable rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.30%, on the daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility for each fiscal quarter and additional fees in connection with the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, our unused revolver capacity was subject to a commitment fee of 0.15%, given the Company leverage ratio. The 2015 Credit Facility includes $15 million of borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and $40 million for Swingline borrowings on same-day notice. The 2015 Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends and distributions, make investments, loans or advances, prepay certain subordinated indebtedness, make certain acquisitions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend material agreements governing certain subordinated indebtedness, and change our fiscal year. The 2015 Credit Facility also requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default, including a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the 2015 Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of all amounts due under the 2015 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 2016 Credit Facility We were party to an uncommitted facility agreement which provided for a $73 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Facility ) with no specific expiration date. We initially borrowed $73 million from this uncommitted credit facility in 2016 and repaid the full amount during the year ended December 31, 2017. These funds were used for general working capital needs of the Company, primarily for partial repayment of our 2015 Credit Facility. In June 2018, the Company terminated the 2016 Credit Facility and had no outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility at the time of termination. Chinese Credit Facilities We are parties to a $30 million, one-year revolving credit facility with Bank of America (the Chinese Credit Facility BOA ) that is currently subject to review on a periodic basis with no specific expiration period. 51 Borrowings u nder our Chinese Credit Facility BOA generally bears interest at a rate based on People Bank of China benchmark, including certain adjustments which may be made in accordance with market conditions at the time of borrowing. As of December 31, 2018 there were no outstanding borrowings under our Chinese Credit Facility BOA. We are also parties to a RMB 70,000,000 (approximately $10 million), one-year revolving credit facility with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank ( Chinese Credit Facility JPM ). Our Chinese Credit Facility JPM generally bears interest at a rate based on People Bank of China benchmark, including certain adjustments which may be made in accordance with market conditions at the time of borrowing. As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Chinese Credit Facility JPM. On February 15, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $250 million of our shares of common stock under a share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 2,002,356 shares of the Company outstanding common stock under this share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $105 million, and completed this share repurchase program. On January 25, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $250 million of our shares of common stock under another share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of 6,079,003 shares of the Company outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $250 million, and completed this share repurchase program. On January 31, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $250 million of our shares of common stock under a share repurchase program. This share repurchase program has no expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 2,582,198 shares of the Company outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $100 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had a remaining $150 million available to repurchase shares of our common stock under this share repurchase program. Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations that affect the timing of our annual cash flows related to working capital. In our Rentals free-to-list model and our Experiences offerings, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts, net of commissions, on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant payables. We pay the suppliers, or the property rental owners and experience providers, after the travelers use. Therefore, we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying the supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source or use of cash to us. During the first half of the year Rentals and Experiences bookings typically exceed the amount of completed stays and tour-taking, resulting in higher cash flow related to working capital, while during the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter, this pattern reverses and cash flows from these transactions are typically negative. While we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue, further significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends. We believe that our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, combined with expected cash flows generated by operating activities and available borrowings from our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our foreseeable working capital requirements, capital expenditures, existing business growth initiatives, debt obligations, lease commitments, and other financial commitments through at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions, share repurchases, and/or other expenditures in support of our business strategy, thus may potentially reduce our cash balance and/or increase our debt. Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 405 $ 238 $ 321 Investing activities (49) 6 (163 ) Financing activities (358 ) (200 ) (143 ) 52 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our primary use of cash was in operations, f inancing activities, including the repayment of combined outstanding borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility and Chinese Credit Facilities of $245 million, repurchases of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $100 million under our existin g share repurchase program, and investing activities, including capital expenditures incurred during the year of $61 million and business acquisitions and other investing activities of $36 million. This use of cash was funded primarily with cash on hand an d cash equivalents, which included a one-time cash repatriation $325 million of foreign earnings to the United States, cash provided by operations, and investing activities, including net cash generated of $48 million from purchases, sales and maturities o f marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our primary use of cash was in operations, financing activities, including the repayment of borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility of $296 million, repurchases of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $250 million under a share repurchase program, repayment of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Facility of $73 million, and investing activities, including capital expenditures incurred during the year of $64 million. This use of cash was funded primarily with cash on hand and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations, financing activities, including additional net borrowings of $433 million under the 2015 Credit Facility, and investing activities, including net cash generated of $70 million from purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our primary use of cash was in operations, and financing activities, including the repayment of borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility of $210 million, repurchases of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $105 million under a share repurchase program, and investing activities, including capital expenditures incurred during the year of $72 million and net cash used of a $50 million in purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, and business acquisitions and other investments of $43 million. This use of cash was funded primarily with cash on hand and cash equivalents, cash provided by operations, and financing activities, including additional borrowings of $101 million under the 2015 Credit Facility and $73 million under the 2016 Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $167 million or 70% when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to an increase in net income of $132 million and an increase in net working capital movements of $35 million, primarily due to the timing of collection of customer receivables, vendor payments, and income tax payments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $83 million or 26% when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in net income of $139 million and a decrease in net working capital movements of $14 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash items affecting cash flow of $70 million which is primarily due to an increase in the following items: deferred tax expenses; stock-based compensation; and depreciation. The decrease in working capital movements of $14 million was primarily due to the timing of collection of customer receivables, vendor payments, income tax payments, and deferred merchant payments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities decreased by $55 million when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to a decrease in net cash generated from the purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable securities of $22 million, and an increase in cash paid for business acquisitions and other investing activities of $36 million during year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities increased by $169 million when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase in net cash provided from the purchases, sales and maturities of our marketable securities of $120 million, a decrease in cash paid for business acquisitions and other investments of $43 million, and a decrease in capital expenditures of $8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities increased by $158 million when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to a net repayment on our 2015 Credit Facility of $230 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net borrowing of $137 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by a decrease of $150 million in cash used to purchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs in 2018, as discussed above, as well as the repayment of our 2016 Credit Facility borrowings of $73 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which did not reoccur in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities increased by $57 million when compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to an increase of $145 million in cash used in 2017 to purchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs in 2017, as discussed above, as well as a net new borrowing on 53 our 2016 Credit Facility of $73 million in 2016 which was subsequently repaid in 2017, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility of $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 when compa red to the same period in 2016. The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018: By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years (in millions) Property leases, net of sublease income (1) $ 193 $ 25 $ 49 $ 43 $ 76 2017 Tax Act - Transition tax liability 31 - - 4 27 Expected commitment fee payments on 2015 Credit Facility (2) 6 2 3 1 - Purchase obligations and other (3) 19 7 8 3 1 Total (4),(5) $ 249 $ 34 $ 60 $ 51 $ 104 (1) Estimated future minimum rental payments under operating leases with non-cancelable lease terms, including our corporate headquarters lease in Needham, MA. Refer to Office Lease Commitments discussion below. (2) Expected commitment fee payments are based on the daily unused portion of the 2015 Credit Facility, issued letters of credit, and the effective commitment fee rate as of December 31, 2018; however, these variables could change significantly in the future. (3) Estimated purchase obligations that are fixed and determinable are primarily related to telecommunication and licensing contracts, with various expiration dates through approximately December 2024. These contracts have non-cancelable terms or are cancelable only upon payment of significant penalty. (4) Excluded from the table was $148 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, that we have recorded in other long-term liabilities for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. We do not anticipate any material changes in the next year. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. (5) Excluded from the table was $3 million of undrawn standby letters of credit, primarily related to our property leases. Office Lease Commitments In June 2013 we entered into a lease for a new corporate headquarters building ( Headquarters Lease ). Pursuant to the Headquarters Lease, the landlord built an approximately 280,000 square foot rental building in Needham, Massachusetts (the Premises ), and leased the Premises to the Company as our corporate headquarters for an initial term of 15 years and 7 months or through December 2030. The Company also has an option to extend the term of the Headquarters Lease for two consecutive terms of five years each. Because we were involved in the construction project and were responsible for paying a significant portion of the costs of normal finish work and structural elements of the Premises, the Company was deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the Premises during the construction period under build to suit lease accounting guidance under GAAP. Therefore, the Company recorded project construction costs during the construction period incurred by the landlord as a construction-in-progress asset and a related construction financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. The amounts that the Company has paid or incurred for normal tenant improvements and structural improvements had also been recorded to the construction-in-progress asset. 54 Upon completion of construction at end of the second quarter of 2015, we evaluated the construction-in-progress asset and construction financing obligation for de-recognition under the criteria for sale-leaseback treatment under GAAP. We concluded that we have forms of continued economic involvement in the facility, and therefore did not meet the provisions for sale-leaseback accounting. This determination was based on the Company's continuing involvement with the property in the form of non-recourse financing to the lessor. Therefore, the Headquarters Lease is accounted for as a financing obligation. Accordingly, we began depreciating the building asset over its estimated useful life and incurring interest expense related t o the financing obligation imputed using the effective interest rate method. We bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the Premises into: (i) a portion that is allocated to the building (a reduction to the financing obligation) and; (ii) a portion that i s allocated to the land on which the building was constructed. The portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease that commenced in 2013. The lease costs allocated to the land are recognized as rent expense on a str aight-line basis over the term of the lease and are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The financing obligation is considered a long-term finance lease obligation and is recorded to other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $7 million of interest expense in each year, respectively, $3 million of depreciation expense in each year, respectively, and $2 millio n of rent expense in each year, in general and administrative expense, respectively, on our consolidated statements of operations related to the Premises. We also lease an aggregate of approximately 450,000 square feet of office space at approximately 40 other locations across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific in cities such as, New York, Boston, London, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris, and Beijing, primarily for our sales offices, subsidiary headquarters, and international management teams, pursuant to leases with various expiration dates, with the latest expiring in June 2027. As of December 31, 2018, future minimum commitments under our Headquarters Lease and other non-cancelable operating leases for office space with terms of more than one year and contractual sublease income were as follows: Year Corporate Headquarters Lease (1) Other Operating Leases Sublease Income Total Lease Commitments (Net of Sublease Income) (in millions) 2019 $ 9 $ 19 $ (3 ) $ 25 2020 9 18 (2 ) 25 2021 10 16 (2 ) 24 2022 10 16 (2 ) 24 2023 10 9 19 Thereafter 67 9 76 Total $ 115 $ 87 $ (9 ) $ 193 (1) Amount includes an $83 million financing obligation, which we have recorded in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018, related to our Headquarters Lease. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new lease accounting guidance under ASC 842, Leases, which the Company will adopt on January 1, 2019 . Upon adoption, we expect our Headquarters Lease to be classified and accounted for as a finance lease under the new accounting guidance, rather than as a financing obligation under the existing GAAP. Upon adoption of the new guidance, we expect to derecognize amounts in property and equipment, net and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 related to our Headquarters Lease of approximately $62 million and $70 million, respectively, with the difference recorded to our opening balance of retained earnings as of the adoption date. Accordingly, we expect to then recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset ranging from $105 million to $120 million and a lease liability of approximately $85 million to $95 million based on the initial measurement of the present value of the remaining lease payments over the remaining lease term. The difference between the ROU asset and lease liability relates to a net prepaid rent balance. We expect our office space leases, except for our Headquarters Lease, to remain operating 55 leases under the new guidance, which we will recognize ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet under the new guidance. We expect to recognize ROU assets ranging from $70 million to $80 million and lease liabi lities of approximately $85 million to $95 million based on the present value of the remaining rental payments for these office leases as of January 1, 2019. The difference in the ROU asset and the lease liability is the result of balances already recogniz ed related to deferred and prepaid rent balances. W e do not expect the adoption of this new guidance will have a material impact, either on an annual or quarterly basis, to our consolidated statement of operations, including operating income, net income an d adjusted EBITDA, as well as to our consolidated statement of cash flows on a go-forward basis. Refer to Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for furth er discussion regarding the new lease accounting guidance and its expected impact of adoption to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018, other than the items discussed above, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are parties to regulatory and legal matters, including threats thereof, arising out of our operations. These matters may involve claims involving patent and intellectual property rights (including alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights), tax matters (including value-added, excise, transient occupancy and accommodation taxes), regulatory compliance (including competition and consumer matters), defamation and other claims. Periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess any potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred; and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the consolidated financial statements. We base accruals on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, we do not believe that the final disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from our estimates. Finally, there may be claims or actions pending or threatened against us of which we are currently not aware and the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on us. On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB 118, which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Accordingly, we recorded an estimate of $67 million of Transition Tax, and $6 million due to a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, during the year ended December 31, 2017, which reflected provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for the purposes of SAB 118 . During the measurement period, impacts of the law were recorded at the time a reasonable estimate for all or a portion of the effects were made, and provisional amounts were recognized and adjusted as information became available, prepared, or analyzed . As permitted under SAB 118, we have subsequently finalized our accounting analysis based on the guidance, interpretations, and data available as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $2 million income tax expense related to the Transition Tax, which reflects additional information that we obtained during 2018 related to uncertain tax positions, earnings and profits, foreign tax credits, and state taxes. We also recorded a $2 million benefit related to the adjustment of deferred taxes based on the tax rate that is expected to apply when such deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods. We are also under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities. Although we believe our tax 56 estimates are reasonable, the final determination of audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period for which that determination is made. By virtue of consolidated income tax returns previously filed with Expedia, we are currently under an IRS audit for the 2009, 2010, and short-period 2011 tax years, and have various ongoing state income tax audits. We are separately under examination by the IRS for the short-period 2011, 2012 and 2013 tax years and under an employment tax audit with the IRS for the 2013 and 2014 tax years. These audits include questioning of the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. These examinations may lead to proposed or ordinary course adjustments to our taxes. We are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2009. As of December 31, 2018, no material assessments have resulted, except as noted below regarding our 2009 and 2010 IRS audit with Expedia. In January 2017, as part of the IRS audit of Expedia, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. These proposed adjustments are related to certain transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries, and would result in an increase to our worldwide income tax expense in an estimated range of $10 million to $14 million after consideration of competent authority relief, exclusive of interest and penalties. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to defend our position through applicable administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies. Our policy is to review and update tax reserves as facts and circumstances change. Based on our interpretation of the regulations and available case law, we believe the position we have taken with regard to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries is sustainable. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2009 and 2010 transactions, if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we would be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In July 2015, the United States Tax Court (the Court ) issued an opinion favorable to Altera Corporation ( Altera ) with respect to Altera litigation with the IRS. This opinion was submitted as a final decision under Tax Court Rule 155 during December 2015. The litigation relates to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing arrangement with Altera foreign subsidiary. In its opinion, the Court accepted Altera position of excluding stock based compensation from its inter-company cost-sharing arrangement. The IRS appealed the Court decision on February 19, 2016. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation in intercompany cost-sharing arrangements. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $3 million, $5 million and $6 million in its consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Since the Court 2015 opinion, the Company has taken total income tax benefits of $15 million as of December 31, 2018. On July 24, 2018, the IRS won the appeals court case at the Ninth Circuit; however, on August 7, 2018, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its decision regarding Altera and the case was reheard. While we have taken an income tax benefit based on the Court 2015 opinion, as discussed above, we will continue to review the latest decisions on the case and its impact to our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we continue to accumulate positive cash flows in foreign jurisdictions, which we consider indefinitely reinvested, although we will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our capital deployment within and outside the U.S. Should we distribute, or be treated under certain U.S. tax rules as having distributed, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes or tax benefits. The amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax on this temporary difference is not material. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, potential contingencies surrounding current audits by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities, and other income tax matters. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions For information on our relationships with LTRIP and Expedia refer to Note 17: Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 57 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that management use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, when applicable and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and/or Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an overview of our significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements. A discussion of information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates is below. Recognition and Recoverability of Goodwill, Definite-Lived Intangibles, and Other Long-Term Assets We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and assumed liabilities be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer and supplier relationships, acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision, where appropriate. We assess goodwill, which is not amortized, for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units, it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety. Accordingly, the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill. The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we generally first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Periodically, we may choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the size of the 58 reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments from the date of acquisition to establish an updated baseline quantitative analysis, and other performance and market indicators. During a qualitative assessment, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If, however, we determine that it is more likely than not that the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount, we then perform a quantitative assess ment and compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the goodwill impairment is measured using the difference between the carrying value and the f a ir value of the reporting unit; however, any loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. In determining the estimated fair values of reporting units in a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we generally use a blend, of the following recognized valuation methods: the income approach (discounted cash flows model) and the market valuation approach, which we believe compensates for the inherent risks of using either model on a stand-alone basis. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit; income tax rates and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business and other precedent transactions. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and/or income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Valuations are performed by management or third party valuation specialists under management's supervision, where appropriate. We believe that the estimated fair values assigned to our reporting units in impairment tests are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments could trigger the need for an impairment charge, or materially increase or decrease the amount of any such impairment charge. During the Company's annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018, a qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units' goodwill was performed and we concluded it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed. Accordingly, we did not proceed to a quantitative assessment or recognize any impairment charges during the year ending December 31, 2018. As part of our qualitative assessment for our 2018 goodwill impairment analysis of our reporting units, the factors that we considered included, but were not limited to: (a) changes in macroeconomic conditions in the overall economy and the specific markets in which we operate, (b) our ability to access capital, (c) changes in the online travel industry, (d) changes in the level of competition, (e) evaluation of current and future forecasted financial results of the reporting units, (f) comparison of our current financial performance to historical and budgeted results of the reporting units, (g) change in excess of the Company market capitalization over its book value, (h) changes in estimates, valuation inputs, and/or assumptions since the last quantitative analysis of the reporting units, (i) changes in the regulatory environment; (j) changes in strategic outlook or organizational structure and leadership of the reporting units; and (k) other relevant factors, and how these factors might impact specific performance in future periods. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. We also periodically review the carrying amount of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-term assets, including property and equipment and website and internal use software, to determine whether current events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we assess the recoverability of the asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset of the group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows, using an appropriate discount rate. Any impairment would be measured by the amount that the carrying values, of such asset 59 groups, exceed their fair value and would be included in operating income on the consolidated statement of operations. Considerabl e management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of asset groups. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. We have not identified any circumstances that would warrant an impairment charge for any recorded defin ite-lived intangibles or other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Income Taxes We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider all relevant factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as assessing available tax planning strategies. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheet. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. We record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into United States tax law. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering corporate income tax rates, and imposing Transition Tax. The 2017 Tax Act permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act also provided for prospective changes that began in 2018. Under GAAP, the effects of changes in income tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. We are subject to additional requirements of the 2017 Tax Act which began during the year ended December 31, 2018. Those provisions include a deduction for foreign derived intangible income ( FDII ), GILTI, a limitation of certain executive compensation, and other immaterial provisions. We have elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore included GILTI expense in the effective income tax rate calculation. Our 2018 effective income tax rate includes our estimates of these new provisions, with a net tax benefit of $5 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our estimates may be revised in future periods as we obtain additional data, and as the IRS issues new guidance implementing the law changes . Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on income taxes. 60
