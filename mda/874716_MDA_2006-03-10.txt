ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS OVERVIEW We operate primarily through three business segments: the Companion Animal Group ( CAG ), Water testing business ( Water ) and the Food Diagnostics Group ( FDG ). CAG is comprised of the following product and service categories: instruments and consumables, rapid assays, reference laboratory and consulting services, practice information management and digital radiography systems, and pharmaceuticals. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water. FDG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and contaminants in production animals and dairy products. Other items that are not included in our reportable segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development and interest income. 16 For the three years ended December 31, 2005, revenues by product and service categories were as follows (in thousands) : December 31, 2005 2004 2003 CAG revenue: Instruments and consumables $ 217,537 $ 197,939 $ 177,374 Rapid assay products 100,255 93,506 82,978 Reference laboratory and consulting services 156,425 118,596 94,650 Practice information management and digital radiography systems 32,589 28,163 22,463 Pharmaceutical products 14,024 10,483 6,954 Net CAG revenue 520,830 448,687 384,419 Net Water revenue 56,760 53,098 46,936 FDG revenue Production animal products 44,945 31,690 28,580 Dairy testing products 15,560 15,706 16,057 Net FDG revenue 60,505 47,396 44,637 Net revenue $ 638,095 $ 549,181 $ 475,992 The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business. Companion Animal Group In the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution, permits us to offer integrated disease-management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and outside laboratory testing, and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems, including connecting the electronic health record with laboratory test data, in-clinic test data from our IDEXX VetLab suite of analyzers, and radiographic data in the IDEXX-PACS software taken by our digital radiography systems. In the U.S., we sell instrument consumables, rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily through distributors, and, therefore, our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors, rather than sales to veterinarians, the end-users. Because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate, sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product. Therefore, we closely track sales of these products by our U.S. distributors to the veterinarians ( practice-level sales ), which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products. In the discussion of results below, we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced, positively or negatively, by changes in distributor inventories. Instruments and Consumables . Our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that, individually and together, provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic, enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and, in doing so, achieve their practice objectives, including growth and economic success. We derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments. During the early stage of an instrument life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. We have a large installed base of VetTest Chemistry Analyzers, and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales, although in recent years we have grown the annual number of unit instrument placements through sales, lease, rental and other programs. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes. 17 We purchase the consumables used in VetTest Chemistry Analyzers from Ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2020. This supply agreement provides us with a long-term source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010, and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume. Under this agreement, we are developing and expect to introduce a next-generation chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the Ortho dry-slide technology, and Ortho will supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the VetTest Chemistry Analyzer. We do not expect this next-generation analyzer to be commercially available before the latter part of 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we introduced the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer, which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform, the VetAutoread Hematology Analyzer. A substantial portion of LaserCyte placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our VetAutoread Hematology Analyzers. Although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables, LaserCyte consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in sales of VetAutoread consumables. Because the gross margin percentage of LaserCyte consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the VetAutoread consumables, gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer. Our gross margins on LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer sales have been low in the early years of the program due to higher manufacturing, service and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer. As we have gained experience with the analyzer, we have improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced warranty and service costs, which have improved gross margins on these products, particularly in 2005. While we expect that LaserCyte gross margins will continue to improve, they will continue to have a negative impact on overall CAG gross margins. With all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ease of use, ability to handle compromised samples, time to result, analytical capability of software, integration with the IDEXX VetLab system, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. Our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy. Rapid Assays . Our rapid assay business comprises single-use kits for in-clinic testing and microwell-based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs. As in our other lines of business, we also seek to differentiate our products through superior sales and customer service. These products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities, and which we believe do not include a similar level of support. We augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing. Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services . We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our IDEXX Reference Laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality, customer service, technology employed and specialized test menu. Revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers, including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories. In 2004, we acquired a laboratory in Columbus, Ohio, opened a laboratory in Seattle, Washington, and acquired Vet Med Lab, which is based in Germany and is the largest European veterinary reference laboratory. In 2005, we acquired laboratories in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and France and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the U.S. and Germany. Profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements. New laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating improvements. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business. 18 Practice Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems . These businesses consist of veterinary practice information management systems ( PIMS ) including hardware and software and veterinary-specific digital radiography systems. Our strategy in the PIMS business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions, backed by superior customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice business objectives. We differentiate our software systems through continually enhanced functionality through regular software releases. Our veterinary-specific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals. The digital radiography systems also incorporate IDEXX-PACS picture archiving and communication software developed by IDEXX that allows for image enhancement, manipulation, storage and retrieval, and integration with the practice information software. Our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price, backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the Companion Animal Group. Water Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important. Over the past several years, the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration. International sales of water-testing products represented 41% of total water product sales in 2005, and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe. Food Diagnostics Group Production Animal Services . We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry, cattle and swine diseases and conditions, and have an active research and development and in-licensing program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. The performance of this business, therefore, can be subject to fluctuation. In 2005, approximately 77% of our sales in this business was international. Because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally. In 2004, we received USDA approval of our postmortem test for BSE (mad cow disease) and, in February 2005, we were informed that this test was approved by the European Commission for sale in EU member countries. While BSE testing is very limited in the U.S., a larger market for BSE testing exists in Europe. Dairy Testing . Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance. These testing products use, almost exclusively, the SNAP platform and manufacturing processes of our rapid assay business, incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection. Sales of dairy testing products have declined slightly over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market. To increase sales of dairy testing products, we look to increase penetration in geographies outside the United States and in the farm segment of the dairy market, and to develop product line enhancements and extensions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventory, goodwill and other intangible assets, warranty reserves, income taxes, contingencies, and revenue recognition. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these financial statements. 19 We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Inventory Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations. Certain major components of inventory are discussed in more detail below. LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer . At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net inventories included $9.8 million and $11.9 million, respectively, of component parts and finished goods associated with our LaserCyte hematology instrument. In addition, we had firm purchase commitments for an additional $2.6 million of component parts as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $2.3 million and $1.9 million of the net LaserCyte inventory, respectively, required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the inventory subject to rework was net of $0.7 million and $0.3 million write-downs, respectively, for inventory estimated to be obsolete. We expect to fully realize our net investment in inventory and purchase commitments. However, if we alter the design of this product, we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory. VetTest Chemistry Slides . At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net inventories included $14.4 million and $22.7 million, respectively, of slides used in our VetTest Chemistry Analyzers. The decrease in slide inventory at December 31, 2005, compared to December 31, 2004, was primarily due to the delay of inventory receipts from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006. Most of the slides have a shelf-life of 24 months at the date of manufacture. The average remaining shelf-life at December 31, 2005 was 16.4 months. In addition, we are required to purchase a minimum of $92.7 million of slides from Ortho through December 31, 2010. During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, we entered into a new contract with Ortho, which extended the term of the supply agreement through 2018 and left the contract minimum purchase commitments unchanged. In June 2005, we further amended this agreement to, among other things, extend its term from 2018 to 2020. As a result of the current and projected demand for VetTest slides, our commitment to develop a next-generation chemistry analyzer that will utilize these slides, and the ratable decrease in required annual slide purchases from Ortho through 2010, we believe that we will not incur a loss under the contract. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our development commitment. Nitazoxanide . Our nitazoxanide product, Navigator , for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis ( EPM ) was approved by the FDA in November 2003. At December 31, 2005, our inventories included $9.4 million of inventory associated with Navigator , consisting of $0.2 million of finished goods and $9.2 million of active ingredient and other raw materials. In December 2004, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide under which we paid the supplier $0.9 million in January 2005 and the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longer-dated material. The payment was capitalized as inventory cost. We believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to sale. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are valued at fair value when acquired. If a market value is not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on expected cash flows of the associated business acquired that are attributable to the intangible asset. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the other net assets acquired. 20 We assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Failure to obtain regulatory approval of certain products; Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant advancements or changes in technology; and Cancellation or significant changes in contractual relationships. We continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS No. 144 ). If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. In determining expected future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups. The cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. Under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS No. 142 ), we are required to perform annual tests of goodwill for impairment or additional tests whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. For our annual impairment tests, we identify our reporting units, allocate assets and liabilities (including goodwill) to the reporting units and compare the reporting units net book value to their estimated fair value. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flow estimates used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If a reporting unit net book value exceeds its fair value, then the implied fair value of goodwill is determined. If the net book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. No impairment has been identified as a result of the annual reviews. Warranty Reserves We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenue at the time revenue is recognized. Our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical data, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had accrued $3.2 million and $3.7 million for estimated warranty expense, respectively, including warranty reserves of $2.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for LaserCyte Hematology Analyzers. Warranty expense was $2.2 million, $3.6 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the warranty liability during 2005, compared to 2004, was due to the improved reliability of the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer, partially offset by the impact of the growing installed base of LaserCyte Hematology Analyzers. The increase in warranty liability during 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the impact of the growing installed base of LaserCyte Hematology Analyzers, partially offset by a reduction of warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these instruments. We charge warranty expense to the cost of LaserCyte revenue at the time revenue is recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty period. Cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience. The reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument resulted in a reduction of $0.3 million and $0.6 million in cost of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 21 Income Taxes We account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable, respectively; and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. We consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States, the cumulative amount of which was $79.6 million at December 31, 2005. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. During 2005, we repatriated approximately $30.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and recorded a tax provision of $1.0 million related to this repatriation. Should we repatriate non-United States earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. Estimates for Certain Contingencies Under our workers compensation insurance policy for U.S. employees for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and $2.8 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in aggregate claim liability. We entered into a similar workers compensation insurance policy effective January 1, 2006. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative expenses of $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.7 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under our employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to $125,000 per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month, which was estimated to be $13.9 million at December 31, 2005. We estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care obligations based on individual and aggregate coverage, our claims experience, the number of employees enrolled in the program, and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported. Should actual employee health care claims liability exceed estimates, we are liable for up to an additional $1.7 million for potential uninsured obligations at December 31, 2005. We have insurance coverage of $1.0 million for claims above the aggregate limit. Should employee health insurance claims exceed this coverage, we would have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage. From time to time, we are notified that a claim is being made against us. We evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of that claim. If warranted, we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly. 22 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when four criteria are met. These include (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products sold through distributors, as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery to the common carrier. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the product is delivered, except as noted below. Our distributors do not have the right to return products. We recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and the customer acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no significant further obligations. We recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed. We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition. We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition. When instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus on Issue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Accordingly, the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values, which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers. The deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above. Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, or trade-in rights. Awards points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchase of our products and services. We estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on issuance of credits, points actually awarded, and estimates of points to be awarded in the future based on current revenue. For the SNAP-Up-the-Savings program, estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers. For our Practice Developer volume discount program, we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures. During 2005, we notified customers that, effective November 30, 2005, unused points awarded prior to January 1, 2004, including points issued under the SNAP-Up-the-Savings program, would be canceled and, that on November 30 of each subsequent year, unused points issued prior to January 1 of the prior year would also be canceled. The value of points canceled in 2005 was less than $0.1 million. We may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future. For trade-in rights, we have reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be traded in and the average trade-in value. We recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and the percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances might be required. 23 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 Revenue Total Company. Revenue increased $88.9 million, or 16%, to $638.1 million from $549.2 million for the prior year.

Companion Animal Group. Revenue for CAG increased $72.1 million, or 16%, to $520.8 million from $448.7 million for the prior year. Incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 and 2005, consisting of veterinary reference laboratories and a digital radiography business, contributed approximately 7% to CAG revenue growth during the period.

The following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. Because our instrument consumables, rapid assay products, and pharmaceutical products are sold in the U.S. and certain other geographies by distributors, distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices, who are the end-users. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying end-user demand for our products. Fluctuations in distributors inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end-users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth. 24 Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to the impact of practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics, we refer to the impact of changes in distributors inventories. If during the comparable period of the prior year, distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current year, then changes in distributors inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales in the current period. Conversely, if during the comparable period of the prior year, distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year, then distributors inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales in the current period. The increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to increased sales volume. The increased sales volume of consumables was due primarily to higher worldwide practice-level sales of VetTest slides. To a lesser extent, increased domestic sales of consumables used with our VetLyte Electrolyte Analyzers and higher practice-level sales of tubes used with our hematology instruments also resulted in increased sales volume of consumables. Increased VetTest chemistry and hematology consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments throughout 2004 and 2005. The increase in sales of VetLyte consumables was due, in part, to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to product unavailability, which had a favorable impact of 1% on the growth rate for instruments and consumables during 2005. Increased instrument sales volume resulted mainly from higher sales of LaserCyte Hematology Analyzers and, to a lesser extent, the launch of our VetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer. The increase in sales of rapid assay products was due primarily to increased domestic practice-level sales volume of our canine combination test, the SNAP 3Dx Canine Test, and to higher average unit sales prices for canine and feline products. The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 and, to a lesser extent, the impact of price increases and higher testing volume. Incremental sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 contributed approximately 23% to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth during 2005. The increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems resulted from increased sales volume of digital radiography instruments. The increase in digital radiography revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold, including sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of 2005. Incremental sales from this acquired business contributed approximately 7% to practice information management and digital radiography systems revenue growth during 2005. The increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from increased practice-level demand and, to a lesser extent, from price increases on certain products. We expect pharmaceutical revenue for 2006, as a percentage of 2005 revenue, to grow at a lower rate of 15% to 20%. Water. Revenue for Water increased $3.7 million, or 7%, to $56.8 million from $53.1 million for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices attributable to both greater price competition in certain geographies and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of $0.2 million, or less than 1%, to the increase in Water revenue. Food Diagnostics Group. Revenue for FDG increased $13.1 million, or 28%, to $60.5 million from $47.4 million for the prior year. Incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 contributed approximately 11% to FDG revenue growth during the year. The following table presents revenue by product and service categories for FDG: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Net Revenue (in thousands) 2005 2004 Dollar Change Percentage Change Percentage Change from Currency (1) Percentage Change Net of Currency Effect Production animal products $ 44,945 $ 31,690 $ 13,255 41 .8% (0 .3%) 42 .1% Dairy testing products 15,560 15,706 (146 ) (0 .9%) 0 .3% (1 .2%) Net FDG revenue $ 60,505 $ 47,396 $ 13,109 27 .7% (0 .1%) 27 .8% (1) Represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 to the 12 months ended December 31, 2005. 25 The following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. The increase in sales of production animal products resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume of livestock and, to a lesser extent, poultry diagnostics, including sales attributable to acquisitions in 2004. Incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 contributed approximately 17% to production animal products revenue growth during the period. The decrease in sales of dairy testing products resulted primarily from the divestiture of the Parallux product line and from lower average unit sales prices attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. These decreases were partially offset by higher unit sales of SNAP tests. Gross Profit Total Company. Gross profit increased $43.9 million, or 16%, to $322.9 million from $279.0 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of total revenue, was approximately constant at 51%. The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage by operating segment: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Gross Profit (in thousands) 2005 Percent of Sales 2004 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 250,409 48.1% $ 214,927 47.9% $ 35,482 16.5% Water 38,277 67.4% 35,885 67.6% 2,392 6.7% FDG 34,214 56.5% 28,205 59.5% 6,009 21.3% Total Company $ 322,900 50.6% $ 279,017 50.8% $ 43,883 15.7% We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment and will expense share-based compensation beginning on January 1, 2006, which will have a negative impact on our future gross profit percentages and on operating margins for all of our segments. Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased $35.5 million, or 17%, to $250.4 million from $214.9 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the CAG product lines. As a percentage of revenue, CAG gross profit was approximately constant at 48%. The gross profit percentage was positively impacted by relatively higher selling prices, particularly for laboratory and consulting services and rapid assay products; lower product and service costs associated with the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer and lower product cost of slides sold for use in our VetTest Chemistry Analyzers under the agreement with our supplier; and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses. The increases in the gross profit percentage were largely offset by higher overall net product and service costs, apart from the favorable LaserCyte and slide costs mentioned above; greater relative sales of lower margin products and services, mainly from higher sales growth of laboratory services; and write-downs of excess pharmaceutical product inventory. Water. Gross profit for Water increased $2.4 million, or 7%, to $38.3 million from $35.9 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume, partly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage to 67% from 68%. The gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by costs related to a manufacturing issue during the third quarter of 2005 and by lower average unit sales prices. These decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses. Food Diagnostics Group. Gross profit for FDG increased $6.0 million, or 21%, to $34.2 million from $28.2 million for the prior year due to increased sales volume, partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 57% from 60%. During the same period of the prior year, a reduction of approximately $1.8 million in an estimated liability for a third party claim was accounted for as a reduction in cost of revenue and increased the 2004 gross profit percentage by four percentage points. For 2005, an unfavorable impact on the gross margin percentage of two percentage points was attributable to incremental acquisition integration costs. The gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products and by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses, partially offset by higher net product costs. 26 Operating Expenses and Operating Income Total Company. Total operating expenses increased $36.6 million to $207.6 million from $171.0 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased to 33% from 31% for the prior year. Operating income increased $7.3 million to $115.3 million from $108.0 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating income decreased to 18% from 20%. During 2005, operating income was reduced by acquisition integration costs associated with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005, including costs incurred in connection with the centralization of our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern, Switzerland. During 2004, operating income benefited from the settlement of a third party claim, described above, and a payment received in settlement of litigation, partly offset by acquisition integration costs. These discrete items in both years resulted in a reported decrease in operating income as a percentage of total company revenue of one percentage point. The remaining difference in the operating income percentage for 2005, compared to the prior year, was attributable, in part, to the expansion of the CAG sales, customer service and marketing organization during 2004 and the first half of 2005; amortization expense for intangible assets purchased in connection with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005; and other changes in gross profit and operating expenses described in this narrative. The following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Operating Expenses (in thousands) 2005 Percent of Sales 2004 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 167,439 32.1% $ 137,804 30.7% $ 29,635 21.5% Water 12,303 21.7% 11,626 21.9% 677 5.8% FDG 24,320 40.2% 18,374 38.8% 5,946 32.4% Other 3,507 N/A 3,178 N/A 329 10.3% Total Company $ 207,569 32.5% $ 170,982 31.1% $ 36,587 21.4% Operating Income (in thousands) 2005 Percent of Sales 2004 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 82,970 15.9% $ 77,123 17.2% $ 5,847 7.6% Water 25,974 45.8% 24,259 45.7% 1,715 7.1% FDG 9,894 16.4% 9,831 20.7% 63 0.6% Other (3,507 ) N/A (3,178 ) N/A (329 ) (10.3% ) Total Company $ 115,331 18.1% $ 108,035 19.7% $ 7,296 6.8% Companion Animal Group. Operating expenses for CAG increased $29.6 million, or 22%, to $167.4 million from $137.8 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 32% from 31%. The increase was attributable to a 21% ($15.1 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a 25% ($10.1 million) increase in general and administrative expense, and a 17% ($4.4 million) increase in research and development expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the expansion of the worldwide sales, customer service and marketing organization; ongoing expenses attributable to the Vet Med Lab business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and, to a lesser extent, the digital radiography business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 and higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses attributable to businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005, comprised of general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature, amortization expense for intangible assets acquired, and integration costs. To a lesser extent, the increase in general and administrative expense was also attributable to higher spending on information technology and other general support functions; the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses; and the positive impact in 2004 of a payment received in the second quarter of 2004 to settle certain litigation. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased spending related to instrument development and, to a lesser extent, rapid assay and pharmaceutical product development. 27 Water. Operating expenses for Water increased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $12.3 million from $11.6 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, were approximately constant at 22%. The dollar increase was attributable to a 13% ($0.6 million) increase in general and administrative expense and a 12% ($0.2 million) increase in research and development expense, partly offset by a 2% ($0.1 million) decrease in sales and marketing expense. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions, and, to a lesser extent, from the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased spending on Cryptosporidium testing product development. There were no significant individual events or fluctuations in the nature and amounts of sales and marketing expense. Food Diagnostics Group. Operating expenses for FDG increased $5.9 million, or 32%, to $24.3 million from $18.4 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 40% from 39%. The increase resulted from a 72% ($4.0 million) increase in general and administrative expense, a 16% ($1.3 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, and a 13% ($0.6 million) increase in research and development expense. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses associated with the acquisition of Bommeli in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the subsequent centralization of our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern, Switzerland. These costs are composed mainly of general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the Bommeli business, costs related to the cessation of production in our Sweden-based facility, and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired. To a lesser extent, higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the addition of Bommeli sales and marketing activities and from sales and marketing costs to support the launch of our HerdChek BSE Antigen Test Kit. The increase in research and development expense was due primarily to the addition of Bommeli research and development activities and to higher compensation costs, partly offset by reduced development activity following the launch of our HerdChek BSE Antigen Test Kit. Other. Operating expenses, consisting primarily of corporate research and development, increased $0.3 million, or 10%, to $3.5 million from $3.2 million for the prior year due mainly to increased long-term development activities. Interest Income Net interest income was $3.1 million for 2005 and 2004. The impact of higher interest rates was substantially offset by the impact of lower average invested cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of this rate differential resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2004 of an IRS income tax audit through the year 2001. As a result of completing this audit, we reduced previously accrued taxes. Other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates. In addition, 2005 tax expense increased by $1.0 million and the 2005 effective income tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points due to incremental taxes on the repatriation of $30.0 million pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 . 28 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2003 Revenue Total Company. Revenue for the total company increased $73.2 million, or 15%, to $549.2 million from $476.0 million in the same period of the prior year. The following table presents revenue for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Net Revenue (in thousands) 2004 2003 Dollar Change Percentage Change Percentage Change from Currency (1) Percentage Change Net of Currency Effect CAG $ 448,687 $ 384,419 $ 64,268 16 .7% 2 .7% 14 .0% Water 53,098 46,936 6,162 13 .1% 4 .0% 9 .1% FDG 47,396 44,637 2,759 6 .2% 5 .4% 0 .8% Total Company $ 549,181 $ 475,992 $ 73,189 15 .4% 3 .1% 12 .3% (1) Represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 to the 12 months ended December 31, 2004. Companion Animal Group. Revenue for CAG increased $64.3 million, or 17%, to $448.7 million from $384.4 million in the same period of the prior year. The following table presents revenue by product and service categories for CAG: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Net Revenue (in thousands) 2004 2003 Dollar Change Percentage Change Percentage Change from Currency (1) Percentage Change Net of Currency Effect Instruments and consumables $ 197,939 $ 177,374 $ 20,565 11.6% 3.9% 7.7% Rapid assay products 93,506 82,978 10,528 12.7% 1.2% 11.5% Reference laboratory and consulting services 118,596 94,650 23,946 25.3% 2.9% 22.4% Practice information management and digital radiography systems 28,163 22,463 5,700 25.4% 0.3% 25.1% Pharmaceutical products 10,483 6,954 3,529 50.8% --% 50.8% Net CAG Revenue $ 448,687 $ 384,419 $ 64,268 16.7% 2.7% 14.0% (1) Represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 to the 12 months ended December 31, 2004. The following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. The increase in sales of instruments and consumables (an increase of $20.6 million, or 12%) was due mainly to increased sales volume, including higher domestic practice-level sales of VetTest slides and, to a lesser extent, tubes used with our hematology instruments, as well as higher volume outside the U.S.; the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.; increased instrument sales, due primarily to increased sales of the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer; and the impact of changes in distributors inventory levels. Increased consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments during 2003 and 2004. Shipments to distributors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were reduced as a result of the Company continuing efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel. The reduced shipments during 2003 had a positive impact on sales growth in the 2004 period. The collective impact of favorable currency exchange and favorable comparisons resulting from lower distributor purchases in 2003 caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying practice-level growth of instruments and consumables. 29 The increase in sales of rapid assay products (an increase of $10.5 million, or 13%) was due primarily to increased domestic practice-level sales volume of canine and, to a lesser extent, feline products, as well as demand for our SNAP test to screen dogs and cats for Giardia infection, which was launched during the first quarter of 2004; the impact of changes in distributors inventory levels; and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. Shipments to distributors during 2003 were reduced as a result of the Company efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel, which contributed to a reported sales growth in the 2004 period. The collective impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and favorable currency exchange caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying practice-level growth of rapid assay products. The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services (an increase of $23.9 million, or 25%) resulted primarily from higher testing volume at established laboratories, mainly in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom and Australia; the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in late 2003 and in 2004; and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the U.S. and higher pricing. The increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems (an increase of $5.7 million, or 25%), resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales and increased hardware sales and placements of digital radiography systems, partly offset by lower service sales. The increase in sales of pharmaceutical products (an increase of $3.5 million, or 51%) resulted in part from sales of new products launched in 2003 and 2004. Water. Revenue for Water increased $6.2 million, or 13%, to $53.1 million from $46.9 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S., partly offset by lower average unit prices due to price competition in certain foreign countries and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $1.9 million, or 4%, to the increase in Water revenue. Food Diagnostics Group. Revenue for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 6%, to $47.4 million from $44.6 million for the same period of the prior year. Businesses acquired during 2004 contributed approximately 1% to FDG revenue growth during the year. The following table presents revenue by product and service categories for FDG: For the Twelves Months Ended December 31, Net Revenue (in thousands) 2004 2003 Dollar Change Percentage Change Percentage Change from Currency (1) Percentage Change Net of Currency Effect Production animal products $ 31,690 $ 28,580 $ 3,110 10 .9% 6 .1% 4 .8% Dairy testing products 15,706 16,057 (351 ) (2 .2%) 4 .1% (6 .3%) Net FDG revenue $ 47,396 $ 44,637 $ 2,759 6 .2% 5 .4% 0 .8% (1) Represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 to the 12 months ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. and higher sales volume of production animal diagnostics. These increases were partly offset by lower average unit prices of production animal diagnostics and dairy-testing products, and by decreased sales volume of dairy-testing products. The increase in production animal diagnostics sales was due to increased sales volume of livestock products outside the U.S. The lower average unit prices were attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and, to a lesser extent, to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $2.4 million, or 5%, to the increase in FDG revenue. 30 Gross Profit Total Company. Gross profit for the total company increased $48.7 million, or 21%, to $279.0 million from $230.3 million for the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of total company revenue, gross profit increased to 51% in 2004 from 48% in 2003. The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Gross Profit (in thousands) 2004 Percent of Sales 2003 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 214,927 47.9% $ 175,612 45.7% $ 39,315 22.4% Water 35,885 67.6% 31,483 67.1% 4,402 14.0% FDG 28,205 59.5% 23,209 52.0% 4,996 21.5% Total Company $ 279,017 50.8% $ 230,304 48.4% $ 48,713 21.2% Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased $39.3 million, or 22%, to $214.9 million from $175.6 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the CAG product lines and to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of CAG revenue, gross profit increased to 48% from 46% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to productivity improvements across CAG product lines and services; the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses; and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing from our supplier of slide consumables compared to the same period of the prior year. The productivity improvements were partly due to manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in service costs related to our LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer and, to a lesser extent, to fixed costs spread over a higher revenue base. The LaserCyte service cost improvements generated a favorable change in our accruals for cost of product warranties and extended maintenance agreements for all placed instruments for which we have such future obligations. These increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage recognized from laboratories acquired in 2004, including due to the purchase accounting impact of writing off supplies and, to a lesser extent, by other laboratory service expansion costs, including start-up costs of laboratories opened in the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2004. Water. Gross profit for Water increased $4.4 million, or 14%, to $35.9 million from $31.5 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased revenue. As a percentage of Water revenue, gross profit increased to 68% from 67% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses. Food Diagnostics Group. Gross profit for FDG increased $5.0 million, or 22%, to $28.2 million from $23.2 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of FDG revenue, gross profit increased to 60% from 52% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reductions in an accrual related to a third-party claim resulting from the settlement of that claim and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses, partly offset by unfavorable product costs. The reduction in the accrual for the third-party claim resulted in an aggregate benefit recognized in 2004 of $1.8 million or a four-percentage-point increase in the gross margin percentage. The unfavorable product costs were due to fixed costs spread over lower production volume in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the impact of expensing a portion of the purchase accounting fair market value adjustment of inventory obtained in connection with the 2004 acquisitions. 31 Operating Expenses Total Company. Total company operating expenses increased $21.1 million to $171.0 million from $149.9 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses remained relatively constant at 31%. The following tables present operating expenses and operating income for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Operating Expenses (in thousands) 2004 Percent of Sales 2003 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 137,804 30.7% $ 120,396 31.3% $ 17,408 14.5% Water 11,626 21.9% 10,549 22.5% 1,077 10.2% FDG 18,374 38.8% 15,603 35.0% 2,771 17.8% Other 3,178 N/A 3,369 N/A (191 ) (5.7% ) Total Company $ 170,982 31.1% $ 149,917 31.5% $ 21,065 14.1% Operating Income (in thousands) 2004 Percent of Sales 2003 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 77,123 17.2% $ 55,216 14.4% $ 21,907 39.7% Water 24,259 45.7% 20,934 44.6% 3,325 15.9% FDG 9,831 20.7% 7,606 17.0% 2,225 29.3% Other (3,178 ) N/A (3,369 ) N/A 191 5.7% Total Company $ 108,035 19.7% $ 80,387 16.9% $ 27,648 34.4% Companion Animal Group. Operating expenses for CAG increased $17.4 million, or 14%, to $137.8 million from $120.4 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at 31% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was attributable to a 23% ($13.4 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a 10% ($2.4 million) increase in research and development expense, and a 4% ($1.6 million) increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased sales and sales support personnel and marketing program costs; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and, to a lesser extent, expenses associated with the Vet Med Lab acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased staffing and higher spending to support instrument and pharmaceutical product development. The increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; expenses associated with laboratory acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, including amortization of intangible assets; and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses, partly offset by the nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the write-down of fixed assets of $7.4 million associated with the discontinuation of development of a clinical chemistry instrument. In October 2003, we extended our relationship with Ortho, the supplier of our VetTest slides. We committed to develop a next-generation clinical chemistry system based on Ortho dry-slide technology and discontinued efforts to develop the alternative system. Water. Operating expenses for Water increased $1.1 million, or 10%, to $11.6 million from $10.5 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at 22% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was attributable to a 25% ($0.8 million) increase in general and administrative expense, a 7% ($0.1 million) increase in research and development expense, and a 2% ($0.1 million) increase in sales and marketing expense. The increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and the impact of a gain from a legal settlement in 2003 that was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense. There were no significant fluctuations in the nature and amounts of research and development expense or of sales and marketing expense. 32 Food Diagnostics Group. Operating expenses for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 18%, to $18.4 million from $15.6 million in the same period of the prior year and, as a percent of sales, increased to 39% from 35% in the same period of the prior year. The increase was attributable to a 25% ($1.1 million) increase in general and administrative expense, a 14% ($0.6 million) increase in research and development expense, a 5% ($0.3 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, and a $0.7 million decrease in other income. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from ongoing expenses associated with the China joint venture formed in 2003; higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and expenses associated with the Bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher compensation costs for additional personnel; increased spending in support of our HerdChek BSE Antigen Test Kit; and integration expenses associated with the Bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased spending in support of our HerdChek BSE Antigen Test Kit and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency-denominated expenses, partly offset by the nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the formation of the China joint venture. The decrease in other income results from the nonrecurrence in 2004 of the reduction in an accrual related to a third-party claim recorded as other income in 2003. Other. Operating expenses for 2004, consisting primarily of corporate research and development, decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, to $3.2 million from $3.4 million for the same period of the prior year. Interest Income Net interest income was $3.1 million for 2004 compared with $2.9 million during 2003. The increase in interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The majority of this rate reduction resulted from the resolution in 2004 of an IRS income tax audit through the year 2001. As a result of completing this audit, the Company reduced previously accrued taxes. Other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates, partially offset by revisions in 2003 to international tax estimates and a charge to write-down fixed assets occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2(p) to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity We fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had $132.7 million and $137.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively, and working capital of $192.7 million and $201.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had long-term investments, primarily in municipal bonds, of $19.7 million. We consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Subject to this policy, we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. While the repatriation of foreign earnings could have adverse tax consequences, foreign cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. We believe that current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs. 33 Sources and Uses of Cash Cash provided by operating activities was $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $95.4 million for 2004. In 2005, cash increased $10.7 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, whereas in 2004 cash decreased by $13.6 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, resulting in a year-to-year change of $24.4 million. The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities, compared to 2004, was attributable to incremental changes in cash provided by accrued liabilities of $15.6 million, accounts payable of $10.7 million, and inventories of $6.7 million, partly offset by incremental uses of cash attributable to accounts receivable of $4.1 million and to other assets and liabilities of $4.5 million. The increase in accrued expenses was due to the impact of higher income tax accruals in 2005, compared to 2004, and the impact of higher accruals for points granted to customers under our Practice Developer volume discount program in 2005, compared to 2004. The higher income tax accruals were due in part to the rate reduction in 2004 resulting from the resolution of an IRS income tax audit through the year 2001, which lowered the accrual in 2004 relative to 2005, and the impact of differences in the timing of expense recognition in the financial statements compared to income tax deductibility. The incremental cash generated from accounts payable was due primarily to the timing of payments to vendors, including contractual purchase commitments to Ortho for VetTest slides. The incremental cash generated from inventory was due to lower inventories of VetTest slides and LaserCyte Hematology Analyzers, partially offset by higher VetAutoread instrument and consumable inventory. The decrease in the VetTest slide inventory was due to the deferral of receipts of slides from Ortho from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006. The decrease in cash to fund accounts receivable was due to higher sales. The $5.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005. Cash provided by investing activities was $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to cash used by investing activities of $36.8 million for 2004. The increase in cash provided by investing activities for 2005, compared to 2004, was primarily due to the reduction in cash used for acquisitions. In 2005, we utilized cash of $7.6 million to acquire veterinary reference laboratories in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and France, a veterinary laboratory customer list in the U.S. and a digital radiography business. In 2004, we used $53.9 million to purchase veterinary reference laboratories in the U.S. and Germany and production animal diagnostic companies in the U.S. and Switzerland. We generated $44.3 million from net sales of short- and long-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $48.9 million in 2004. Since 1999, the Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to 16,000,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2005, we had 2,052,000 shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 1,993,000 shares of our common stock for $123.8 million at an average price of $62.11 per share. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 13,948,000, 11,955,000, and 9,541,000 cumulative shares, respectively, had been repurchased under this program. During 2004 and 2003, the Company received approximately 1,000 and 133,000 shares of stock, respectively, which were owned by the holders for greater than six months, in payment for the exercise price of stock options. The shares of stock had a fair market value of $0.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. Commitments Effective January 1, 2003, we entered into a workers compensation insurance policy for U.S. employees under which we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and up to specific limits, based on payroll, in claim liability in the aggregate. We have entered into similar workers compensation policies effective January 1, 2004, and 2005. The insurance company administers and pays these claims, and we reimburse the insurance company for our portion of these claims. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. In connection with these policies, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.6 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims at December 31, 2005. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. We purchased $24.2 million in fixed assets and $2.6 million in rental instruments sold under recourse during the year ended December 31, 2005, principally related to the CAG segment. Our total capital budget for 2006 for fixed assets and rental instruments is approximately $37.0 million. 34 We have a 40% equity interest in a joint venture formed to assemble and market veterinary diagnostic products for production animals in China. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we made capital contributions of $0.6 million to the joint venture. We agreed to purchase an additional 55% equity interest in the joint venture from our partner, subject to approval by the Chinese government of the ownership change, and committed to pay $0.8 million over two years in consideration for the additional equity. In addition, the joint venture entered into a contract with the joint venture partner where the partner will provide promotional and agency services and will receive sales commissions at rates escalating from 2.5% to 8.5% annually based on sales volume. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. In January 2006, we entered into an agreement to purchase the building in which our headquarters facility is located for $18.0 million less the face value of the existing mortgage of $6.5 million and also agreed to assume the mortgage. The closing is subject to certain conditions to closing, including completion of our due diligence review and receipt of certain state and local incentives. In addition, we expect to incur an estimated additional $20 million over the next two years primarily to renovate the unoccupied portion of the building for the purpose of expanding our research and development, manufacturing and office space. The purchase of the headquarters facility and subsequent renovation is in addition to the 2006 capital budget. Under the terms of certain supply agreements with suppliers of our veterinary instruments, slides for our VetTest Chemistry Analyzers; electrolyte instruments, components and consumables; our VetAutoread Hematology Analyzers, components and consumables; and certain raw materials, we have aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $138.7 million of products through 2020. In addition, we have various minimum royalty payments due through 2019 of $13.5 million. We committed up to an aggregate of $4.0 million of capital purchase obligations in connection with the design and construction of automated production equipment at Ortho facility that will be used to manufacture consumables for use in our next-generation chemistry analyzer. We expect to pay $1.9 million of our total commitment in 2006, $1.2 million in 2007 and the remainder in 2008. In October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread Hematology Analyzers and consumables sold this business (including the human hematology testing products division) and we simultaneously entered into a new supply agreement for veterinary products with QBCD, the acquirer of the business. Under this new supply agreement, we received fixed pricing on certain products through December 31, 2020. In partial consideration for this new supply agreement, we paid cash of $2.5 million to QBCD and guaranteed QBCD note in the principal amount of $3.5 million given to our former supplier in partial consideration for the business. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K. We are required to make the following payments in the years below: (in thousands) Total 2006 2007-2008 2009-2010 After 2010 Minimum royalty payments $ 13,537 $ 1,207 $ 3,241 $ 3,057 $ 6,032 Operating leases 45,890 7,608 12,348 9,231 16,703 Unconditional purchase obligations (1) 138,668 61,145 49,192 21,198 7,133 Total contractual cash obligations $ 198,095 $ 69,960 $ 64,781 $ 33,486 $ 29,868 (1) Of this amount, $92.7 million represents our minimum purchase obligation under our VetTest slide supply agreement with Ortho.
