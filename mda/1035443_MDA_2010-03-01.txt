ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described below in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a publicly traded REIT focused principally on science-driven cluster formation. We are the leading provider of high-quality environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure services and capital to the broad and diverse life science industry. Client tenants include institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, product, service and translational entities, as well as government agencies. Our operating platform is based on the principle of clustering, with assets and operations located in key life science markets. In 2009, we: Executed 142 leases for 1,864,000 rentable square feet. Reported occupancy at 94% as of December 31, 2009. Entered into a 15-year lease with Eli Lilly and Company as an anchor tenant at the Alexandria Center TM for Life Science New York City. Leased 310,000 rentable square feet of redevelopment and development space. Completed ground-up development of one property at Mission Bay, San Francisco aggregating 102,000 rentable square feet pursuant to a 15-year lease with Pfizer Inc. Reduced principal balances of secured notes payable by $267 million. Completed redevelopment of multiple spaces at 10 properties aggregating 227,000 rentable square feet of which approximately 72% was leased. Closed 10-year secured loan for $120 million. Sold four properties for approximately $21 million. Closed two follow-on common stock offerings with aggregate net proceeds of $488 million. Closed private offering of 8.00% unsecured convertible notes with net proceeds of $233 million. Repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, approximately $75 million (par value) of our 3.70% unsecured convertible notes. Received LEED gold certification for a building in the San Diego market. 2009 demonstrated the strength and durability of our core operations providing office/laboratory space to the broad and diverse life science industry. Our core operating results were relatively steady for the year ended December 31, 2009, during the continuing extraordinary and unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and credit market crisis, significant worldwide economic recession and the drastic decline in consumer confidence and the consumer driven economy. Financial systems throughout the world have recently experienced significant periods of illiquidity with banks much less willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers. The economic, financial and banking environment and consumer confidence have improved since the depth of the crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. Even with the recent improvements, we remain cautious regarding the economic, financial and banking environment. We intend to continue to focus on the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately 575,152 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects aggregating approximately an additional 980,000 rentable square feet. Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up/vertical above ground development in 32 order to preserve and create value for these projects. These important preconstruction activities add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings. We also intend to be very careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up/vertical developments. Future ground-up/vertical development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high quality and/or credit entities. We also intend to continue to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital structure over a multi-year period. During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt maturities. We expect the source of funds for construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be provided over several years by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures, cash flows from operations, new secured or unsecured debt and the issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2009, we had identified three assets as held for sale, which have been classified in discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had 156 properties containing approximately 11.8 million rentable square feet of office/laboratory space including approximately 575,152 rentable square feet of space undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment, including the conversion of single tenancy space to multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy space. As of that date, our properties were approximately 94.1% leased, excluding spaces at properties undergoing redevelopment. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, our asset base contained properties undergoing ground-up development approximating 980,000 rentable square feet. The following table is a summary of our properties as of December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Number of Rentable Square Feet Annualized Occupancy Percentage Markets Properties Operating Redevelopment Total Base Rent (1) (1)(2) California San Diego 32 1,549,044 116,431 1,665,475 $ 41,454 89.2% California San Francisco Bay 18 1,580,943 - 1,580,943 53,949 95.4 Eastern Massachusetts 36 3,064,693 245,308 3,310,001 110,973 94.3 New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia 8 459,904 - 459,904 9,601 88.0 Southeast 13 735,373 21,191 756,564 16,364 93.7 Suburban Washington, D.C. 30 2,255,381 192,222 2,447,603 47,120 94.3 Washington Seattle 12 975,121 - 975,121 30,044 99.1 International Canada 4 342,394 - 342,394 8,158 100.0 Properties Continuing Operations 153 10,962,853 575,152 11,538,005 $ 317,663 94.1% Properties Discontinued Operations 3 221,638 - 221,638 Properties Total 156 11,184,491 575,152 11,759,643 (1) Annualized base rent means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2009 (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP). Amounts exclude spaces at properties totaling approximately 575,152 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment. (2) Including spaces undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment, occupancy as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 89.4%. Our primary sources of revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries (consisting of reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses from certain tenants) from leases of our properties. The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property development, redevelopment and acquisition activities. Of the 156 properties owned as of December 31, 2008, two were acquired in 2008 (the 2008 Properties ), 15 in 2007, 119 prior to 2007. In addition, we completed the development of one property in 2009, one property in 2007 (together with the 15 properties acquired in 2007, the 2007 Properties ) and 18 properties prior to 2007. As a result of these development and acquisition activities, as well as our ongoing redevelopment and leasing activities, there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2009 as compared to 2008 as well as 2008 as compared to 2007. Our operating expenses generally consist of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses. 33 Leasing As of December 31, 2009, approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. In addition, approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Additionally, approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures, and approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. The following table summarizes information with respect to the lease expirations at our properties as of December 31, 2009: Year of Lease Expiration Number of Leases Expiring Rentable Square Footage of Expiring Leases Percentage of Aggregate Total Rentable Square Feet Annualized Base Rent of Expiring Leases (per rentable square foot) 2010 78 (1) 1,003,316 (1) 8.7 % $24.31 2011 79 1,747,901 15.1 28.02 2012 66 1,366,663 11.8 32.82 2013 49 953,388 8.3 29.92 2014 49 1,105,663 9.6 28.31 2015 32 664,559 5.8 26.55 2016 18 1,037,632 9.0 31.65 2017 13 684,973 5.9 34.63 2018 11 737,172 6.4 44.60 2019 6 254,703 2.2 34.64 (1) Excludes three month-to-month leases for approximately 2,000 rentable square feet. Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its lease. Also, if tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Consequently, we could lose the cash flow from the affected properties, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties. Value Add Activities Construction in progress includes the following value add activities as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Value Add Activities Amount Square Feet Redevelopment projects $ 135,521 575,152 Development projects 407,084 980,000 Preconstruction projects 617,964 5,229,000 New markets and other projects 240,226 1,057,000 Total $ 1,400,795 7,841,152 Amounts are classified as construction in progress as required under GAAP while construction activities are ongoing to bring the asset to its intended use. When construction activities cease, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental properties, net or land held for future development. A key component of our business model is our value add redevelopment and development programs. These programs are focused on providing high quality generic office/laboratory space to meet the real estate requirements and are reusable by various life science industry tenants. Upon completion, each value add project is expected to generate significant revenues and cash flows. Our redevelopment and development projects are generally in locations highly desirable by life science entities which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms and higher rental income and returns. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse and shell space into generic office/ laboratory space, including the conversion of single tenancy space to multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy space. Our investment in redevelopment projects generally range from $75-150 per square foot depending on the nature of the existing building improvement and office/laboratory design. Development projects consist of the ground-up development of generic office/laboratory facilities. We also have certain significant value add projects undergoing important 34 and substantial preconstruction activities to bring these assets to their intended use. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these land parcels will provide valuable opportunities for new ground-up construction projects. The projects will provide high quality facilities for the life science industry and will generate significant revenue and cash flows for the Company. See Item 2. Properties for additional information and tables summarizing our properties undergoing redevelopment, development and preconstruction activities as of December 31, 2009. A component of our business model also includes ground-up development projects in new markets and other unique projects. We have two development parcels in China. One development parcel is located in South China where a two-building project aggregating approximately 275,000 rentable square feet is under construction. The second development parcel is located in North China where a two-building project aggregating approximately 272,000 rentable square feet is under construction. Additionally, other projects include construction related to site work, plaza, park and underground parking at the Alexandria Center TM for Life Science New York City, a unique one-of-a-kind highly advanced state-of-the-art urban science park in the city and in the adjoining future building approximating 410,000 rentable square feet. Our success with our redevelopment, development and preconstruction projects depends on many risks that may adversely affect our business, including those associated with: negative worldwide economic, financial and banking conditions; worldwide economic recession and lack of confidence; the seizure or illiquidity of credit markets; national, local and worldwide economic conditions; delays in construction; budget overruns; lack of availability and/or increasing costs of materials; commodity pricing of building materials and supplies; financing availability; changes in the life sciences, financial and banking industries; volatility in interest rates; labor availability and/or strikes; uncertainty of leasing; timing of the commencement of rental payments; changes in local submarket conditions; delays or denials of entitlements or permits; and other property development uncertainties. In addition, redevelopment, development and preconstruction activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion of management time and attention. This may distract management from focusing on other operational activities. If we are unable to complete redevelopment, development and preconstruction projects successfully, our business may be adversely affected. 35 Critical accounting policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. REIT compliance We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Rental properties, net, land held for future development and construction in progress In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued new accounting literature with respect to business combinations. We prospectively adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2009. In accordance with the new guidance, we recognize assets acquired (including the intangible value to above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an as if vacant basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. In addition, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Prior to the adoption of the new guidance related to business combinations, the purchase price was allocated based upon relative fair values and acquisition-related costs on successful acquisitions were capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets acquired. 36 The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease or 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified as leasing costs, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases. Rental properties, land held for future development, construction in progress and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount. Impairment indicators for our rental properties, land held for future development and construction in progress are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Capitalization of costs We are required to capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment or construction of a project. Capitalization of construction, development and redevelopment costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should development, redevelopment or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed. Accounting for investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in publicly traded companies are considered available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of total equity. The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other income. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities operating and financial policies. Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%. Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions exist that may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate its fair value. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. We use significant other observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs to determine the fair value of privately held entities. 37 Interest rate hedge agreements We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate hedge agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. Our objectives in using interest rate hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate cap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. We record our interest rate hedge agreements on the consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in total equity. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based up on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate hedge agreements are considered cash flow hedges as they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. All of our interest rate hedge agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate hedge agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate hedge agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities (also referred to as significant other observable inputs ). The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value of our interest rate cap agreement is determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate cap agreement. The variable interest rate used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap agreement is based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements. In adjusting the fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements for the effect of non-performance risk, we have considered any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized. 38 Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. Discontinued operations A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as held for sale, its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as held for sale. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale. Impact of recently issued accounting standards In January 2010, the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) to address implementation issues associated with the accounting for decreases in the ownership of a subsidiary. The new guidance clarified the scope of the entities covered by the guidance related to accounting for decreases in the ownership of a subsidiary and specifically excluded in-substance real estate or conveyances of oil and gas mineral rights from the scope. Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures required for a business combination achieved in stages and deconsolidation of a business or nonprofit activity. The new guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 31, 2009 and must be applied on a retrospective basis to the first period that an entity adopted the new guidance related to noncontrolling interests. The adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued an ASU to address diversity in practice related to the accounting for a distribution to shareholders that offers them the ability to elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent value with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that shareholders can elect to receive in the aggregate. The new guidance clarifies that the stock portion of a distribution to shareholders that allows them to elect to receive cash or shares with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all shareholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a share issuance that is reflected in earnings per share prospectively as opposed to a stock dividend that is retroactively applied by restating shares outstanding and earnings per share for all periods presented. The new guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 31, 2009 and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 39 In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification ) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting literature with respect to the consolidation of variable interest entities ( VIEs ). The new guidance impacts the consolidation guidance applicable to VIEs and among other things require a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, continuous assessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and enhanced disclosures about a company involvement with a VIE. The new guidance applies to our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2010 and early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued new accounting literature with respect to subsequent events. The new guidance, among other things, clarifies accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued. We adopted the new guidance effective April 1, 2009 and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Results of operations Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008 Rental revenues increased by $25.1 million, or 7%, to $366.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $341.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted from rental revenue from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008 and increases in rental rates related to renewed and/or releasable space leased. Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, we recognized additional rental income aggregating $18.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively, primarily related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San Francisco, California. Tenant recoveries increased by $2.8 million, or 3%, to $102.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted primarily from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 88% and 89%, respectively, of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. Other income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $11.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest, investment income and storage income. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 also includes a $7.2 million cash payment related to real estate acquired in November 2007. Excluding this cash payment, the decrease in other income is primarily due to decreases in investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Rental operating expenses increased by $8.5 million, or 8%, to $120.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $112.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily payroll, property taxes and insurance) from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008. The majority of the increase in rental operating expenses was recoverable from our tenants. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 4%, to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2009 remained consistent with 2008 at approximately 8%. Interest expense decreased by $2.8 million, or 3%, to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $84.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease resulted from a decrease in LIBOR rates and a decrease in the outstanding balance on our unsecured line of credit partially offset by the issuance of our 8% unsecured convertible notes. The weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge agreements, decreased from approximately 4.30% as of December 31, 2008 to approximately 4.10% as of December 31, 2009. We have entered into certain interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Hedge Agreements ). 40 Depreciation and amortization increased by $10.5 million, or 10%, to $116.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the improvements and properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008. During 2009, we recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $11.3 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $75 million (par value) of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes. During 2008, we recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain investments below their carrying value. Income from discontinued operations, net of approximately $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2009 and four properties sold during 2009. In connection with the properties sold in 2009, we recorded a gain of approximately $2.6 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of approximately $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2009, four properties sold during 2009 and eight properties sold during 2008. In connection with the properties sold in 2008, we recorded a gain of approximately $20.4 million. We also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.7 million in March 2008 related to an industrial building located in a suburban submarket south of Boston and an office building located in the San Diego market which has been included in income from discontinued operations, net. These properties were sold later in 2008. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007 Rental revenues increased by $47.6 million, or 16%, to $341.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $293.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted from rental revenue from properties acquired, placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2007 and increases in rental rates related to renewed and/or releasable space leased. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized additional rental income aggregating $11.3 million primarily related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San Francisco, California. Tenant recoveries increased by $19.1 million, or 24%, to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted primarily from properties acquired, placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 89% and 88%, respectively, of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. Other income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $11.2 million and $14.7 million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest, investment income and storage income. As a percentage of total revenues, other income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 remained relatively consistent at approximately 2% to 4% of total revenues. Rental operating expenses increased by $17.1 million, or 18%, to $112.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily property taxes and utilities) from properties acquired, placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2007. The majority of the increase in rental operating expenses was recoverable from our tenants. General and administrative expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 8%, to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including internationally. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 remained consistent with the year ended December 31, 2007 at approximately 8%. Interest expense decreased by $8.2 million, or 9%, to $84.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit due to the issuance of 10.0 million shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in March and April 2008. Additionally, the decrease resulted from a decrease in LIBOR rates. These decreases were partially offset by increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit. These borrowings were utilized to finance the development, redevelopment and acquisition of the 2007 Properties and 2008 Properties. The weighted average interest rate 41 on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge agreements, decreased from approximately 5.85% as of December 31, 2007 to approximately 4.30% as of December 31, 2008. We have entered into certain interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Hedge Agreements ). Depreciation and amortization increased by $13.5 million, or 15%, to $106.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the improvements and properties acquired, placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2007. During 2008, we recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain investments below their carrying value. Income from discontinued operations, net of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2009, four properties sold in 2009 and eight properties sold during 2008. In connection with the properties sold in 2008, we recorded a gain of approximately $20.4 million. We also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.7 million in March 2008 related to an industrial building located in a suburban submarket south of Boston and an office building located in the San Diego market, which has been included in income from discontinued operations, net. These properties were sold later in 2008. Income from discontinued operations, net of $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2009, four properties sold in 2009, eight properties sold during 2008, and four properties and four land parcels sold during 2007. In connection with the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a gain of approximately $8.0 million. 42 Liquidity and capital resources Overview We expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. We also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. We expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements, such as for property development, redevelopment and other construction projects, scheduled debt maturities and non-recurring capital improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, long term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. Notwithstanding our expectations, financial markets have recently experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. While this condition has occurred initially within the subprime mortgage lending sector of the credit market, financial systems throughout the world have recently highlighted significant periods of illiquidity with banks much less willing to lend substantial amounts to other banks and borrowers. Consequently, there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing or capital on reasonable terms or at any terms. Our ability to finance our development and redevelopment projects and pending or new acquisitions, as well as our ability to refinance debt maturities, could be adversely affected by our inability to secure capital on reasonable terms, if at all. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - We May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our Business Objectives and - We May Not Be Able to Refinance Our Debt. The current economic, financial and banking environment, worldwide economic recession and lack of consumer confidence have improved since the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. Even with the recent improvements, we remain cautious over the economic, financial and banking environment. We intend to continue to focus on the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately 575,152 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects aggregating approximately an additional 980,000 rentable square feet. Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up/vertical above ground development in order to preserve and create value for these projects. These important preconstruction activities add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings. We also intend to be very careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up/vertical developments. Future ground-up/vertical development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high quality and/or credit entities. We also intend to continue to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital structure over a multi-year period. During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt maturities. We expect the source of funds for construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be provided over several years by cash flows from operations, opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures, new secured or unsecured debt and the issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2009, we had identified three assets as held for sale, that have been classified in discontinued operations. 43 As further discussed below, our principal liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring expenses; current development and redevelopment costs; capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; principal and interest payments due under our debt obligations, including balloon payments of principal; and dividend distributions in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that our sources of capital for our principal liquidity needs will be satisfied by: cash on hand of approximately $70.6 million as of December 31, 2009; restricted cash of approximately $24.1 million as of December 31, 2009 to fund certain construction costs; cash flows generated by operating activities (for the year ended December 31, 2009, we generated approximately $206.0 million of cash flows from operating activities); availability under our $1.9 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (approximately $1.2 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2009); cash proceeds from new secured or unsecured financings; cash proceeds generated from potential asset sales including three properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2009; cash proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred equity or debt securities; and cash proceeds from joint ventures. Principal liquidity needs Contractual obligations and commitments Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 consisted of the following (in thousands): Payments by Period Total 2010 2011-2012 2013-2014 Thereafter Secured notes payable (1) $ 937,017 $ 35,982 $ 176,191 $ 308,096 $ 416,748 Unsecured line of credit (2) 476,000 476,000 Unsecured term loan (2) 750,000 750,000 Unsecured convertible notes 624,700 384,700 240,000 Estimated interest payments 598,252 120,955 193,638 113,605 170,054 Ground lease obligations 611,440 6,558 15,831 17,079 571,972 Other obligations 3,288 1,357 1,931 Total $ 4,000,697 $ 164,852 $ 1,998,291 $ 678,780 $ 1,158,774 (1) Assumes we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity dates of a secured note payable of approximately $28.5 million from January 1, 2011 to January 1, 2012, and a secured note payable of approximately $38.4 million from January 2, 2012 to April 6, 2013. Amounts include noncontrolling interests share of scheduled principal maturities of approximately $39.3 million, of which approximately $17.6 million and $20.8 million mature in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Also, amounts are net of unamortized discounts of approximately $2.1 million. (2) Assumes we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date of our unsecured line of credit from October 2010 to October 2011 and our unsecured term loan from October 2011 to October 2012. Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2009 consisted of 26 notes secured by 57 properties and one land development parcel. Our secured notes payable require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.83% at December 31, 2009. Noncontrolling interests share of secured notes payable aggregated approximately $39.3 million as of December 31, 2009. The total book values of rental properties, net, land held for future development and construction in progress securing debt were approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, our secured notes payable were comprised of approximately $831.5 million and $105.5 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively. 44 Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2011. Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2012. In April 2009, we completed a private offering of $240 million principal amount of 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. In January 2007, we completed a private offering of $460 million principal amount of 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes. In April 2009, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, approximately $75 million (par value) of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes. See additional information under Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K regarding our ability to redeem the notes, the ability of the holders to require us to repurchase the notes and circumstances under which the holders may convert the notes. Estimated interest payments on our fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 83% of our debt was fixed rate debt or variable rate debt subject to interest rate hedge agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate hedge agreements under Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Hedge Agreements. The remaining 17% of our debt is unhedged variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable rate debt have been excluded from the table on the prior page because we cannot reasonably determine the future interest obligations on variable rate debt as we cannot predict the applicable variable interest rates in the future. See additional information regarding our debt under Notes 5, 6, 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2009 included leases for 19 of our properties and three land development parcels. These lease obligations have remaining lease terms from 23 to 97 years, excluding extension options. In addition to the above, as of December 31, 2009, remaining aggregate costs under contracts for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment and generic office/laboratory infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated $186.8 million. We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We are also committed to fund approximately $48.3 million for certain investments over the next six years. Capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs As of December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate of approximately 980,000 rentable square feet undergoing vertical ground-up construction and an aggregate of approximately 575,152 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to office/laboratory space through redevelopment including the conversion of single tenancy space to multi-tenancy spaces or multi-tenancy spaces to single tenancy space. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements related to our properties, including expenditures related to our development and redevelopment projects, aggregating approximately $446.1 million, $542.5 million and $589.7 million, respectively. These amounts include payments for property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements presented in the table below including non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures and tenant improvement and leasing costs related to re-tenanted and renewal space. We expect our future property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements related to our life science properties to decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009. 45 The following table shows total and the five-year average per square foot property-related capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Five-Year Year Ended December 31, Average 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Capital expenditures (1): Major capital expenditures $ 772,000 $ 529,000 $ 405,000 $ 1,379,000 $ 575,000 $ 972,000 Recurring capital expenditures $ 985,000 $ 1,405,000 $ 955,000 $ 648,000 $ 639,000 $ 1,278,000 Square feet in portfolio 10,581,399 11,740,993 11,770,769 11,476,217 9,790,326 8,128,690 Per square foot: Major capital expenditures $ 0.07 $ 0.05 $ 0.03 $ 0.12 $ 0.06 $ 0.12 Recurring capital expenditures $ 0.09 $ 0.12 $ 0.08 $ 0.06 $ 0.07 $ 0.16 Tenant improvements and leasing costs: Re-tenanted space (2) Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 1,619,000 $ 1,475,000 $ 3,481,000 $ 1,446,000 $ 1,370,000 $ 324,000 Re-tenanted square feet 264,382 211,638 505,773 224,767 248,846 130,887 Per square foot $ 6.12 $ 6.97 $ 6.88 $ 6.43 $ 5.51 $ 2.48 Renewal space Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 1,861,000 $ 3,263,000 $ 2,364,000 $ 1,942,000 $ 957,000 $ 778,000 Renewal square feet 703,645 976,546 748,512 671,127 455,980 666,058 Per square foot $ 2.64 $ 3.34 $ 3.16 $ 2.89 $ 2.10 $ 1.17 (1) Property-related capital expenditures include all major capital and recurring capital expenditures except capital expenditures that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing capital expenditures or costs related to the redevelopment of a property. Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a property is acquired. (2) Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before re-tenanting. Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants. As of December 31, 2009 approximately 91% (on a rentable square footage basis) of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing). In addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures. Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age, location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or re-tenanted space) the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions. We expect our future capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) to be approximately in the range as shown in the table immediately above. 46 Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan We use our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, construction activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our $1.9 billion unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion in unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $500 million. As of December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of $476 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 4.10%. Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus 1.00% to 1.45% depending on our leverage or (2) the higher of a rate based upon Bank of America prime rate plus 0.0% to 0.25% depending on our leverage and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. Our unsecured line of credit matures in October 2010 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2011. Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2011 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period to October 2012. Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among others, the following (as defined under the terms of the agreement): leverage ratio less than 65.0%; fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.40; minimum book value of $1.6 billion; and secured debt ratio less than 55.0%. As of December 31, 2009, we believe our two most restrictive financial covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan are the leverage and fixed charge ratios. Future changes in interest rates, our outstanding debt balances and other changes in our business, operations or financial statements may result in a default of these and other financial covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions, mergers, developments, land and borrowings available under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan for developments, land and encumbered assets. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Management continuously monitors the Company compliance and projected compliance with the covenants. Our current expectation is that we will continue to meet requirements of our debt covenants in the short and long term. However, in the event of a continued economic slow-down, continued crisis in the credit markets and rising cost of capital, there is no certainty that we will be able to continue to satisfy all of the covenant requirements. Aggregate unsecured borrowings may be limited to an amount based primarily on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties and our cost basis of development assets and land. Aggregate unsecured borrowings may increase as we complete the development, redevelopment, or acquisition of additional unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2009, aggregate unsecured borrowings were limited to approximately $2.8 billion. If net operating income from properties supporting our borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facilities decreases, our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will also decrease. Additionally, we may be required to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in order to maintain compliance with one or more covenants under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 49 lenders providing commitments under our $1.9 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. During 2009, all lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan funded all borrowings requested under these agreements. In the future, if one or more such lenders fail to fund a borrowing request, we may not be able to borrow funds necessary for working capital, construction activities, dividend payments, debt repayment and monthly debt service and other recurring capital requirements. The failure of one or more lenders to fund their share of a borrowing request may have a material impact on our financial statements. We have risks associated with the maturity of our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. There may be fewer, if any, lenders willing to participate in future unsecured credit facilities and future commitments from lenders may be lower than existing commitments. In addition, key terms and covenants may be less favorable than existing key terms and covenants and we may not be able to raise capital to repay our outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facilities prior to or at maturity. 47 Interest rate hedge agreements We utilize interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap and cap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the notional amount ). Interest received under all of our interest rate hedge agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Transaction Dates Effective Dates Termination Dates Interest Pay Rates Notional Amounts Effective at December 31, 2009 Fair Values December 2006 December 29, 2006 March 31, 2014 4.990% $ 50,000 $ 50,000 $ (4,948 ) December 2006 January 2, 2007 January 3, 2011 5.003 28,500 28,500 (1,389 ) October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2012 4.546 50,000 50,000 (3,733 ) October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2013 4.642 50,000 50,000 (4,195 ) December 2005 January 2, 2008 December 31, 2010 4.768 50,000 50,000 (2,103 ) June 2006 June 30, 2008 June 30, 2010 5.325 50,000 50,000 (1,255 ) June 2006 June 30, 2008 June 30, 2010 5.325 50,000 50,000 (1,255 ) October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.622 25,000 25,000 (2,018 ) October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.625 25,000 25,000 (2,020 ) October 2008 October 16, 2008 January 31, 2010 2.755 100,000 100,000 (203 ) June 2006 October 31, 2008 December 31, 2010 5.340 50,000 50,000 (2,391 ) June 2006 October 31, 2008 December 31, 2010 5.347 50,000 50,000 (2,395 ) October 2008 September 30, 2009 January 31, 2011 3.119 100,000 100,000 (2,693 ) December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.015 75,000 75,000 (7,496 ) December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.023 75,000 75,000 (7,493 ) December 2006 December 31, 2010 October 31, 2012 5.015 100,000 (4,359 ) Total $ 828,500 $ (49,946 ) We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between the Company and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate hedge agreements. In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate hedge agreements, our interest rate hedge agreements are spread among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2009 , the largest aggregate notional amount with an individual counterparty was $175 million. If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. As of December 31 , 2009, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits based upon their respective fair values aggregating a liability balance of approximately $49.9 million with the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in total equity. Balances in accumulated other comprehensive loss are recognized in earnings in the period that the forecasted hedge transactions affect earnings. Also, during the year ended December 31 , 2009, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount approximating $38.4 million effective May 15, 2009 and terminating on January 3, 2012. This agreement sets a ceiling on one-month LIBOR at 2.50% related to one secured note. The interest rate cap agreement was classified in other assets based upon its fair value aggregating an asset balance of approximately $189,000. We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate hedge agreements. For the year ended December 31 , 2009, approximately $37.5 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. During the next twelve months, we expect to reclassify approximately $28.6 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. 48 Secured notes payable As of December 31, 2009, we had aggregate secured notes payable of approximately $937.0 million. If we are unable to refinance, extend principal payments due at maturity or pay principal maturities with proceeds from other capital sources, then our cash flows may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, even if we are able to refinance debt prior to maturity, the interest rate, loan to value and other key loan terms may be less favorable than existing loan terms. Less favorable loan terms, assuming we are able to refinance our secured notes payable, may result in higher interest costs, additional required capital as a result of less proceeds or lower loan to value upon refinancing and new or more restrictive covenants or loan terms. Dividends We are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors. We may be required to use borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid dividends on our common stock aggregating approximately $86.7 million. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock aggregating approximately $10.9 million and $17.5 million, respectively. Sources of capital Cash and cash equivalents As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $70.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. Tenant security deposits and other restricted cash Tenant security deposits and other restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2009 2008 Funds held in trust under the terms of certain secured notes payable $ 19,340 $ 16,118 Funds held in escrow related to construction projects 24,054 49,499 Other restricted funds 3,897 2,165 Total $ 47,291 $ 67,782 The funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for certain construction costs. Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $49.9 million to $206.0 million compared to $255.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in cash flows from overall changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in net income. Cash flows from operations are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent and operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs. We believe our cash flows from operating activities provide a stable source of cash to fund operating expenses. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto, and approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. We are largely dependent on the life science industry for revenues due under lease agreements. Our business could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by the current economic downturn and financial and banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the United States to other countries. Our tenants may not be able to pay amounts due under their lease agreements if they are unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making or selling their products or technologies. 49 The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, the bankruptcy court must approve any eviction. The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $409.9 million compared to $494.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities reflects lower proceeds from dispositions as well as lower additions to properties due to our strategy to reduce capital spending in 2009 as compared to 2008. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31 , 2009 decreased by $98.8 million to $203.4 million compared to $302.2 million for the year ended December 31 , 2008. For the year ended December 31 , 2009, proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion from the issuance of common stock, the issuance of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes and borrowings from secured notes payable and our unsecured line of credit were partially offset by approximately $1.2 billion related to the repurchase of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes, principal reductions related to repayments of outstanding principal on our secured notes payable and repayments of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit. Additionally, for the year ended December 31 , 2009, we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately $115.0 million. For the year ended December 31 , 2008, proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion from the issuance of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and borrowings from secured notes payable and our unsecured line of credit were partially offset by principal repayments of approximately $0.9 billion related to outstanding amounts an our second notes payable and unsecured line of credit. Additionally, we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately $122.0 million during the year ended December 31 , 2008. Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan We use our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, construction activities and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Our $1.9 billion unsecured credit facilities consist of a $1.15 billion unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $500 million. As of December 31, 2009, we had borrowings of $476 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 4.10%. See additional information regarding our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan on page 47. Property dispositions During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold four properties at an aggregate contract price of approximately $20.9 million. The net sales proceeds were initially used to repay outstanding secured debt related to the properties sold or outstanding debt on our unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2009, we had three properties classified as held for sale. Other resources and liquidity requirements Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions. In September 2009, we sold 4,600,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including shares issued upon full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) . The shares were issued at a price of $53.25 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $233.5 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). In April 2009, we completed a private offering of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. The net proceeds from this offering, after initial purchasers fees and other offering costs, were approximately $233.0 million. Prior to April 20, 2014, we will not have the right to redeem the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a REIT. On and after that date, we have the right to redeem the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase their notes, in whole or in part, on April 15, 2014, 2019 and 2024 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 50 Holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. At issuance, the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of approximately 24.1546 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, representing a conversion price of approximately $41.40 per share of our common stock. This initial conversion price represented a premium of 15% based on the last reported sale price of $36.00 per share of our common stock on April 21, 2009. The conversion rate of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain cash dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.35 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, there was no change from the initial conversion rate of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. Holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes may convert their notes prior to the stated maturity date of April 15, 2029 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2009, if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds or is equal to 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement Period ) in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes during the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Note Measurement Period; (3) upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change; (4) if we call the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, March 15, 2029 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 15, 2029 or earlier redemption or repurchase. Upon conversion, holders of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes will receive cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, as the case may be, at our election. Pursuant to the accounting literature related to convertible debt, at issuance of the 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, we determined the effective interest rate of the notes to be 11.0%. In March 2009, we sold 7,000,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering . The shares were issued at a price of $38.25 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $254.6 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). In March and April 2008, we completed a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $242 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). The proceeds from this offering were used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit. The dividends on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance. We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $1.75 per share. Our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions, and we are not allowed to redeem our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, except to preserve our status as a REIT. Investors in our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights. On or after April 20, 2013, we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted if the closing sale price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to our issuance of a press release announcing the exercise of our conversion option. Holders of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their outstanding shares initially at a conversion rate of 0.2477 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $100.93 per share of common stock. The conversion rate for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock had a conversion rate of approximately 0.2480 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $100.81 per share of common stock. In January 2007, we completed a private offering of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes. The net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters discount, were approximately $450.8 million. Prior to January 15, 2012, we will not have the right to redeem the Notes, except to preserve our qualification as a REIT. On and after that date, we have the right to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes, in whole or in part, on January 15, 2012, 2017 and 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date. Holders of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the 51 occurrence of a Fundamental Change, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. At issuance, the Notes had an initial conversion rate of approximately 8.4774 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes representing a conversion price of approximately $117.96 per share of our common stock. This initial conversion price represented a premium of 20% based on the last reported sale price of $98.30 per share of our common stock on January 10, 2007. The conversion rate of the Notes is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.74 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, the Notes had a conversion rate of approximately 8.5207 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $117.36 per share of our common stock. Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock prior to the stated maturity of the Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) the Notes will be convertible during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2007, if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) the Notes will be convertible during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the Note Measurement Period ) in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value of the Notes during the Note Measurement Period; (3) the Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, including a change in control, certain merger or consolidation transactions or the liquidation of the Company; (4) the Notes will be convertible if we call the Notes for redemption; and (5) the Notes will be convertible at any time from, and including, December 15, 2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15, 2027 or earlier redemption or repurchase. The Note Measurement Period is the five consecutive trading day period following a request by a holder of the Notes to convert his Notes. Pursuant to the accounting literature related to convertible debt, at issuance of the 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes, we determined the effective interest rate of the notes to be 5.96%. We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in limited liability companies which we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing related activities. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2009, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Exposure to environmental liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. Inflation As of December 31, 2009, approximately 88% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. In addition, approximately 8% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. 52 Funds from operations GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the White Paper ) and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows above for information regarding these measures of cash flow). The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO, to FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders $ 104,974 $ 90,746 Add: Depreciation and amortization (1) 118,508 108,743 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 7,047 3,799 Net income attributable to unvested restricted stock awards 1,270 1,327 Subtract: Gain on sales of property (2) (2,627 ) (20,401 ) FFO attributable to noncontrolling interests (3,843 ) (4,108 ) FFO attributable to unvested restricted stock awards (2,694 ) (2,596 ) Subtotal $ 222,635 $ 177,510 Add: Assumed conversion of 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes 11,943 Effect of dilutive securities and assumed conversion attributable to unvested restricted stock 118 9 FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders assuming effect of dilutive securities and assumed conversion $ 234,696 $ 177,519 (1) Includes depreciation and amortization on assets held for sale reflected as discontinued operations for the periods prior to when such assets were classified as held for sale.
