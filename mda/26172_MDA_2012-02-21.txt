ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights 2012 Outlook Results of Operations Restructuring and Other Charges Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 32 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc, Chrysler Group, LLC, Daimler Trucks North America, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, Ford Motor Company, Komatsu, Volvo AB and Case New Holland. We serve our customers through a network of more than 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers' access to credit. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, Russia and countries in the Middle East. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. In 2011, certain North American markets experienced robust recoveries, especially the North American on-highway markets which was enhanced by the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emission change. Demand for heavy-duty on-highway products in North America was three times higher in 2011 compared to 2010 and medium-duty truck and bus shipments in North America were two times higher. North American oil and gas markets and global mining markets also continued to experience strong growth in 2011. Emerging markets continued to experience strong growth in 2011, especially in the international construction markets. Emerging market growth was particularly strong in China, India and Brazil, although the growth rates began to soften in the second half of the year, especially in the on-highway truck and off-highway construction markets in China and power generation markets in India. Growth rates are slowing in certain emerging markets like China and India as governments look to control inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit. Currently, inflation concerns appear to be declining in China and there is a growing expectation that the government will start to ease monetary policy, which would enhance our end markets. Inflation concerns in India also appear to be 33 Table of Contents declining. The European economy remains an uncertainty as we enter 2012, with continued volatility in the Euro countries. Although we do not have any significant direct exposure to European sovereign debt, we do generate approximately nine percent of our net sales from Euro zone countries. Therefore, continued economic decline in Europe could have an adverse impact on our financial results. The following table contains sales and EBIT results by operating segment for the years ended 2011 and 2010. Refer to the section titled "Operating Segment Results" for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before taxes. Operating Segments 2011 2010 Percent change 2011 vs. 2010 Percent of Total Percent of Total In millions Sales EBIT Sales EBIT Sales EBIT Engine $ 11,307 63 % $ 1,384 $ 7,888 60 % $ 809 43 % 71 % Components 4,063 23 % 470 3,046 23 % 278 33 % 69 % Power Generation 3,498 19 % 373 2,919 22 % 299 20 % 25 % Distribution 3,044 17 % 386 2,324 18 % 297 31 % 30 % Intersegment eliminations (3,864 ) (22 )% (2,951 ) (23 )% 31 % Non segment 102 (26 ) NM Total $ 18,048 100 % $ 2,715 $ 13,226 100 % $ 1,657 36 % 64 % Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. for 2011 was $1,848 million, or $9.55 per diluted share, on sales of $18.0 billion, compared to 2010 net income attributable to Cummins Inc. of $1,040 million, or $5.28 per diluted share, on sales of $13.2 billion. The increase in income was driven by higher volumes in most markets and geographic regions, including the recovery of the North American on-highway truck markets, stronger demand in certain emerging markets, significantly improved gross margins, the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business, a lower effective tax rate, increased equity income and the gain related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. These were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 also benefited $0.17 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. In 2011, we recorded a gain on the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business of $68 million ($37 million after-tax or $0.19 per diluted share) and a gain on the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business of $53 million ($33 million after-tax or $0.17 per diluted share). For a detailed discussion of the divestitures, see Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Also in 2011, we recorded a gain related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement for a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana of $38 million ($24 million after-tax or $0.13 per diluted share). For a detailed discussion of the gain, see Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The gains have been excluded from segment results as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. In 2010, we recorded a recovery of $32 million ($21 million after-tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) related to the overpayment of revenue based taxes on imported products in Brazil from 2004-2008. The tax recovery was recorded in cost of sales in our non segment business results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. We generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flows in 2011, compared to $1.0 billion in 2010. Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. 34 Table of Contents In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock which was completed in the first quarter of 2011. In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of Cummins common stock upon the completion of the $500 million program. We repurchased $629 million in 2011, $ 111 million of which was under the repurchase program that was originally authorized in 2007 and $ 518 million of which was under the repurchase program that was authorized in 2011. In July 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 52 percent to $0.40 per share on a quarterly basis effective in the third quarter. Our debt to capital ratio (capital is defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2011, was 11.8 percent, compared to 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had a Baa1 credit rating with a positive outlook from Moody's Investors Service, Inc., an A credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor's Rating Services and an A- credit rating and a positive outlook from Fitch Ratings. In addition to our $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have sufficient access to our revolving credit facility with $1.2 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit and our accounts receivable program with $209 million available, based on eligible reserves, to meet currently anticipated growth and funding needs. Our global pension plans, including our unfunded non-qualified plans, were 98 percent funded at year-end 2011. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents approximately 60 percent of our worldwide pension obligation, was 103 percent funded and the international plans were 106 percent funded. Asset returns in 2011 for the U.S. qualified plan were 13 percent while the year-end 2011 discount rate was 4.8 percent, down 0.6 percentage points from the 2010 discount rate of 5.4 percent. We expect to contribute $130 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2012. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2012. We expect pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2012 to increase by approximately $4 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, when compared to 2011. Refer to application of critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements , for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 2012 OUTLOOK Near-Term: In 2011, North America experienced a robust recovery in demand in heavy-, medium- and light-duty on-highway truck markets. Economies in emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil, experienced strong growth although demand began to soften in the second half of the year, especially in on-highway truck and off-highway construction markets in China and power generation markets in India. We currently expect the following positive trends in 2012: The North American on-highway truck markets are expected to remain strong. Global oil and gas and mining markets are expected to remain strong. India's power generation markets are expected to improve and truck orders are expected to remain strong. Brazil is expected to continue experiencing growth in the power generation business and is anticipating growth in the aftertreatment business as the result of the 2012 emissions change. Components sales in Brazil are expected to increase following the implementation of Euro V emission regulations. 35 Table of Contents We currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in 2012: In China and India, demand in certain industrial markets could remain low in the first half of 2012, although improvements are expected in the second half of the year. Our engine sales in Brazil in 2012 could be negatively impacted by pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the implementation of Euro V emission regulations, as well as one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with their own proprietary engine. Demand in certain European markets could decline in 2012. We will increase our investment in new product development. Currency volatility could put pressure on earnings in 2012. Long-Term: We believe that, over the longer term, there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future.

The primary drivers for the increase in sales were: Engine segment sales increased by 43 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by heavy-duty truck, industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses. Components segment sales increased by 33 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission solutions and turbo technologies businesses. Power Generation segment sales increased by 20 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by commercial products and generator technologies businesses and improved price realization. Distribution segment sales increased by 31 percent due to increased demand in all product lines and all geographic regions led by Asia Pacific, North and Central America, Europe and Middle East regions. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets were 59 percent of total net sales in 2011, compared with 64 percent of total net sales in 2010. Gross Margin Gross margin increased by $ 1,421 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 1.4 percentage points. The significant improvement was led by increases in volume, improved price realization, higher product content on certain products and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher material costs, higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of EPA 2010 products. Gross margin in 2010 also benefited from a one-time $32 million tax recovery in Brazil. See Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales in 2011 was 2.1 percent compared to 3.0 percent in 2010. Accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than the rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 products have been lower than expected. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $174 million in compensation and related expenses including increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, merit increases and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $42 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 11.2 percent in 2010 to 10.2 percent in 2011. 37 Table of Contents Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $79 million in compensation and related expenses, an increase in the number of engineering programs with increased costs of $79 million and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $8 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 3.5 percent in 2011 from 3.1 percent in 2010. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased primarily due to the following: In millions 2011 vs. 2010 Increase/(Decrease) North American distributors $ 33 Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. 22 Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. 9 Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (19 ) Other 9 Royalty and interest income 11 These overall increases were primarily due to the economic recovery in North America, particularly in the oil and gas markets, and strong demand for power generation and mining products in China with CCEC, which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway truck market. Gain on Sale of Businesses In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was $123 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $62 million, $171 million and $126 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating results for this business were approximately $9 million, $22 million and $11 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $64 million, $74 million and $54 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating results for this business were approximately $13 million, $9 million and $2 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. 38 Table of Contents We have entered into supply and other agreements with the operations that represent ongoing involvement and as such, the results of these operations have not been presented as discontinued operations. Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Flood damage gain (loss) $ 38 $ (2 ) Royalty income 12 10 Royalty expense (3 ) (3 ) Amortization of intangible assets (5 ) (15 ) Legal settlement (5 ) Gain (loss) on sale of fixed assets (10 ) (4 ) Other, net (6 ) (2 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ 21 $ (16 ) In June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40 million from our insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining flood related expenses, in "Other operating (expense) income, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Income . Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in addition to higher average interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense increased primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2011 and higher average debt, partially offset by lower interest rates. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense) was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance $ 12 $ 12 Dividend income 7 7 Gain on fair value adjustment for Cummins Western Canada 12 Life insurance proceeds 7 Foreign currency gains (losses), net (14 ) (1 ) Bank charges (16 ) (15 ) Other, net 11 12 Total other income (expense), net $ $ 34 39 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.1 percent compared to 29.5 percent for 2010. Our 2011 income tax provision includes a discrete tax benefit of $48 million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related tax reserves. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a tax benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a discrete tax benefit of $16 million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with taxing authorities. The 2011 income tax provision also includes other discrete tax items totaling to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and the U.K. as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings. Our 2010 income tax provision includes a $17 million reduction in the fourth quarter related to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit as well as a $3 million discrete tax benefit related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. We expect our 2012 effective tax rate to be 29 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. The research tax credit expired December 31, 2011, and has not yet been renewed by Congress. If the research credit is reinstated, we would anticipate the 2012 effective tax rate to be 28 percent. Earnings of our China operations will be considered to be permanently reinvested beginning in 2012 and additional U.S. deferred tax will no longer be provided on future earnings. We have $693 million of retained earnings and related cumulative translation adjustments in our China operations as of December 31, 2011 and have provided a U.S. deferred tax liability of $172 million related to these earnings that will be distributed to the U.S. in the future as well as the related translation impacts as of December 31, 2011. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $9 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd. and $4 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on various exchanges in India. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6 million at Cummins Western Canada LP, $4 million at Cummins Power Systems LLC and $1 million at Cummins Northeast LLC. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in most markets and geographic regions, including the recovery of the North American on-highway truck markets, significantly improved gross margins, the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, a lower effective tax rate, increased equity income and the gain related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 also benefited $0.17 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. 40 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from the recovery of emerging markets and improvement in developed markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were: Engine segment sales increased by 23 percent due to increased demand in most lines of business, led by increased demand in international industrial sales, stationary power engine sales, North American light-duty automotive sales and international medium-duty truck sales. Components segment sales increased by 29 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission solutions, turbo technologies and filtration businesses. Power Generation segment sales increased by 21 percent due to increased sales in most lines of business led by commercial products. Distribution segment sales increased by 30 percent primarily due to the acquisition of the majority interest in an equity investee and increased sales in all geographic regions. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets were 64 percent of total net sales in 2010, compared with 52 percent of total net sales in 2009. Gross Margin Gross margin increased by $999 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 3.9 percentage points. The significant improvement was led by higher volumes, decreases in warranty expense, increased pricing and favorable material costs. The warranty provision on sales issued in 2010 as a percentage of sales was 3.0 percent compared to 3.3 percent in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to engine mix. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. In the third quarter of 2010, it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax on imported products during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a pre-tax recovery of $32 million in cost of sales ($21 million after-tax) related to tax credits arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes in support of the business and an increase of $151 million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010 performance increased $93 million over variable compensation related to 2009 performance. Salaries and fringe benefits increased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009 that were partially offset by increased employment in 2010. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 11.2 percent in 2010 from 11.5 percent in 2009. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $35 million in compensation and related expenses and a decrease of $24 million in reimbursements. 41 Table of Contents Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010 performance increased $20 million over variable compensation related to 2009 performance. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased slightly to 3.1 percent in 2010 from 3.4 percent in 2009. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased primarily due to the following: In millions 2010 vs. 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. $ 66 Komatsu manufacturing alliances 13 Royalty and interest income 12 These overall increases were primarily due to higher demand as a result of economic recovery in emerging markets. Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Amortization of intangible assets $ (15 ) $ (7 ) Loss on sale of fixed assets (4 ) (8 ) Royalty expense (3 ) (7 ) Flood damage (loss) gain(1) (2 ) 12 Royalty income 10 8 Other, net (2 ) 1 Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (16 ) $ (1 ) (1) In 2009, the flood gain represents flood insurance proceeds received which more than offset flood related expenses recognized in 2009 and 2008. Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher investment balances in 2010 compared to 2009. Interest Expense Interest expense increased primarily due to higher borrowings in 2010 compared to 2009. 42 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense) was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(1) $ 12 $ (4 ) Gain on fair value adjustment for Cummins Western Canada 12 Dividend income 7 5 Life insurance proceeds 7 Foreign currency losses, net(2) (1 ) (20 ) Bank charges (15 ) (14 ) Other, net 12 18 Total other income (expense), net $ 34 $ (15 ) (1) The change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance for the year ended December 31, 2010, was due to improved market performance. The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance for the year ended December 31, 2009, was due to market deterioration. (2) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations; primarily in the British Pound and Brazilian Real. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 29.5 percent compared to 24.4 percent for 2009. Our 2010 income tax provision also includes a $17 million (1.1 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. During 2010, we also released $3 million (0.2 percent) of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a $29 million (4.5 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. In 2009, we released $19 million of deferred tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of $10 million related to prior period matters. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased primarily due to an increase of $18 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on various exchanges in India and a $15 million increase from Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd., reflecting the economic recovery in emerging markets. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in emerging markets and certain developed countries, significantly improved gross margins, increased equity income and restructuring charges incurred in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. These were partially offset by higher income tax expense, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Diluted earnings per share also benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. 43 Table of Contents RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES 2009 Restructuring Actions In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee actions at many of our manufacturing locations, including approximately 3,200 hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring costs were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. In response to closures and downsizing noted above, we incurred $2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5 million of restructuring expenses for asset impairments. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85 million, comprising $90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the $3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2 million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in "Restructuring and other charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Income . These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December 31, 2009 Workforce reductions $ 81 Exit activities 7 Other 2 Changes in estimate (5 ) Total restructuring charges 85 Curtailment loss 14 Total restructuring and other charges $ 99 In addition, as a result of the restructuring actions described above, we also recorded a $14 million curtailment loss in our pension and other postretirement plans. See Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. At December 31, 2010, of the approximately 4,200 employees affected by this plan, substantially all terminations were complete. We do not include restructuring charges in our operating segment results.

This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, restructuring and other charges, flood damage gains or losses, or income taxes to individual segments. In 2011 non-segment items included the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business while 2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated to the businesses as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. 45 Table of Contents Following is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments.

The following are the primary drivers by market: Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to recovery in North American on-highway markets as OEM customers replace their aging fleets and the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emission standard changes. Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 26 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure improvements in certain emerging markets, increased demand in advance of off-highway emission regulations in the U.S. and Europe, a 46 percent increase in units sold in the global mining engine markets due to increased coal and commodity demands and more than double the number of oil and gas engine shipments in North America. Medium-duty truck and bus sales increased primarily due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets, the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emissions change and higher demand in the Brazilian truck engine market driven by a growing economy. Total on-highway-related sales for 2011 were 56 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 50 percent in 2010. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2010, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 864 55 % 1.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses (142 ) (22 )% 1.2 Research, development and engineering expenses (134 ) (51 )% (0.2 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 5 3 % (0.5 ) The increase in gross margin versus 2010, was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization and favorable mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of EPA 2010 products. Although our warranty costs increased, our warranty cost as a percentage of sales decreased as actual accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 engines have been lower than expected. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to strong demand for power generation and mining products in China with CCEC and strong export sales to Russia and Brazil in the midrange on-highway market with Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway heavy-duty and medium-duty truck market in China. 47 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Sales Engine segment sales increased versus 2009, due to improved sales in most markets, especially the industrial, stationary power, light-duty automotive and medium-duty truck markets, which were partially offset by decreases in the North American heavy-duty truck market. The following are the primary drivers by market. Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 154 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure investment in emerging markets and a 123 percent improvement in units sold in the international mining markets due to increased coal and commodity demands. Stationary power engine sales increased primarily due to higher demand in power generation markets, particularly for high-horse power engines. Light-duty automotive sales increased significantly due to a 77 percent improvement in units sold to Chrysler as the result of shut-downs in 2009 as part of its reorganization efforts. Medium-duty truck engine sales increased due to a 78 percent increase in international units sold, primarily due to higher demand in the Brazilian truck market driven by a growing economy and government incentives. These increases were partially offset by a decline in heavy-duty truck engine sales. Consistent with prior emission standards changes, North American (includes the U.S and Canada and excludes Mexico) unit sales declined 61 percent due to higher engine purchases by OEMs in late 2009, ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)'s 2010 emission standards change, as part of the OEM's transition plan. Total on-highway-related sales for 2010 were 50 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 61 percent in 2009. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2009, primarily due to higher gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 539 53 % 3.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses (88 ) (16 )% 0.5 Research, development and engineering expenses (22 ) (9 )% 0.5 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 107 NM 1.2 The increase in gross margin versus 2009, was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization, decreased warranty expense and cost structure improvements from actions taken in late 2008 and early 2009, partially offset by an unfavorable mix. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation which resulted from the segment's strong performance. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased in most 48 Table of Contents unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase was led by higher demand in emerging markets, especially at DCEC and Komatsu-Cummins Engine Company (KCEC).

The following are the primary regional drivers by business: Emission solutions business sales increased due to the increased sales volume of North American EPA 2010 aftertreatment systems and increased demand for Euro V aftertreatment systems in Europe, which were partially offset by lower sales due to the sale of the exhaust business. Turbo technologies business sales increased due to higher OEM demand in North America, Europe, India and Brazil and improved aftermarket demand. Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved demand in North American on-highway markets. 49 Table of Contents Filtration business sales increased due to improved aftermarket demand, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe, higher OEM demand due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets and favorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust and light-duty filtration businesses. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 295 51 % 2.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses (44 ) (19 )% 0.8 Research, development and engineering expenses (61 ) (54 )% (0.6 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 8 35 % The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes for all businesses and increased product content on 2010 North American truck engines. The increases in research, development and engineering expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was driven by improved joint venture income from both the filtration business in China and India and the fuel systems business. In 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and recognized $68 million and $53 million, respectively, in pre-tax gain on the sales. The gains have been excluded from Components results as they were not considered in our evaluation of Components operating results for the year ended 2011. See Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2010 vs. 2009 Sales Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2009. The following are the primary regional drivers by business. Emission solutions business sales increased due to higher technology content and increased sales of North American EPA 2010 aftertreatment systems and higher European demand for aftertreatment systems for the first fit market, which were partially offset by decreased sales of our EPA 2007 aftertreatment systems. Turbo technologies business sales increased due to improved original equipment demand in Europe and China and significant global aftermarket recovery. Filtration business sales increased in all regions primarily due to global aftermarket recovery and improved global original equipment sales. 50 Table of Contents Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved OEM first fit sales in China and the aftermarket recovery in North America, which was partially offset by decreased first fit sales in North America. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT almost tripled versus 2009, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses.

Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased due to higher demand, especially at Cummins Olayan Energy and CCEC. 53 Table of Contents Distribution Segment Results Financial data for the Distribution segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 In millions 2011 2010 2009 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 3,021 $ 2,311 $ 1,777 $ 710 31 % $ 534 30 % Intersegment sales 23 13 7 10 77 % 6 86 % Total sales 3,044 2,324 1,784 720 31 % 540 30 % Depreciation and amortization 25 25 17 (8 ) (47 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 172 132 125 40 30 % 7 6 % Interest income 3 2 1 1 50 % 1 100 % Segment EBIT 386 297 235 89 30 % 62 26 % Percentage Points Percentage Points Segment EBIT as a percentage of total sales 12.7 % 12.8 % 13.2 % (0.1 ) (0.4 ) Sales for our Distribution segment by region were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 In millions 2011 2010 2009 Amount Percent Amount Percent Asia Pacific $ 1,170 $ 904 $ 755 $ 266 29 % $ 149 20 % Europe and Middle East 808 683 598 125 18 % 85 14 % North and Central America 797 539 278 258 48 % 261 94 % Africa 151 111 94 40 36 % 17 18 % South America 118 87 59 31 36 % 28 47 % Total sales $ 3,044 $ 2,324 $ 1,784 $ 720 31 % $ 540 30 % Sales for our Distribution segment by product were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 In millions 2011 2010 2009 Amount Percent Amount Percent Parts and filtration $ 1,085 $ 882 $ 665 $ 203 23 % $ 217 33 % Power generation 722 516 457 206 40 % 59 13 % Engines 703 466 324 237 51 % 142 44 % Service 534 460 338 74 16 % 122 36 % Total sales $ 3,044 $ 2,324 $ 1,784 $ 720 31 % $ 540 30 % 54 Table of Contents 2011 vs. 2010 Sales Distribution segment sales increased for all product lines versus 2010. The following were the primary drivers by line of business: Engine product sales increased primarily due to growth in the oil and gas markets in North and Central America, improved demand in certain markets in Europe, partially driven by pre-buy activity ahead of the 2012 emissions change, and higher demand in Africa. Power generation product sales increased primarily due to improved project-based business across North and Central America, South Pacific, Middle East and Europe, increased demand from Japan's earthquake recovery and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010. Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America, the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010, higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific, improved sales in East Asia as the result of overall market recovery and increasing engine populations and higher demand driven by economic recovery in Europe. Foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted sales. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to improved gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees, which was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBIT was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a one-time gain of $12 million from the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 161 31 % 0.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses (108 ) (30 )% 0.1 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 40 30 % The increase in gross margin versus 2010, was primarily due to higher volumes in most products, favorable foreign currency impacts and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to higher headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher income from North American distributors, especially in the oil and gas markets, and increased parts sales. 55 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Excluding Acquisitions Selected financial information for our Distribution segment excluding the impact of acquisitions was as follows: Years ended December 31, Favorable/ (Unfavorable) In millions 2010 2009 Amount Percent Excluding acquisitions (1) Sales $ 2,038 $ 1,784 $ 254 14 % EBIT 267 (2) 235 32 14 % (1) The acquisitions represent the purchase of the majority interest in Cummins Western Canada (CWC), an equity investee, in the first quarter of 2010 and the purchase of a majority interest in a previously independent North American distributorship, as explained in Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The acquisition of CWC and the majority interest in the distributorship increased sales by $286 million and EBIT by $30 million in 2010. The 2009 data does not exclude the acquisition which occurred in 2009. (2) This amount includes $13 million of equity earnings which would have been our share of CWC's income for 2010 if we had not consolidated them. Sales Distribution segment sales, excluding the acquisitions, increased versus 2009, due to increased parts and service revenues, increased engine sales driven by sales in Europe and the South Pacific and favorable foreign currency impacts in most regions. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2009, primarily due to increased gross margin and a one-time gain from an acquisition that occurred in the first quarter, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses.

Excluding effects from acquisitions, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to higher salaries and unfavorable foreign currency impacts.

The gains have been excluded from segment results as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, unallocated corporate expenses include $32 million in Brazil tax recoveries ($21 million after-tax) and $2 million in flood damage expenses. The Brazil tax recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, unallocated corporate expenses included $99 million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of $12 million related to flood damage recoveries. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity Our financial condition and liquidity continue to strengthen. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We generate significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to fund repurchases of common stock, capital expenditures and pay dividends on our common stock. Our cash flow from operations in 2011 more than doubled the 2010 cash flow from operations. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2011, other sources of liquidity included: cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion, of which approximately 32 percent was located in the U.S. and 59 percent was located primarily in the U.K., China, Brazil and India, 57 Table of Contents marketable securities of $277 million, which were located primarily in India and Brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days, revolving credit facility with $1.2 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit, international and other domestic credit facilities with $300 million available and accounts receivable sales program with $209 million available, based on eligible receivables. We believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock repurchases and debt service obligations. Our revolving credit agreement provides us with a $1.24 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes. See Note 10, "DEBT" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The credit agreement includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.0 to 1. At December 31, 2011, our leverage ratio was 0.26 to 1. The required interest coverage ratio, which is consolidated EBITDA minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense, in each case for the prior four quarters, may not be less than 1.50 to 1. At December 31, 2011, our interest coverage ratio was 53.62 to 1. A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2011, the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, the vast majority of which was located in the U.K., China, India, Brazil and Singapore. The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our expansion or operating needs with local resources. If the foreign cash balances were repatriated to the U.S. we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes for earnings primarily from our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries, as we have asserted that these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. At present we do not foresee an immediate need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries in the near future. However, we do anticipate repatriating available cash from foreign subsidiaries to help fund U.S. cash needs as they arise, and we have transferred and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to the U.S. and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so. Earnings from our China operations will be considered permanently reinvested beginning in 2012, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have already been recorded, will be repatriated in future years. We continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the European debt crisis. No sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts, while any equities are held with large well-diversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds. In addition, we rebalanced our asset portfolios in the U.S. and the U.K. in 2010 with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios and we continue to rebalance as necessary to maintain our target range. Our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets. The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $17 million to $97 million over each of the next five years. 58 Table of Contents Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

Despite the increases in accounts receivable and inventories, we were able to lower days' sales in receivables in a challenging environment by 11 days through improved collections and we increased our inventory turns by 0.5 through higher demand. Current liabilities increased 12 percent primarily due to higher accounts and loans payable, increased taxes payable due to higher income and higher other accrued expenses, which was the result of increased purchasing requirements to support higher sales volume in the businesses. 59 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased $461 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to a $93 million increase in cash and cash equivalents during the comparable period in 2010. The change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows: Operating Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 In millions 2011 2010 2009 Consolidated net income $ 1,946 $ 1,140 $ 484 $ 806 $ 656 Restructuring and other charges, net of cash payments 16 (16 ) Depreciation and amortization 325 320 326 5 (6 ) Gain on sale of businesses (121 ) (121 ) Gain on fair value adjustment for consolidated investee (12 ) 12 (12 ) Deferred income taxes 85 56 5 29 51 Equity in income of investees, net of dividends (23 ) (147 ) 23 124 (170 ) Pension contributions in excess of expense (131 ) (151 ) (36 ) 20 (115 ) Other post-retirement benefits payments in excess of expense (31 ) (35 ) (24 ) 4 (11 ) Stock-based compensation expense 42 22 20 20 2 Excess tax (benefits) deficiencies on stock-based awards (5 ) (10 ) 1 5 (11 ) Translation and hedging activities 4 13 41 (9 ) (28 ) Changes in: Accounts and notes receivable (350 ) (195 ) (181 ) (155 ) (14 ) Inventories (225 ) (574 ) 482 349 (1,056 ) Other current assets (21 ) (54 ) 33 33 (87 ) Accounts payable 208 345 (75 ) (137 ) 420 Accrued expenses 234 233 (132 ) 1 365 Changes in other liabilities and deferred revenue 139 133 155 6 (22 ) Other, net (3 ) (78 ) (1 ) 75 (77 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,073 $ 1,006 $ 1,137 $ 1,067 $ (131 ) 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2010, primarily due to significantly higher consolidated net income, excluding the gain on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, as a result of higher sales volumes, higher dividends from equity investees and favorable working capital fluctuations. During 2011, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $154 million compared to a cash outflow of $245 million in 2010. This decrease of $91 million was primarily driven by a smaller increase in inventory in 2011 as we significantly increased inventory levels in 2010 to meet anticipated post-recession demand. Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the 60 Table of Contents plans. In the second half of 2011, financial markets in Europe declined significantly, reversing the prior quarters' gains in our U.K. trust investments; while the U.S. trust's liability driven fixed income investments were able to maintain the return trends from the first half of the year. As a result, for 2011 the return for our U.S. plan was 13 percent while our U.K. plan return was approximately six percent. Our U.K. pension plan remains in an over funded position. Approximately 94 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities. The remaining six percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate and private equity. We made $199 million of pension contributions in 2011 (including voluntary contributions of $108 million). We anticipate making total contributions of $130 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012. Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements. 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2009, primarily due to significantly higher inventory levels to meet anticipated demand, increased equity in income of investees net of dividends and higher pension contributions made in the year. This was partially offset by significantly higher consolidated net income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volumes. Investing Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 In millions 2011 2010 2009 Capital expenditures $ (622 ) $ (364 ) $ (310 ) $ (258 ) $ (54 ) Investments in internal use software (60 ) (43 ) (35 ) (17 ) (8 ) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 8 55 10 (47 ) 45 Investments in and advances to equity investees (81 ) (2 ) (3 ) (79 ) 1 Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold 199 199 Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (104 ) (2 ) 104 (102 ) Investments in marketable securities-acquisitions (729 ) (823 ) (431 ) 94 (392 ) Investments in marketable securities-liquidations 750 690 335 60 355 Purchases of other investments (62 ) (62 ) 62 Cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges (18 ) 2 (18 ) (20 ) 20 Other, net 1 7 1 (7 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (552 ) $ (651 ) $ (509 ) $ 99 $ (142 ) 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2010, primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business (See Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS" to our Consolidated Financial Statements ), decreased acquisitions and increased liquidations of marketable securities, the acquisition of CWC in 2010 and decreased purchases of other investments. These drivers were partially offset by increased capital expenditures, additional investments in and advances to equity investees and lower proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. Capital expenditures were $622 million compared to $364 million in the comparable period in 2010. We continue to invest in the development of new products and we plan to spend approximately 61 Table of Contents $800 million to $850 million in 2012 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards. Approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures will be invested outside of the U.S. in 2012. 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2009, primarily due to acquisitions (See Note 2, "DIVESTITURES AND ACQUISITIONS" to our Consolidated Financial Statements ), higher capital expenditures and increased investments in marketable securities, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment. Capital expenditures were $364 million compared to $310 million in 2009.

Our total debt was $783 million as of December 31, 2011, compared with $843 million as of December 31, 2010. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 11.8 percent at December 31, 2011, compared with 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010. 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2009, primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock, which was partially offset by higher proceeds from borrowings primarily related to the acquisition of CWC and borrowings in Brazil. Our total debt was $843 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $703 million at December 31, 2009. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010, compared to 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009. The increase in total debt was principally due to acquisitions and borrowings in Brazil which were subsequently invested in marketable securities. 62 Table of Contents Repurchase of Common Stock In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock, which was completed in February 2011.

The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $86 million as of December 31, 2011. We are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, recoverability of investment related to new products, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product 65 Table of Contents historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 11, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2011 and 2010 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products At December 31, 2011, we have capitalized $221 million associated with the future launch of our light-duty diesel engine product. Development of this product began in 2006. Market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs. At December 31, 2009, we reviewed our investment of $216 million for possible impairment. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down is appropriate. These projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable. Customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the light-duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through 2011 and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2011, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $417 million. These assets included $128 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $71 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4, "INCOME TAXES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to 66 Table of Contents anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5-year average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2011, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 10.0 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2011 one year return was 13 percent, combined with the very favorable returns in 2010 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.0 percent per year in 2012 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of December 31, 2011, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 6.0 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 6.9 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The one year return for our U.K. plan was approximately six percent for 2011 and similar to our U.S. plan, the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 6.5 percent in 2012 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2011 and 2010 and target allocation for 2012 are as follows: U.S. Plans U.K. Plans Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Target Allocation 2012 Target Allocation 2012 Investment description 2011 2010 2011 2010 Equity securities 45.0 % 44.2 % 46.8 % 40.0 % 45.0 % 57.0 % Fixed income 40.0 % 42.2 % 41.2 % 45.0 % 46.0 % 40.0 % Real estate/other 15.0 % 13.6 % 12.0 % 15.0 % 9.0 % 3.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 67 Table of Contents The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2009-2011 and our expected rate for 2012. Long-Term Expected Return Assumptions 2012 2011 2010 2009 U.S. Plans 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.25 % Non-U.S. Plans 6.50 % 7.00 % 7.25 % 7.25 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. GAAP for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligation are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of gains or losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $1,003 million ($669 million after-tax) for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2011, we had net pension actuarial losses of $700 million and $305 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $96 million (after-tax) in 2011. The increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates, partially offset by improved U.S. plan asset performance in 2011. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2009 through 2011 and our expected expense for 2012. Net Periodic Pension Expense In millions 2012 2011 2010 2009 Pension expense $ 68 $ 68 $ 70 $ 93 We expect 2012 pension expense to be approximately the same as 2011, the favorable impacts of investment returns and higher asset values are offset by higher service cost due to increased headcount and a decrease in discount rate. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2011, was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover, strong contributions in 2010 and the absence of any curtailment charges. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover, strong contributions in 2009 and the absence of any curtailment charges. Another key assumption used in the development of the net 68 Table of Contents periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2012 2011 2010 2009 U.S. Plans 4.82 % 5.42 % 5.60 % 6.20 % Non-U.S. Plans 5.20 % 5.80 % 5.80 % 6.20 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Service Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch Ratings and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of December 31, 2011, by at least two of the bond rating agencies. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits. Our model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the U.S. plans and 60 years of payments for the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2012 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In millions Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25 percent increase $ (4 ) 0.25 percent decrease 4 Expected rate of return on assets: One percent increase (32 ) One percent decrease 32 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . 69 Table of Contents RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for impairment. The objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process. The amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The new rules become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, however entities are permitted to early adopt the standard. We elected to early adopt the standard and applied the qualitative analysis to certain reporting units in our 2011 goodwill impairment testing process. Because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed, the standard did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically, this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules were effective for us beginning January 1, 2011. This amendment did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements as multiple element arrangements are not material to our business. In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. The only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to deconsolidate Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) as of January 1, 2010 and to account for CKEC under GAAP for equity method investees. CKEC is an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner. Prior to January 1, 2010, we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this VIE due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the VIE. The impact of the deconsolidation on our Consolidated Statements of Income was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past. The most significant impacts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were to decrease current assets by $9 million, decrease long-term assets by $10 million, increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by $11 million and decrease noncontrolling interest by $11 million in 2010. Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. This information will enable users of 70 Table of Contents the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements ; however we are currently evaluating the potential impacts to our footnote disclosures. In June 2011, the FASB amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements. The new rules are scheduled to become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date, specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income, the standard will not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules will become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level 3. The only impact for us is expected to be the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt obligations).
