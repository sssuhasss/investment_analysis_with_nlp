Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years that end on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the Brand ). Management employs a multi-channel distribution strategy. Management intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets, and by launching e-commerce websites in new markets. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet the requirements of the Brand. To enhance customer awareness. The Brand is the single most important asset of the Company. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase new and existing customer awareness of the Brand and its message, and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To increase store productivity. The Company is committed to growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic, and the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase, through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer-focused initiatives. In addition, in recent years, the Company has opened smaller size stores in the United States which are more comparable to many non-U.S. stores and which have contributed to higher store productivity. To achieve improved operating margins. Management long-term objective is to improve operating margin through greater efficiencies in product sourcing, manufacturing and distribution as well as by controlling selling, general and administrative expenses and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new design collections and expand existing lines. TIFFANY & CO. K - 25 To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and/or polish rough diamonds for use in Company merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and enhancing ongoing training programs. 2011 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 18% to $3,642,937,000, due to growth in all reportable segments. Following a higher-than-expected 24% increase in worldwide net sales in the first nine months of the year, sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter due to decelerated rates of sales growth in most regions. On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures below), worldwide net sales in 2011 increased 15% and comparable store sales increased 13%. The Company added a net of 14 TIFFANY & CO. stores (six in the Americas, six in Asia-Pacific, three in Europe and a net reduction of one in Japan). Operating margin increased 0.1 percentage point. However, the Company recorded charges (primarily within selling, general and administrative expenses) of $42,719,000 in 2011 and $17,635,000 during the prior year associated with Tiffany relocation of its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). Excluding those charges, operating margin increased 0.8 percentage point in 2011. Net earnings increased 19% to $439,190,000, or $3.40 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items in 2011 and 2010 (see Item 6. Selected Financial Data Notes to Selected Financial Data for a listing of those items) net earnings increased 24% to $465,184,000, or $3.60 per diluted share. Consistent with the Company strategy to maintain substantial control over its diamond supply through direct diamond sourcing, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a $50,000,000 amortizing term loan facility agreement with Koidu Holdings S.A. and in return was granted the right to purchase diamonds meeting the Company quality standards recovered from their kimberlite diamond mine in Sierra Leone (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). In May 2011, the Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend on the Company Common Stock increasing the annual dividend rate to $1.16 per share. TIFFANY & CO. K - 26 NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous years: September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, 2011 2010 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 18 % 3 % 15 % 14 % 2 % 12 % Americas 15 1 14 12 1 11 Asia-Pacific 36 5 31 29 6 23 Japan 13 10 3 7 8 (1 ) Europe 17 5 12 18 (5 ) 23 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide 16 % 3 % 13 % 10 % 2 % 8 % Americas 13 13 9 1 8 Asia-Pacific 31 4 27 19 5 14 Japan 13 9 4 4 8 (4 ) Europe 10 4 6 13 (5 ) 18 TIFFANY & CO.

Reference will be made to comparable store sales below. Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores. A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographic market. In Japan, sales for a new store are not included if the store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. Americas . Americas includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores in the United States, Canada and Latin America, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain of those markets through business-to-business, Internet, catalog and wholesale operations. Americas represented 50%, 51% and 52% of worldwide net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, of which the New York Flagship store represented 8%, 8% and 9% of worldwide net sales. In 2011, total sales in the Americas increased $231,212,000, or 15%, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. There was an increase in sales in all jewelry product categories with notable increases at the higher price points. Comparable store sales increased $175,179,000, or 13%, consisting of increases in both New York Flagship store sales of 20% and comparable branch store sales of 12%. Non-comparable store sales grew $47,743,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in the Americas increased 14%, and comparable store sales increased 13%. Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas increased $10,752,000, or 6%, due to an increase in the average sales per order. In 2010, total sales in the Americas increased $163,726,000, or 12%, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales increased $102,802,000, or 9%, consisting of increases in both comparable branch store sales of 9% and New York Flagship store sales of 6%. Non-comparable store sales grew $32,800,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in the Americas increased 11%, and comparable store sales increased 8%. Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas increased $14,142,000, or 8%, due to an increase in the average sales per order. Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through Internet and wholesale operations. Asia-Pacific represented 21%, 18% and 16% of worldwide net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009. TIFFANY & CO. K - 28 In 2011, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $199,017,000, or 36%, due to similar increases in the average price per unit sold and in the number of units sold. There was sales and unit growth in all jewelry product categories. Comparable store sales increased $162,989,000, or 31%, and non-comparable store sales increased $23,830,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 31% and comparable store sales increased 27% due to geographically broad-based sales growth in most markets, especially in the greater China region. In 2010, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $122,901,000, or 29%, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This increase included a comparable store sales increase of $77,353,000, or 19%, and non-comparable store sales growth of $40,722,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 23% and comparable store sales increased 14% due to geographically broad-based sales growth in most markets, especially in the greater China region. Japan. Japan includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. Japan represented 17%, 18% and 19% of worldwide net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2011, total sales in Japan increased $69,968,000, or 13%, due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, which was partly offset by a decline in the number of units sold. Sales growth was strong in both the designer jewelry and engagement jewelry & wedding bands categories. Comparable store sales increased $67,717,000, or 13%. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Japan sales increased 3%, and comparable store sales increased 4%. In 2010, total sales in Japan increased $33,548,000, or 7%, due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, which was partly offset by a decline in the number of units sold. Comparable store sales increased $17,913,000, or 4%, and other non-retail store sales increased $11,599,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Japan sales decreased 1%, and comparable store sales decreased 4%. Europe.

Europe represented 12%, 12% and 11% of worldwide net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The United Kingdom ( U.K. ) represents approximately half of European sales. In 2011, total sales in Europe increased $60,310,000, or 17%, due to similar increases in the number of units sold and in the average price per unit sold. There was sales and unit growth in all jewelry product categories with notable increases in the silver & gold category. Comparable store sales increased $33,021,000, or 10%, and non-comparable store sales increased $20,274,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 12% and comparable store sales increased 6% reflecting relatively stronger sales growth in Continental Europe than in the U.K. In 2010, total sales in Europe increased $54,510,000, or 18%, primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold. This included increased comparable store sales of $34,581,000, or 13%, and non-comparable store sales growth of $19,779,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales increased 23% and comparable store sales increased 18% due to geographically broad-based sales growth. Store Data . In 2011, the Company added a net of 14 stores: six in the Americas (three in the U.S., two in Canada and one in Brazil), six in Asia-Pacific (three in Korea, two in China and one in Taiwan), three in Europe (one each in Germany, Italy and Switzerland) and a net reduction of one in Japan. TIFFANY & CO. K - 29 In 2010, the Company added a net of 13 stores: five in the Americas (all in the U.S.), seven in Asia-Pacific (four in China and one each in Korea, Singapore and Taiwan), two in Europe (Spain and the U.K.) and a net reduction of one in Japan. Sales per gross square foot generated by all stores were approximately $3,000 in 2011, $2,600 in 2010 and $2,400 in 2009. Other. Other consists of all non-reportable segments. Other consists primarily of wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors for resale in certain emerging markets (primarily in the Middle East and Russia) and wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Company needs. In addition, Other includes earnings received from third-party licensing agreements. In 2011, Other sales decreased $2,860,000, or 5% due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds partly offset by higher sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors in emerging markets. In 2010, Other sales increased $901,000, or 2%, as increased wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales of diamonds. Gross Margin September 30, September 30, September 30, 2011 2010 2009 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 59.0 % 59.1 % 56.5 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) decreased by 0.1 percentage point in 2011 primarily due to higher product costs and changes in product mix toward higher-priced jewelry that achieves a lower gross margin partly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Gross margin increased by 2.6 percentage points in 2010 driven primarily by the recapture of higher product costs through retail price increases, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product cost increases, specific market conditions and longer-term changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Among the market conditions that the Company addresses are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions. The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note I. Hedging Instruments ). In 2011 and 2010 the Company increased retail prices to address higher product costs and its strategy is to continue that approach as appropriate in the future. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses September 30, September 30, September 30, 2011 2010 2009 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 39.6 % 39.8 % 40.2 % SG&A expenses increased $215,231,000, or 18%, in 2011 and $137,770,000, or 13%, in 2010. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to several nonrecurring charges. SG&A expenses in 2011 and 2010 included $42,506,000 and $16,625,000 of expenses associated with Tiffany and Company ( Tiffany ) relocation of its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). TIFFANY & CO. K - 30 SG&A expenses in 2009 included $442,000 of income (net) from the following nonrecurring items: $4,442,000 of income received in connection with the assignment of the Tahera Diamond Corporation ( Tahera ) commitments and liens to an unrelated third party (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ); and $4,000,000 charge to terminate a third-party management agreement (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses in 2011, 2010 and 2009 would have been $1,400,222,000, $1,210,872,000 and $1,090,169,000. The increase of $189,350,000, or 16%, in 2011 was largely due to increased labor and benefits costs of $57,672,000, increased depreciation and store occupancy expenses of $56,657,000 due to new and existing stores, and increased marketing expenses of $36,453,000. The increase of $120,703,000, or 11%, in 2010 was largely due to increased marketing expenses of $37,706,000, increased labor and benefits costs of $30,323,000 and increased depreciation and store occupancy expenses of $28,704,000 due to new and existing stores. Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been 38.4%, 39.2% and 40.2% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Company SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. The improvement in SG&A expenses excluding nonrecurring items as a percentage of net sales in 2011 reflected the leverage effect from increased sales. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) represent approximately one-fifth of total SG&A expenses. Earnings from Continuing Operations September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2011 % of Sales* 2010 % of Sales* 2009 % of Sales* Earnings (losses) from continuing operations: Americas $ 387,951 21.5 % $ 340,331 21.6 % $ 263,470 18.7 % Asia-Pacific 205,711 27.5 133,448 24.3 100,690 23.6 Japan 184,767 30.0 162,800 29.8 139,519 27.2 Europe 105,728 25.1 88,309 24.5 60,102 19.6 Other (5,247 ) (10.2 ) 3,358 6.2 (8,767 ) (16.5 ) 878,910 728,246 555,014 Unallocated corporate expenses (127,765 ) (3.5 )% (115,830 ) (3.8 )% (114,964 ) (4.2 )% Other operating income 4,442 Other operating expense (42,719 ) (17,635 ) (4,000 ) Earnings from continuing operations $ 708,426 19.4 % $ 594,781 19.3 % $ 440,492 16.3 % * Percentages represent earnings (losses) from continuing operations as a percentage of each segment net sales. Earnings from continuing operations increased 19% in 2011. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2011 compared with 2010 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 0.1 percentage point primarily due to a decline in gross margin that was offset by the leveraging of operating expenses; TIFFANY & CO. K - 31 Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 3.2 percentage points primarily due to the leveraging of operating expenses as well as a decrease in marketing expenses resulting from a major marketing and public relations event that was held in Beijing, China in 2010; Japan the ratio increased 0.2 percentage point primarily due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased operating expenses; Europe the ratio increased 0.6 percentage point primarily due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased operating expenses; and Other the operating loss is primarily attributable to a valuation adjustment related to the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory deemed not suitable for the Company needs as well as increased spending in the latter part of 2011 for the development of the emerging markets region. Earnings from continuing operations increased 35% in 2010. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 2.9 percentage points primarily due to an increase in gross margin, as well as the leveraging of operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 0.7 percentage point due to an increase in gross margin, which was partly offset by an increase in marketing expenses associated with a major marketing and public relations event held in Beijing, China; Japan the ratio increased 2.6 percentage points primarily due to an increase in gross margin, which was partly offset by an increase in marketing expenses; Europe the ratio increased 4.9 percentage points primarily due to the leveraging of operating expenses, as well as an increase in gross margin; and Other the ratio improved 22.7 percentage points. The prior period operating loss included a valuation adjustment related to the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory deemed not suitable for the Company needs. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses increased in 2011 and 2010 but decreased as a percentage of sales. Other operating income in 2009 represents $4,442,000 of income received in connection with the assignment of the Tahera commitments and liens to an unrelated third party (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). Other operating expense in 2011 and 2010 represents $42,719,000 and $17,635,000 related to Tiffany relocation of its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). Other operating expense in 2009 represents $4,000,000 paid to terminate a third-party management agreement (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). TIFFANY & CO. K - 32 Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs decreased $5,761,000, or 11%, in 2011 primarily due to lower interest rates related to maturing debt that was replaced with new lower-rate borrowings. Interest expense and financing costs decreased $706,000 in 2010. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Other income, net decreased $1,889,000 in 2011 and increased $2,465,000 in 2010 primarily due to changes in foreign currency gains/losses. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 34.0% in 2011, compared with 32.7% in 2010 and 31.9% in 2009. The tax rate for 2010 included a net income tax benefit of $3,096,000 primarily due to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries associated with the acquisition in 2009 of additional equity interests in diamond sourcing and polishing operations. The lower tax rate in 2009 was primarily due to favorable reserve adjustments of $11,220,000 during the year associated with the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of statutory periods. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarter of 2008, management committed to a plan to close all IRIDESSE stores. All stores were closed in 2009. The results of the IRIDESSE business have been recorded in discontinued operations. The pre-tax net loss from discontinued operations related to that business was $6,103,000 in 2009 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). The Company sold Little Switzerland, Inc. in 2007. In 2009, the Company received additional proceeds of $3,650,000 and recorded a pre-tax gain of $3,289,000 in settlement of post-closing adjustments (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). 2012 Outlook Management outlook is based on the following assumptions, which may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with Item 1A. Risk Factors on page K-14: A worldwide net sales increase of approximately 10% for the full year, primarily driven by sales growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. The opening of 24 (net) Company-operated stores (nine in the Americas, seven in Asia-Pacific, three in Europe and commencing operation of five stores in emerging markets). Operating margin approximately equal to 2011 (when excluding nonrecurring items recorded in 2011), with an improved ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales offset by a decline in gross margin. Interest and other expenses, net approximately equal to 2011. An effective income tax rate of approximately 34% 35%. TIFFANY & CO. K - 33 Net earnings per diluted share of $3.95 $4.05, representing a 16% 19% increase over 2011, or a 10% 13% increase when excluding the $0.20 of nonrecurring items in 2011, with most of the year-over-year growth occurring in the latter part of the year. An increase in net inventories of approximately 15%. Capital expenditures of approximately $240,000,000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows and the funds available under its revolving credit facilities are sufficient to support the Company liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. From time to time, the Company may access the debt and capital markets to fund strategic opportunities and for general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2012, the Company cash and cash equivalents totaled $433,954,000, of which approximately half was held in locations outside the U.S. where the Company has the intention to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. Such cash balances are not available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company were to decide to repatriate such funds. The Company intends to use these funds to support its continued expansion and investments outside of the U.S. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate any of those funds held outside the U.S. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 210,606 $ 298,925 $ 687,199 Investing activities (242,583 ) (186,612 ) (80,893 ) Financing activities (213,817 ) (224,799 ) 10,538 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (1,843 ) 8,375 14,300 Net cash used in discontinued operations (5,887 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (247,637 ) $ (104,111 ) $ 625,257 Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $210,606,000 in 2011, $298,925,000 in 2010 and $687,199,000 in 2009. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in inventories partly offset by increased net earnings and adjustments for noncash items. The decrease in 2010 from 2009 primarily resulted from an increase in inventories. TIFFANY & CO. K - 34 Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $2,262,998,000 and 4.6 at January 31, 2012, compared with $2,204,632,000 and 5.6 at January 31, 2011. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2012 were 1% lower than January 31, 2011, reflecting a decline in receivables from independent wholesale distributors. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 20 times in 2011 and 18 times in 2010. Inventories, net at January 31, 2012 were 28% higher than January 31, 2011 with finished goods inventories increasing 16% and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories increasing 46%. The overall increase resulted from store openings, product introductions and expanded assortments, and higher product and raw material acquisition costs. In addition, the increase in raw material and work-in-process inventories reflected further vertical integration of the Company diamond supply chain. Investing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from investing activities of $242,583,000 in 2011, $186,612,000 in 2010 and $80,893,000 in 2009. The increased outflow in 2011 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and notes receivable funded which was partly offset by net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments. The increased outflow in 2010 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores, distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in new systems. Capital expenditures were $239,443,000 in 2011, $127,002,000 in 2010 and $75,403,000 in 2009, representing 7%, 4% and 3% of net sales in those respective years. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to the relocation of the New York headquarters and an increased number of store renovations. The increase in 2010 followed a moderated rate of store openings and other cost containment in 2009. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short term investments of $55,139,000 during 2011 and net purchases of investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of $59,610,000 and $13,433,000 during 2010 and 2009. Notes Receivable Funded. The Company may, from time to time, extend loans to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine output. In 2011, the Company loaned $56,605,000 to various companies of which $50,000,000 was provided to Koidu Holdings S.A. (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note K. Commitments and Contingencies ). Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $213,817,000 in 2011 and $224,799,000 in 2010 and a net cash inflow of $10,538,000 in 2009. Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities are largely driven by share repurchase activity, borrowings and cash dividends on common stock. Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company Common Stock was increased once in 2011, twice in 2010 and did not change in 2009. The Company Board of Directors declared quarterly TIFFANY & CO. K - 35 dividends which, on an annual basis, totaled $1.12, $0.95 and $0.68 per common share in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Cash dividends paid were $142,840,000, $120,390,000 and $84,579,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 33%, 33% and 32% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Share Repurchases. In January 2008, the Company Board of Directors amended the existing share repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program to January 2011 and to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional $500,000,000 of the Company Common Stock. In January 2011, the Company Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program ( 2011 Program ) and terminated the previously existing program. The 2011 Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $400,000,000 of its Common Stock through open market or private transactions. The 2011 Program expires on January 31, 2013. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as stock price, cash-flow forecasts and other market conditions. The Company share repurchase activity was as follows: September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Cost of repurchases $ 174,118 $ 80,786 $ 467 Shares repurchased and retired 2,629 1,843 11 Average cost per share $ 66.23 $ 43.83 $ 41.72 The Company suspended share repurchases during the third quarter of 2008 in order to conserve cash. In January 2010, the Company resumed repurchasing its shares of Common Stock on the open market. At January 31, 2012, there remained $217,901,000 of authorization for future repurchases under the 2011 Program. At least annually, the Company Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Recent Borrowings. The Company had net repayments of or net proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Short-term borrowings: Proceeds from (repayment of) credit facility borrowings, net $ 13,548 $ 9,170 $ (126,811 ) Proceeds from other credit facilities 61,020 Repayments of other credit facilities (4,517 ) Repayments of other short-term borrowings (93,000 ) Net proceeds from (repayments of) short-term borrowings 70,051 9,170 (219,811 ) Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from issuance 118,430 300,000 Repayments (58,915 ) (218,845 ) (40,000 ) Net (repayments of) proceeds from long-term borrowings (58,915 ) (100,415 ) 260,000 Net proceeds from (repayments of) total borrowings $ 11,136 $ (91,245 ) $ 40,189 TIFFANY & CO. K - 36 In December 2011, the Company entered into a three-year $200,000,000 revolving credit facility and a five-year $200,000,000 revolving credit facility (the Credit Facilities ). Under the Credit Facilities, borrowings may be made from 10 participating banks at interest rates based upon either (i) local currency borrowing rates or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, whichever is higher, plus a margin based on the Company leverage ratio. The Credit Facilities replaced the Company previous $400,000,000 multi-bank revolving credit facility. Borrowings were at interest rates based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin based on the Company leverage ratio. In May 2011, the Company entered into a 4,000,000,000 ($49,240,000 at issuance) one-year uncommitted credit facility. Borrowings may be made on one-, three- or 12-month terms bearing interest at the LIBOR rate plus 0.25%, subject to bank approval. In total, there was $112,973,000 outstanding and $389,159,000 available under all revolving credit facilities at January 31, 2012. The weighted-average interest rate for the outstanding amount at January 31, 2012 was 1.47%. In 2010 and 2009, proceeds from long-term debt issuances and other short-term borrowings were used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Long-term debt issued in 2010 has a maturity date of 2016 at an interest rate of 1.72%. Long-term debt issued in 2009 has maturity dates that range from 2017 to 2019 at interest rates of 10.00%. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note H. Debt for additional details. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders equity was 30% and 32% at January 31, 2012 and 2011. At January 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Purchase of Non-controlling Interests. In October 2009, the Company acquired all non-controlling interests in two majority-owned entities that indirectly engage through majority-owned subsidiaries in diamond sourcing and polishing operations in South Africa and Botswana, respectively, for total consideration of $18,000,000, of which $11,000,000 was paid in 2009 and the remaining $7,000,000 was paid during 2010. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2012: September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands) Total 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 1,425,498 $ 181,477 $ 320,026 $ 240,635 $ 683,360 Inventory purchase obligations a 441,760 383,317 58,443 Interest on debt b 229,382 43,142 82,609 71,784 31,847 Other contractual obligations c 41,458 35,205 5,147 1,106 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 112,973 112,973 Long-term debt 599,174 60,822 238,352 300,000 $ 2,850,245 $ 816,936 $ 466,225 $ 551,877 $ 1,015,207 a) The Company will, from time to time, secure supplies of diamonds by agreeing to purchase a defined portion of a mine output. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated for 2012 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2012 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. TIFFANY & CO. K - 37 b) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. c) Consists primarily of royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $35,000,000 to the pension plan in 2012. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. In addition, the Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $2,461,000 in 2012. Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2012 of $25,509,000 and accrued interest and penalties of $7,228,000. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Management anticipates that it is reasonably possible that the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $20,000,000 in the next 12 months, a portion of which may affect the effective tax rate; however, management does not currently anticipate a significant effect on net earnings. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. The following is a summary of the Company outstanding borrowings and available capacity under its credit facilities at January 31, 2012: September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands) Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Available Capacity Three-year revolving credit facility a $ 200,000 $ 3,380 $ 196,620 Five-year revolving credit facility b 200,000 25,824 174,176 Other credit facilities 102,132 83,769 18,363 $ 502,132 $ 112,973 $ 389,159 a This facility matures in December 2014.

In addition, the Company had letters of credit and financial guarantees of $27,880,000 at January 31, 2012, of which $17,849,000 expire within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing at least one-third of annual net sales and approximately one-half of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require TIFFANY & CO. K - 38 management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2012, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $5,394,000 in inventory and cost of sales. The Company inventories are valued using the average cost method. Fluctuation in inventory levels, along with raw material costs, could affect the carrying value of the Company inventory. Long-lived assets . The Company long-lived assets are primarily property, plant and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2011, 2010 and 2009 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. The Company income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely- TIFFANY & CO. K - 39 than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. In evaluating the Company ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 6.00% to determine its 2011 pension expense for all U.S. plans and 6.25% to determine its 2011 postretirement expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2011 pension and postretirement expenses by $3,820,000 and $302,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2011 pension and postretirement expenses by $4,227,000 and $537,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2011 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2011 pension expense by $1,248,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, 8.50% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 7.00% (for post-age 65 retirees) annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2012. The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2020 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2011 postretirement expense.
