Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. As a result of the acquisitions and divestures discussed below, many comparisons between periods will be difficult or impossible. In July 2012, we acquired producing and non-producing assets from Three Rivers Operating Company (the Three Rivers Acquisition ) for cash consideration of approximately $1.0 billion. The Three Rivers Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. The results of operations prior to July 2012 do not include results from the Three Rivers Acquisition. In December 2012, we closed on the sale of certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million (included in discontinued operations). For the year ended December 31, 2012, these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day. Certain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development and exploration of producing oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We refer to our three core operating areas as the (i) New Mexico Shelf, where we primarily target the Yeso formation with horizontal and vertical development, (ii) Delaware Basin, where we use horizontal drilling and technology to target the Bone Spring formation, including the Avalon shale, Bone Spring sands, and the Wolfcamp shale formation, and (iii) Texas Permian in the Midland Basin, where we target the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations with horizontal and vertical development. Oil comprised 58.1 percent of our 637.2 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2014 and 64.4 percent of our 40.9 MMBoe of production for 2014. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 92.3 percent of our proved developed producing PV-10 and 79.5 percent of our approximately 7,208 gross wells at December 31, 2014. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. 44 Financial and Operating Performance Our financial and operating performance for 2014 included the following highlights: Net income was $ 538.2 million ($4.88 per diluted share), as compared to net income of $251.0 million ($ 2.39 per diluted share) in 2013. The increase in earnings was primarily due to: $340.2 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues as a result of a 22 percent increase in production partially offset by a 6 percent decrease in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities) ; $ 890.9 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $ 123.7 million loss during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily related to commodity future price curves at the respective measurement periods; and partially offset by: $447.2 million in non-cash impairment charges in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in our estimated future cash flows related to management outlook of future commodity prices and costs, as compared to a $65.4 million non-cash impairment charge in 2013 due primarily to downward adjustments to our economically recoverable proved reserves ; $175.3 million increase in exploration and abandonments in 2014 as compared to 2013 ; $207.1 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to increased production from costs incurred associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2013 and 2014 ; $82.9 million increase in oil and natural gas production costs due in part to increased production related to our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2013 and 2014; $34.3 million increase in general and administrative expense due to an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses to manage our increased activities related to our increased drilling and exploration activities ; and $199.5 million increase in income tax expense due to the increase in income before income taxes resulting in a 37.1 percent effective tax rate. Average daily sales volumes increased by 22 percent from 92,150 Boe per day during 2013 to 111,987 Boe per day during 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to our successful drilling efforts during 2013 and 2014 , partially offset by normal production declines. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $311.8 million to $1,673.8 million for 2014, as compared to $1,362.0 m illion in 2013, primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas revenues and a smaller negative variance in working capital changes, which adjust for the timing of receipts and payments of actual cash, partially offset by increases in oil and natural gas production costs. Long-term debt decreased by approximately $0.1 billion during 2014, primarily due to utilizing a portion of the net proceeds from our equity offering to repay borrowings under our credit facility, partially offset by capital expenditures primarily related to our drilling program in excess of our cash flows. 45 Commodity Prices Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to (i) relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, (ii) market uncertainty and (iii) a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, include: continuing economic uncertainty worldwide; political and economic developments in oil and natural gas producing regions, including Africa, South America and the Middle East; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil prices and production controls; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; the effect of energy conservation efforts; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including limits on the United States ability to export crude oil, and taxation; the level of global inventories; the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities, as well as the availability of commodity processing and gathering and refining capacity; the quality of the oil we produce; the overall global demand for oil natural gas and natural gas liquids; the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; and overall North American oil and natural gas supply and demand fundamentals, including: the United States economy impact, weather conditions, and the potential for liquefied natural gas deliveries to and exports from the United States. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2014. 46 Oil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. Average oil prices have decreased during 2014 compared to 2013 while natural gas prices have increased over the comparative same period. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, as well as the high and low NYMEX price for the same periods: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Average NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl) $ 92.94 $ 98.05 $ 94.19 Natural gas (MMBtu) $ 4.27 $ 3.73 $ 2.83 High and Low NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl): High $ 107.26 $ 110.53 $ 109.77 Low $ 53.27 $ 86.68 $ 77.69 Natural gas (MMBtu): High $ 6.15 $ 4.46 $ 3.90 Low $ 2.89 $ 3.11 $ 1.91 Further, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $53.53 and $44.45 per Bbl and $3.23 and $2.58 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2015 to February 24, 2015. At February 24, 2015, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $49.28 per Bbl and $2.90 per MMBtu, respectively. Historically, approximately 55 to 80 percent of our total natural gas revenues have been derived from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. Because of our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues historically, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) has reflected a price greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price. The Mont Belvieu prices for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids in 2014 ranged from a high of $43.76 per Bbl to a low of $19.99 per Bbl. Further, the Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids for January 2015 was $18.08 per Bbl. 47 Recent Events 2015 capital budget . In January 2015, we announced our updated 2015 capital budget of approximately $2.0 billion, of which approximately 90 percent of the drilling and completion costs will be dedicated to horizontal drilling. Our 2015 capital program is expected to continue focusing on drilling in the Delaware Basin and Midland Basin. The 2015 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and cost, will exceed our cash flow. We expect our cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital expenditure needs during 2015. However, if we experience sustained commodity prices lower than our forecasted pricing without sufficient cost reductions, we may adjust our capital budget to preserve financial strength. 2015 Capital (in billions) Budget Drilling and completion costs: Delaware Basin $ 1.3 Texas Permian 0.3 New Mexico Shelf 0.2 Total drilling and completion costs 1.8 Other capital (a) 0.2 Total $ 2.0 (a) Includes facilities, leasehold acquisitions, a midstream project, geological and geophysical data and other capital. Weather event. H eavy rainfall and flooding during the latter part of September 2014 disrupted our operations, primarily in southeast New Mexico, causing shut-in production, road closures and drilling and completion delays. We estimate this weather-related downtime negatively impacted production for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 by approximately 1.6 MBoepd. We estimate that during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 approximately $1.7 million of repairs was due to this event. Common stock offering. In May 2014, we issued in a secondary public offering approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock at $129.00 per share, and we received net proceeds of approximately $932.0 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and plan to use the remainder for general corporate purposes, including funding our drilling program and capital commitments associated with the midstream joint venture. Delaware Basin midstream agreements . On May 9, 2014, we signed an agreement to own 50 percent of a joint venture, Alpha Crude Connector, LLC ( ACC ), which will build a crude oil pipeline to gather and transport oil production in the northern Delaware Basin. Additionally, on May 9, 2014, we entered into a ten year Crude Petroleum Dedication and Transportation Agreement with ACC to transport our oil production in the northern Delaware Basin. We expect to receive improved price realizations on our crude oil subject to this dedication agreement due to reduced transportation costs and increased marketing influence due to concentrated volumes. Amended and restated credit facility. On May 9, 2014, we amended and restated our credit facility, increasing our borrowing base from $3.0 billion to $3.25 billion, but maintaining the aggregate lender commitments at $2.5 billion. The maturity date of the amended and restated credit facility is May 9, 2019. We expensed approximately $4.3 million in capitalized deferred loan costs incurred with the previous credit facility. 48 Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2014 , the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net asset of $ 752.7 million. All of our counterparties to these financial derivatives are parties to our credit facility and have their outstanding debt commitments and derivative exposures collateralized pursuant to our credit facility. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments and their collateralization under our credit facility, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. We currently have no reason to believe that our counterparties to these commodity derivative contracts are not financially viable. Our credit facility does not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. New commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2014, we entered into the following additional oil price swaps and oil basis swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total Oil Swaps: (a) 2015: Volume (Bbl) - 660,000 660,000 660,000 1,980,000 Price per Bbl $ - $ 56.60 $ 56.60 $ 56.60 $ 56.60 2016: Volume (Bbl) 180,000 180,000 180,000 2,610,000 3,150,000 Price per Bbl $ 61.04 $ 61.04 $ 61.04 $ 62.48 $ 62.23 Oil Basis Swaps: (b) 2016: Volume (Bbl) 364,000 364,000 368,000 368,000 1,464,000 Price per Bbl $ (2.48) $ (2.48) $ (2.48) $ (2.48) $ (2.48) (a) The index prices for the oil price swaps are based on the NYMEX WTI monthly average futures price. (b) The basis differential price is between Midland WTI and Cushing WTI. 49 Results of Operations The following table sets forth summary information concerning our production and operating data from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The table below excludes production and operating data that we have classified as discontinued operations, which is more fully described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from the Three Rivers Acquisition for periods prior to July 2012. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities, fluctuations in commodity prices and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Production and operating data from continuing operations: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 26,319 21,126 16,859 Natural gas (MMcf) 87,336 75,054 66,613 Total (MBoe) 40,875 33,635 27,961 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 72,107 57,879 46,063 Natural gas (Mcf) 239,277 205,627 182,003 Total (Boe) 111,987 92,150 76,397 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 83.17 $ 91.76 $ 87.96 Oil, with derivatives (Bbl) (a) $ 86.07 $ 89.79 $ 89.29 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 5.39 $ 5.08 $ 5.06 Natural gas, with derivatives (Mcf) (a) $ 5.34 $ 5.21 $ 5.07 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 65.08 $ 68.97 $ 65.08 Total, with derivatives (Boe) (a) $ 66.84 $ 68.01 $ 65.93 Operating costs and expenses per Boe: Lease operating expenses and workover costs $ 8.05 $ 7.85 $ 6.90 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 5.12 $ 5.69 $ 5.39 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 23.97 $ 22.97 $ 20.56 General and administrative $ 4.99 $ 5.04 $ 4.79 (a) Includes the effect of cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 Cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ 76,335 $ (41,616) $ 22,411 Natural gas derivatives (4,352) 9,275 1,125 Total $ 71,983 $ (32,341) $ 23,536 The presentation of average prices with derivatives is a non-GAAP measure as a result of including the cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives that are presented in our statements of cash flows. This presentation of average prices with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective periods and presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives in a manner consistent with the presentation generally used by the investment community. 50 The following table sets forth summary information from our discontinued operations concerning our production and operating data for the year ended December 31, 2012. The discontinued operations presentation is the result of reclassifying the results of operations from the divestiture of our non-core assets in December 2012 which is more fully described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Year Ended December 31, 2012 Production and operating data from discontinued operations: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 1,144 Natural Gas (Mcf) 3,978 Total (MBoe) 1,807 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 3,126 Natural gas (Mcf) 10,869 Total (Boe) 4,937 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 88.60 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 4.67 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 66.37 Operating costs and expenses per Boe: Lease operating expenses and workover costs $ 12.95 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 6.01 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 16.68 General and administrative (a) $ (1.38) (a) Represents the fees received from third-parties for operating oil and natural gas properties that were sold. We reflect these fees as a reduction of general and administrative expenses. 51 The following tables present selected production and operating data for the fields which represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: Year Ended December 31, 2014 South Basin Yeso Avalon Central Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 5,227 2,991 Natural gas (MMcf) 23,027 13,936 Total (MBoe) 9,065 5,314 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 82.04 $ 86.06 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 4.91 $ 6.35 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 59.78 $ 65.08 Production costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses including workovers $ 5.00 $ 8.56 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 4.38 $ 5.72 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Wolfberry Yeso West Central Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 3,509 2,157 Natural gas (MMcf) 11,238 8,122 Total (MBoe) 5,382 3,511 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 93.05 $ 90.42 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 6.15 $ 6.24 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 73.51 $ 70.00 Production costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses including workovers $ 9.30 $ 12.38 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 5.68 $ 6.25 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Wolfberry Yeso West Central Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 3,402 4,053 Natural gas (MMcf) 10,399 14,915 Total (MBoe) 5,135 6,539 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 88.22 $ 88.52 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 6.14 $ 6.28 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 70.87 $ 69.19 Production costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses including workovers $ 7.45 $ 7.43 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 5.11 $ 5.97 52 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $2,660.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of $340.2 million (15 percent ) from $2,319.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . This increase was primarily due to increased production due to our successful drilling efforts during 2013 and 2014 as well as an increase in the realized natural gas prices, partially offset by the decrease in realized oil prices. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 26,319 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of 5,193 MBbl (25 percent ) from 21,126 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2013 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $83.17 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2014 , a decrease of 9 percent from $91.76 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we realized approximately 89.5 percent and 93.6 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX oil prices for the respective periods. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil has a direct effect on our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing (sweet barrel) was a price reduction of $6.91 per Bbl and $2.63 per Bbl, respectively; total natural gas production was 87,336 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of 12,282 MMcf (16 percent ) from 75,054 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2013 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $5.39 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of 6 percent from $5.08 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2013 . For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we realized approximately 126.2 percent and 136.2 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Historically, approximately 55 to 80 percent of our total natural gas revenues were derived from the value of the natural gas liquids, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. Because of our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues historically, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) has reflected a price greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price. The deterioration of our realization percentage between comparable periods was primarily related to a combination of (i) a higher average NYMEX natural gas price between comparable periods ($4.27 per MMBtu in 2014 compared to $3.73 per MMBtu in 2013) and (ii) a lower price being received for the value of our natural gas liquids included within our natural gas revenue stream. We estimate that between the comparable periods, the value we received per gallon of natural gas liquids decreased approximately 4 percent, which is primarily the result of an increase in the supply of natural gas liquids from the significant industry drilling in liquid-prone areas. Heavy rainfall and flooding during the latter part of September 2014 disrupted our operations, primarily in southeast New Mexico, causing shut-in production, road closures and drilling and completion delays. We estimate this weather-related downtime negatively impacted production for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 by approximately 1.6 MBoepd. We estimate that during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 approximately $1.7 million of repairs was due to this event. During the fourth quarter of 2013, severe winter weather events across the Permian Basin had a significant impact on our production and drilling operations. We experienced widespread power outages, heavy icing, trucking curtailments, and facility freeze-ups across all three of our core areas. We estimate that these weather events reduced our volumes for 2013 by approximately 114 MBoe. During 2013, the natural gas processing infrastructure in our New Mexico Shelf area struggled to support the rapid growth of natural gas supply due to increased drilling by us and other producers over the recent past. During the second quarter of 2013, we noted that (i) certain additional natural gas processing capacity that was scheduled to be operational had been delayed to later in 2013 and (ii) approximately 20 MMcf per day of natural gas processing capacity, located near our recent drilling activity, had been taken out of service due to mechanical issues. During the second half of 2013, some of the effects of these infrastructure issues were mitigated through (i) temporarily moving additional natural gas volumes to other third-party processors and (ii) an improvement in operating run times and operational efficiencies of certain third-party processors. We estimate these infrastructure constraints, which in part caused us to flare limited natural gas volumes, reduced our volumes for 2013 by approximately 515 MBoe. 53 Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 310,284 $ 7.59 $ 248,436 $ 7.39 Taxes: Ad valorem 20,775 0.51 22,979 0.68 Production 188,348 4.61 168,585 5.01 Workover costs 18,967 0.46 15,436 0.46 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 538,374 $ 13.17 $ 455,436 $ 13.54 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices. Lease operating expenses were $310.3 million ($7.59 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2014 , which was an increase of $61.9 million (25 percent) from $248.4 million ($7.39 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2013 and 2014. The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to expansion of our production in areas with underdeveloped infrastructure. We estimate that during the year ended December 31, 2014 approximately $2.5 million ($0.06 per Boe) of repairs was due to weather events. Production taxes per unit of production were $4.61 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2014 , a decrease of 8 percent from $5.01 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2013 . The decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil prices. Over the same period, our per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 6 percent. Workover expenses were approximately $19.0 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 and 2013 expenses related primarily to routine workovers performed to increase or restore production . Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 Geological and geophysical $ 19,268 $ 27,690 Exploratory dry hole costs 44,180 29,514 Leasehold abandonments 217,326 49,758 Other 4,047 2,587 Total exploration and abandonments $ 284,821 $ 109,549 Our geological and geophysical expense primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis, mostly related to our Delaware Basin and Texas Permian areas. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we acquired geological and geophysical data related to our northern Delaware Basin acreage. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we had multiple seismic projects ongoing, which were completed during the second half of 2013. These projects were related to our increase in drilling and exploration activity in the Delaware Basin and Texas Permian core areas. 54 During the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our assessment of our activity in the outer limits of our southern Delaware Basin acreage position. Based on our analysis and marginal results of our exploratory wells on this acreage, we have no further plans to invest in this position. Accordingly, we recognized approximately $32.7 million in exploratory dry hole costs and approximately $96.4 million in leasehold abandonments in 2014. During 2014, we recognized exploratory dry hole costs of approximately $44.2 million. In addition to the $32.7 million (discussed above), we recognized $6.3 million of dry hole costs related to two New Mexico Shelf wells that encountered mechanical issues while drilling and one Delaware Basin well targeting the Brushy Canyon horizon that was testing the outer limits of our acreage. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $217.3 million primarily related to (i) the Delaware Basin abandonment discussed above, as well as (ii) an $86.0 million charge related to properties in our Texas Permian core area that, based on our historical results and our estimate of reduced future commodity price, we have no future intent to drill based on expected low rates of return. The remaining abandonment charges are associated with expiring acreage and acreage determined to be outside of our economically productive reservoirs. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our assessment of our activity on our northern Midland Basin acreage position. Our initial wells on this acreage were uneconomic. We have no further plans to invest in this position. Accordingly, we recognized $14.8 million in exploratory dry hole costs and $34.9 million in leasehold abandonments in 2013. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily related to (i) partial expensing of unsuccessful horizontal laterals on two wells in the Delaware Basin, (ii) an unsuccessful vertical well in the New Mexico Shelf area that was testing the eastern boundaries of the area, (iii) partial expensing of unsuccessful horizontal laterals in the New Mexico Shelf area and (iv) the northern Midland Basin wells (noted above). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 960,931 $ 23.51 $ 755,952 $ 22.48 Depreciation of other property and equipment 17,348 0.42 15,195 0.45 Amortization of intangible asset - operating rights 1,461 0.04 1,461 0.04 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 979,740 $ 23.97 $ 772,608 $ 22.97 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 91.48 $ 93.42 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 4.35 $ 3.67 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $960.9 million ($23.51 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $204.9 million (27 percent) from $756.0 million ($22.48 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to increased production associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2013 and 2014 and a higher per unit depletion rate. The increase in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) drilling deeper, higher cost wells in less proven areas and (ii) increasing production in our newer asset areas, such as the Delaware Basin, where we have a higher depletion rate than our legacy assets, such as the New Mexico Shelf. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with our increase in depreciation of other property and equipment related to buildings and other items as a result of our increased number of employees. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to a decrease in our estimated future cash flows related to management outlook of future commodity prices and costs, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $447.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily attributable to 55 (i) non-core properties in our Delaware Basin area, (ii) properties producing from the Grayburg San Andres reservoir in our New Mexico Shelf area and (iii) properties producing from the Canyon and Wolfcamp reservoirs primarily in Irion and Glasscock counties in our Texas Permian core area. Due primarily to downward adjustments to the economically recoverable proved reserves associated with declines in well performance and decreases in estimated realized natural gas prices, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $65.4 million during the second quarter of 2013, which was primarily attributable to non-core natural gas related properties in our New Mexico Shelf area. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows may change in the future resulting in the need to further impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect management estimates of future cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (iv) results of future drilling activities. Additionally, based on the factors above as of December 31, 2014, we determined that undiscounted future cash flows attributable to certain depletion groups indicated that their carrying amounts were expected to be recovered; however, they may be at risk for impairment if management estimates of future cash flows further decline. We estimate that if these depletion groups were to become impaired in a future period, we may recognize a significant non-cash impairment in that period. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 180,278 $ 4.41 $ 153,199 $ 4.55 Non-cash stock-based compensation 47,130 1.15 35,078 1.04 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (23,247) (0.57) (18,462) (0.55) Total general and administrative expenses $ 204,161 $ 4.99 $ 169,815 $ 5.04 General and administrative expenses were approximately $204.2 million ($4.99 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of $34.4 million (20 percent) from $169.8 million ($5.04 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase in cash general and administrative expenses of approximately $27.1 million was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses. The increase in non-cash stock-based compensation of approximately $12.1 million was primarily due to (i) an increase in the number of employees in order to manage our increased activities directly related to our increased drilling and exploration activities and (ii) a $2.3 million ($0.07 per Boe) net benefit to stock-based compensation related to forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards associated with two officer resignations included in 2013. As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $23.2 million and $18.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements was primarily due to increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated as a result of continued drilling activity period over period. 56 (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 Gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ 869,421 $ (133,890) Natural gas derivatives 21,496 10,238 Total $ 890,917 $ (123,652) The following table represents our cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 Cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ 76,335 $ (41,616) Natural gas derivatives (4,352) 9,275 Total $ 71,983 $ (32,341) Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2014 2013 Interest expense $ 216,661 $ 218,581 Capitalized interest 2,282 - Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest $ 218,943 $ 218,581 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility 2.4% 2.3% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes 5.9% 6.1% Total weighted average interest rate 5.8% 5.7% Weighted average credit facility balance $ 144,966 $ 327,488 Weighted average senior notes balance 3,350,000 3,117,222 Total weighted average debt balance $ 3,494,966 $ 3,444,710 The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013 was due to capital expenditures primarily related to our drilling program in excess of our cash flows, offset by cash received from our equity offering. The increase in interest expense was due to an overall increase in the weighted average debt balance and interest rate. 57 Loss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.3 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 amount represents the proportional amount of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with banks with lesser commitments in the amended credit facility syndicate. The 2013 amount includes approximately $20.4 million associated with the premium paid for the tender and redemption of the 8.625% Notes, approximately $5.5 million of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the 8.625% Notes and approximately $2.7 million of unamortized discount on the 8.625% Notes. Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax expense of $317.8 million and $118.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 37.1 percent and 33.1 percent, respectively. We recorded a $7.9 million and $21.9 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to a decrease in our estimated overall state tax rate utilized to record our net deferred tax liability. During 2013, the state of New Mexico passed legislation to phase in a tax rate reduction over the next five years from 7.6 percent in 2013 to 5.9 percent in 2018. Additionally, we continuously evaluate the state apportionment, and based on our current forecast, along with the New Mexico rate declines, we have revised our state rate. During 2014, the change in our blended state rate did not have a material effect on our overall effective tax rate. Excluding the effect of the New Mexico state rate reduction, our effective rate would have been 39.2 percent in 2013, which would approximate a more normalized effective income tax rate. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. In December 2012, we closed the sale of certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million. As a result of post-closing adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2013, we made a positive adjustment to gain (loss) on disposition of assets of approximately $19.6 million. We recognized income from discontinued operations, net of tax of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The results of operations of these assets are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and are described in more detail in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 58 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $2,319.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $500.1 million (27 percent ) from $1,819.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This increase was primarily due to an increase in the realized oil price and increased production due to (i) successful drilling efforts during 2012 and 2013 and (ii) production from the Three Rivers Acquisition, which closed in July 2012. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 21,126 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 4,267 MBbl (25 percent ) from 16,859 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2012 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $91.76 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of 4 percent from $87.96 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we realized approximately 93.6 percent and 93.4 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX oil prices for the respective periods. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil has a direct effect on our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing (sweet barrel) was a price reduction of $2.63 per Bbl and $2.91 per Bbl, respectively; total natural gas production was 75,054 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 8,441 MMcf (13 percent ) from 66,613 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2012 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $5.08 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2013 , a slight increase from $5.06 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2012 . For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we realized approximately 136.2 percent and 178.8 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Historically, approximately 55 to 80 percent of our total natural gas revenues were derived from the value of the natural gas liquids, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. Because of our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues historically, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) has reflected a price greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price. The deterioration of our realization percentage between comparable periods was primarily related to a combination of (i) a higher average NYMEX natural gas price between comparable periods ($3.73 per MMBtu in 2013 compared to $2.83 per MMBtu in 2012) and (ii) a lower price being received for the value of our natural gas liquids included within our natural gas revenue stream. We estimate that between the comparable periods, the value we received per gallon of natural gas liquids decreased approximately 13 percent, which is primarily the result of an increase in the supply of natural gas liquids from the significant industry drilling in liquid-prone areas. During the fourth quarter of 2013, severe winter weather events across the Permian Basin had a significant impact on our production and drilling operations. We experienced widespread power outages, heavy icing, trucking curtailments, and facility freeze-ups across all three of our core areas. We estimate that these weather events reduced our volumes for 2013 by approximately 114 MBoe. The natural gas processing infrastructure in our New Mexico Shelf area struggled to support the rapid growth of natural gas supply due to increased drilling by us and other producers over the recent past. During the second quarter of 2013, we noted that (i) certain additional natural gas processing capacity that was scheduled to be operational had been delayed to later in 2013 and (ii) approximately 20 MMcf per day of natural gas processing capacity, located near our recent drilling activity, had been taken out of service due to mechanical issues, which we expect to return to service during the first half of 2014. During the second half of 2013, some of the effects of these infrastructure issues were mitigated through (i) temporarily moving additional natural gas volumes to other third-party processors and (ii) an improvement in operating run times and operational efficiencies of certain third-party processors. We estimate these infrastructure constraints, which in part caused us to flare limited natural gas volumes, reduced our volumes for 2013 by approximately 515 MBoe. As a result, we noted during the second quarter of 2013 that we were redirecting a portion of our remaining New Mexico Shelf drilling budget to other areas, such as the Delaware Basin, until sufficient natural gas processing infrastructure is implemented and performing at consistent levels. 59 Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 248,436 $ 7.39 $ 182,716 $ 6.53 Taxes: Ad valorem 22,979 0.68 13,695 0.49 Production 168,585 5.01 137,106 4.90 Workover costs 15,436 0.46 10,226 0.37 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 455,436 $ 13.54 $ 343,743 $ 12.29 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expenses were $248.4 million ($7.39 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which was an increase of $65.7 million (36 percent) from $182.7 million ($6.53 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to increased continuing operations production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2012 and 2013 and the acquisitions in 2012. The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) expansion of our production in areas with underdeveloped infrastructure causing a broader use of rental equipment, (ii) increased lease operating expenses per Boe related to our properties acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition as compared to our legacy properties and (iii) some minimal costs increases in services. Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations of our Texas properties and the increase in the number of wells primarily associated with our 2012 and 2013 drilling activity in our Texas Permian area, the Texas portion of the Delaware Basin and the Texas properties acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition. Production taxes per unit of production were $5.01 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 2 percent from $4.90 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase was directly related to the increase in commodity prices. Over the same period, our per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 6 percent. Workover expenses were approximately $15.4 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2013 and 2012 amounts related primarily to routine workovers in the Texas Permian and New Mexico Shelf areas performed to increase or restore production. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 Geological and geophysical $ 27,690 $ 16,581 Exploratory dry hole costs 29,514 7,518 Leasehold abandonments 49,758 12,395 Other 2,587 3,346 Total exploration and abandonments $ 109,549 $ 39,840 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, primarily relating to our Delaware Basin area, was approximately $27.7 million and 60 $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 is due to our increased drilling and exploration activity in the Delaware Basin area. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our assessment of our activity on our northern Midland Basin acreage position. Our initial wells on this acreage were uneconomic. We have no further plans to invest in this position. Accordingly, we recognized $14.8 million in exploratory dry hole costs and $34.9 million in leasehold abandonments in 2013. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily related to (i) partial expensing of unsuccessful horizontal laterals on two wells in the Delaware Basin, (ii) an unsuccessful vertical well in the New Mexico Shelf area that was testing the eastern boundaries of the area, (iii) partial expensing of unsuccessful horizontal laterals in the New Mexico Shelf area and (iv) the northern Midland Basin wells (noted above). Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 were primarily related to (i) expensing an unsuccessful lateral on a horizontal well due to mechanical issues in the Delaware Basin area, (ii) expensing a dry hole that logged no pay in the Lower Abo formation in the New Mexico Shelf area and (iii) expensing the costs of drilling a well that experienced mechanical issues in the Texas Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , we recorded approximately $49.8 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to (i) abandonment of the northern Midland Basin acreage position, (ii) expiration of non-prospective acreage in the Delaware Basin area and (iii) abandonment of non-core prospects in the New Mexico Shelf and Texas Permian areas. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded approximately $12.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our New Mexico Shelf area. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 755,952 $ 22.48 $ 561,291 $ 20.07 Depreciation of other property and equipment 15,195 0.45 12,376 0.44 Amortization of intangible asset - operating rights 1,461 0.04 1,461 0.05 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 772,608 $ 22.97 $ 575,128 $ 20.56 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 93.42 $ 91.21 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 3.67 $ 2.76 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $756.0 million ($22.48 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $194.7 million (35 percent) from $561.3 million ($20.07 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) increased production associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2012 and 2013, (ii) increased production associated with our acquisitions in 2012 and (iii) higher depletion rates. The increase in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due (i) drilling deeper, higher-cost wells in less proven areas and (ii) increasing production in our newer asset areas, such as the Delaware Basin, where we have a higher depletion rate than our legacy assets, such as the New Mexico Shelf. More of our drilling capital is spent drilling higher-cost horizontal wells, much of which is in areas that have not had significant drilling activity or historically been developed vertically. Generally, when transitioning to a horizontal program, (i) well costs are higher as efficiencies from optimization of drilling and completion methodologies have yet to be realized and (ii) our ability to record proved reserves is limited under the rules associated with recognizing proved reserves, in part due to the limited amount of horizontal wells in the area and the lack of historical well production performance. As a result of these factors, the change in our production amongst our assets, discussed above, and our significant horizontal drilling activities in the Delaware Basin, we have seen increases in our overall depletion rate over the past year to $22.48 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $ 20.07 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2012. 61 The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with our increase in depreciation of other property and equipment related to buildings and other items as a result of our increased number of employees. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to a decrease in our estimated future cash flows related to management outlook of future commodity prices and costs, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $65.4 million during the second quarter of 2013, which was primarily attributable to non-core natural gas related properties in our New Mexico Shelf area. We did not recognize any impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2012. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 153,199 $ 4.55 $ 118,256 $ 4.23 Non-cash stock-based compensation 35,078 1.04 29,872 1.07 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (18,462) (0.55) (14,332) (0.51) Total general and administrative expenses $ 169,815 $ 5.04 $ 133,796 $ 4.79 General and administrative expenses were approximately $169.8 million ($5.04 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $36.0 million (27 percent) from $133.8 million ($4.79 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase in general and administrative expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to (a) a charge in 2013 to adjust our bonus accrual for services related to 2012 of approximately $5.2 million and (b) an increase in salary and the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities of approximately $30.1 million, which includes a $7.5 million increase related to non-cash stock-based compensation, both from (i) increased drilling and exploration activities and (ii) our acquisitions in 2012; partially offset by an approximate $2.3 million net benefit to stock-based compensation related to forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards associated with two of our former officers in 2013. Additionally, the increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements of $4.1 million, which is due to more wells operated as a result of continued drilling activity, offset overall general and administrative expenses. The increase in overall general and administrative expenses per Boe of $0.25 was primarily due to the factors discussed above, partially offset by (i) increased production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2012 and 2013, (ii) increased production from our acquisitions in 2012 and (iii) increased third-party operating fee reimbursements. As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $18.5 million and $14.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements was primarily comprised of approximately $1.3 million attributable to the wells acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition, with the remaining increase primarily due to increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated as a result of continued drilling activity period over period . 62 (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 Gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ (133,890) $ 127,293 Natural gas derivatives 10,238 150 Total $ (123,652) $ 127,443 The following table represents the Company's cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 Cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ (41,616) $ 22,411 Natural gas derivatives 9,275 1,125 Total $ (32,341) $ 23,536 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which can be volatile. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, and to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2013 2012 Interest expense $ 218,581 $ 182,705 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility 2.3% 2.3% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes 6.1% 6.6% Total weighted average interest rate 5.7% 5.6% Weighted average credit facility balance $ 327,488 $ 694,984 Weighted average senior notes balance 3,117,222 2,238,611 Total weighted average debt balance $ 3,444,710 $ 2,933,595 The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012 was due primarily to (i) borrowings associated with our acquisitions in 2012 partially offset by our asset divestiture in late 2012 and (ii) capital expenditures in excess of our cash flows. The increase in interest expense was due to an overall increase in the weighted average balance of debt and a slightly increased weighted average interest rate due to a higher percentage of our debt outstanding as senior notes which carry a higher interest rate than our credit facility. 63 Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax expense of $118.2 million and $251.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was 33.1 percent and 38.1 percent, respectively. We recorded a $21.9 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to a decrease in our estimated overall state tax rate utilized to record our net deferred tax liability. During 2013, the state of New Mexico passed legislation to phase in a tax rate reduction over the next five years from 7.6 percent in 2013 to 5.9 percent in 2018. Additionally, we continuously evaluate the state apportionment, and based on our current forecast, along with the New Mexico rate declines, we have revised our state rate. Excluding the effect of the New Mexico state rate reduction, our effective rate would have been 39.2 percent in 2013, which would approximate a more normalized effective income tax rate. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. In December 2012, we closed the sale of certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million , which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million . As a result of post-closing adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2013, we made a positive adjustment to gain (loss) on disposition of assets of approximately $19.6 million. We recognized income from discontinued operations of $12.1 million and $23.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The results of operations of these assets are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and are described in more detail in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 64 Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 totaled $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion respectively. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow expenditures is the timing of payments. The 2014 expenditures were funded in part from borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from our May 2014 equity offering. Delaware Basin midstream agreements . On May 9, 2014, we signed an agreement with an unrelated third party to own 50 percent of a new midstream joint venture. The joint venture was formed to build a crude oil pipeline to gather and transport production in the northern Delaware Basin. We expect the system to be operational in the second half of 2015. We invested $30.1 million in 2014. Additionally, on May 9, 2014, we entered into a ten year crude petroleum dedication and transportation agreement with the joint venture. Under the terms of the agreement and subject to certain regulatory approvals, we are obligated to deliver oil production to the joint venture from a substantial portion of the properties that we currently operate in the northern Delaware Basin area, as well as oil production from future development of certain of our northern Delaware Basin acreage. 2015 capital budget . In January 2015, we announced our updated 2015 capital budget of approximately $2.0 billion, of which approximately 90 percent of the drilling and completion costs will be dedicated to horizontal drilling. Our 2015 capital program is expected to continue focusing on drilling in the Delaware Basin. The 2015 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and cost, will exceed our cash flow. We expect our cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital expenditure needs during 2015. However, if we experience sustained commodity prices lower than our forecasted pricing without sufficient costs reductions, we may adjust our capital budget to preserve our financial strength. During 2015, we plan to use our credit facility and may use other financing sources to fund such expenditures in excess of our cash flows. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the costs of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, technological and competitive developments and market conditions. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may consider increasing, decreasing or reallocating our capital spending plans. Other than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise. 65 Acquisitions. The following table reflects o ur expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 Property acquisition costs: Proved $ 99,362 $ 11,499 $ 857,836 Unproved (a) 292,363 85,538 441,042 Total property acquisition costs $ 391,725 $ 97,037 $ 1,298,878 (a) Included in the unproved property acquisition costs above are budgeted leasehold acreage acquisitions of $89.1 million, $67.6 million and $36.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Divestitures. In December 2012, we closed the sale of certain non-core assets, a portion of which were acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition, for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million (included in discontinued operations). For the year ended December 31, 2012 these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day. We estimate that the proved reserves of these assets at closing were approximately 35.3 MMBoe. We used the net proceeds from this divestiture to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. Contractual obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2014 : Payments Due by Period Less than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than (in thousands) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long-term debt (a) $ 3,489,500 $ - $ - $ 139,500 $ 3,350,000 Cash interest expense on debt (b) 1,569,281 271,297 404,066 402,267 491,651 Asset retirement obligations (c) 119,881 9,146 14,045 4,497 92,193 Employment agreements with officers (d) 7,385 7,385 - - - Purchase obligations (e) 167,174 57,489 45,097 28,683 35,905 Operating lease obligations (f) 36,215 7,245 11,166 8,899 8,905 Total contractual obligations $ 5,389,436 $ 352,562 $ 474,374 $ 583,846 $ 3,978,654 (a) See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding future interest payment obligations on our long-term debt. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (b) Cash interest expense on our senior notes is estimated assuming no principal repayment until their maturity dates. Cash interest expense on our credit facility is estimated assuming (i) a principal balance outstanding equal to the balance at December 31, 2014 of $139.5 million with no principal repayment until the instrument due date of May 9, 2019 and (ii) a fixed interest rate of 2.0 percent, which was our interest rate at December 31, 2014. Also included in the Less than 1 year column is accrued interest at December 31, 2014 of approximately $69.3 million. (c) Amounts represent costs related to expected oil and natural gas property abandonments related to proved reserves by period, net of any future accretion. (d) Represents amounts of cash compensation we are obligated to pay to our officers under employment agreements assuming such employees continue to serve the entire term of their employment agreement and their cash compensation is not adjusted. 66 (e) Relates to purchase agreements we have entered into including daywork drilling contracts, water commitment agreements, throughput volume delivery commitments and power commitments. (f) We lease vehicles, equipment and office facilities under non-cancellable operating leases. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities (including the cash settlements received from (paid on) derivatives not designated as hedges presented in our investing activities) and borrowings under our credit facility. Based on current commodity prices and capital costs, we believe our 2015 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, will exceed our cash flow, and we plan to fund the difference with borrowings under our credit facility or we may use other financing sources. We believe that we have adequate availability under our credit facility to fund any cash flow deficits, though we could reduce our capital spending program to remain substantially within our cash flow. The following table summarizes our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,673,787 $ 1,362,020 $ 1,237,478 Net cash used in investing activities (2,545,996) (1,896,794) (2,240,444) Net cash provided by financing activities 872,209 531,915 1,005,504 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ - $ (2,859) $ 2,538 Cash flow from operating activities. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to (i) an increase in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $340.2 million and (ii) approximately $43.5 million of negative variances in operating assets and liabilities compared to $83.6 million of negative variances in operating assets and liabilities in 2013, partially offset by cash increases in oil and natural gas production costs of approximately $ 82.9 million. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to increases in our oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $500.1 million; partially offset by (i) cash increases in oil and natural gas production costs of approximately $111.7 million, (ii) cash increases in general and administration expense and interest expense of approximately $30.8 million and $36.4 million, respectively, and (iii) approximately $83.6 million of negative variances in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we invested $2.6 billion, $1.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, for capital expenditures on oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow expenditures is the timing of payments. The 2014, 2013 and 2012 expenditures were funded in part from borrowings under our credit facility and our equity offering in 2014. Cash flows used in investing activities were increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to (i) the increase in amounts invested in oil and natural gas properties during 2014 and 2013 discussed above, (ii) contributions to our equity method investment of $30.1 million during 2014 and (iii) $15.2 million of proceeds from the dispositions of assets during 2013 compared to $1.3 million of proceeds from the dispositions of assets during 2014, partially offset by $72.0 million of receipts from derivatives not designated as hedges during 2014 compared to payments of $32.3 million during 2013. Cash flows used in investing activities were lower during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to our Three Rivers Acquisition in 2012 partially offset by (i) an increase in our exploration and development expenditures in 2013 and (ii) a $477.3 million decrease in proceeds from the disposition of assets related to the divestiture of non-core assets in 2012. 67 Cash flow from financing activities. Below is a description of our financing activities. During 2014, 2013 and 2012 we completed the following significant capital markets activities: In May 2014, we issued in a secondary public offering 7.5 million shares of our common stock at $129.00 per share, and we received net proceeds of approximately $932.0 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and used the remainder for general corporate purposes, including funding our drilling program and capital commitments associated with the midstream joint venture. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our debt balance at December 31, 2014. In June 2013, we issued $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2023 at 103.75 percent of par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $867.8 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the tender offer and redemption of the 8.625% Notes at a price of 106.922 percent of the unpaid principal amount. The remaining proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding on the credit facility. In August 2012, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2023 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $688.6 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. In March 2012, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2022 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $590.0 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. Our credit facility has a maturity date of May 9, 2019. Our borrowing base is $3.25 billion until the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination in May 2015, and commitments from our bank group total $2.5 billion. Between scheduled borrowing base redeterminations, the Company and the lenders (requiring a 66 2/3 percent vote), may each request one special redetermination. At December 31, 2014 we had unused commitments of approximately $2.4 billion based on bank commitments of $2.5 billion . Based on our current ratio as defined in our credit facility as part of our financial covenants, at December 31, 2014 , our additional borrowings would be limited to approximately $1.6 billion. Advances on our credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (i) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank ( JPM Prime Rate ) (3.25 percent at December 31, 2014 ) or (ii) a Eurodollar rate (substantially equal to the LIBOR). The credit facility interest rates of Eurodollar rate advances and JPM Prime Rate advances varied, with interest margins ranging from 125 to 225 basis points and 25 to 125 basis points, respectively, per annum depending on the debt balance outstanding on our credit facility. Under our current credit facility, we pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment ranging from 30 to 37.5 basis points per annum, depending on utilization of the borrowing base. In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. Over the last three years, we have demonstrated our use of capital markets by issuing senior unsecured debt and common stock. There are no assurances that we can access capital markets to obtain additional funding, if needed, and at what cost and terms. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in oil and natural gas companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our credit facility. Liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $21,000 of cash on hand. At December 31, 2014 , the commitments under our credit facility were $2.5 billion, which provided us with approximately $2.4 billion of unused commitments . Based on our current ratio as defined in our credit facility as part of our financial covenants, at December 31, 2014, our additional borrowings would be limited to approximately $1.6 billion. Upon a redetermination, our $3.25 billion borrowing base could be substantially reduced. There is no assurance that our borrowing base will not be reduced, which could affect our liquidity. Debt ratings . We receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor Ratings Group, Inc. ( S&P ) and Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P corporate rating for us is BB+ with a stable 68 outlook. Moody corporate rating for us is Ba2 with a positive outlook. S&P and Moody consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Book capitalization and current ratio . Our book capitalization at December 31, 2014 was $8.8 billion, consisting of debt of $ 3.5 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 5.3 billion. Our debt to book capitalization was 40 percent and 49 percent at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.83 to 1.0 at December 31, 2014 as compared to 0.69 to 1.0 at December 31, 2013. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets, and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that we are unable to control or predict. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received from continuing operations an average of $83.17 per barrel of oil and $5.39 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $91.76 and $87.96 per barrel of oil and $5.08 and $5.06 per Mcf of natural gas in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. Historically, higher oil prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, escalated costs. These cost trends put pressure not only on our operating costs, but also on capital costs. 69 Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of business combinations, valuation of financial derivative instruments and income taxes. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under this method, exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing properties are sold. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties or projects are periodically assessed for impairment of value by considering future drilling plans, the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of two to 31 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. 70 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Future Cash Flows This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2014, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with SEC guidelines. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2014 was based on an unweighted average twelve month WTI posted price of $91.48 per Bbl for oil and a Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future net cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this report as of December 31, 2014 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2014 Standardized Measure on a 12-month average of commodity prices on the first day of the month and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. Our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase, reducing future earnings. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our proved properties for impairment. Asset Retirement Obligations There are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and, generally, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. When the judgments used to estimate the initial fair value of the asset retirement obligation change, an adjustment is recorded to both the obligation and the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than management estimates of its future net cash flows, including cash flows from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves. If the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions in estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with GAAP, we calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation using various valuation methods. The valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value. We utilize (a) the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, (b) the average of the high and low stock price 71 on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and (c) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. The significant assumptions used in these models include expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, forfeiture rate, and the probability of meeting performance targets. Each of these valuation methods were chosen as management believes they give the best estimate of fair value for the respective stock-based awards. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding our stock-based compensation. Valuation of Business Combinations In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must record assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we utilize estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. We make future price assumptions to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows were discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rates determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rates are subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future net cash flows of the unproved reserves were reduced by additional risk-weighting factors. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in a higher depletion expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Valuation of Financial Derivative Instruments In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. In addition, we have used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price-sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties creditworthiness. All derivative instruments are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $752.7 million at December 31, 2014. In order to determine the fair value at the end of each reporting period, we compute discounted cash flows for the duration of each commodity derivative instrument using the terms of the related contract. Inputs consist of published forward commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate. We compare these prices to the price parameters contained in our hedge contracts to determine estimated future cash inflows or outflows. We then discount the cash inflows or outflows using a combination of published LIBOR rates and Eurodollar futures rates. The fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities include a measure of credit risk based on average published yields by credit rating. In addition, for collars, we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility, market prices and contract parameters. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported a $890.9 million gain on commodity derivative instruments. We compare our estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments with those provided by our counterparties. There have been no significant differences. 72 Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes in jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our overall tax rate using a combination of the federal tax rate and a blend of enacted state tax rates. Acquisitions or dispositions of assets could change the apportionment of our state taxes, which would impact our overall tax rate. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, which are based on numerous judgments and assumptions inherent in the determination of future taxable income, at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes and tax credits. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our income tax returns. Material changes to our tax accruals may occur in the future based on audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. An entity is required to apply ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (Topics 205 and 360), that raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Under the revised standard, a discontinued operation is (i) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of by sale, disposed of other than by sale or is classified as held for sale that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity operations and financial results or (ii) an acquired business or nonprofit activity that is classified as held for sale on the date of the acquisition. This update is aimed at reducing the frequency of disposals reported as discontinued operations by focusing on strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity operations and financial results. An entity is required to apply ASU 2014-08 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those annual periods, though earlier adoption is permitted. An entity should provide the disclosures required by this amendment prospectively. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 73
