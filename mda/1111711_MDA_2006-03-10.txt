ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) of the terms of its agreement with BP oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Under the revised agreement, Whiting Clean Energy will continue to meet BP need for steam, while reducing the power plant required run time for the next three years. In the first quarter of 2005, Northern Indiana selected TPC from bidders responding to a Request for Proposals issued in October 2004 to provide, pending regulatory approval, 230 mw of intermediate dispatchable power, utilizing the generation facilities of Whiting Clean Energy. Whiting Clean Energy has filed and the FERC accepted a tariff covering the sale of such intermediate dispatchable power. On April 11, 2005, Whiting Clean Energy, TPC and Northern Indiana, each a subsidiary of NiSource, filed their petition (cause 42824) with the IURC for approval of a three-year arrangement pursuant to which Whiting Clean Energy would sell to TPC electric power generated at Whiting Clean Energy generating facility in Whiting, Indiana which power would then be sold by TPC to Northern Indiana. On July 1, 2005, the IURC issued an interim order approving the sales of the necessary capacity and energy produced by the Whiting Clean Energy Facility to Northern Indiana through TPC under the Power Sales Tariff on an interim basis until December 31, 2005, or until a subsequent order is issued by the IURC, and authorized Northern Indiana recovery of fuel costs associated with interim purchases made under the Power Sales Tariff as part of its normal FAC proceedings. On July 21, 2005, Intervenor LaPorte County filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the interim order with the IURC. On August 31, 2005, the IURC denied LaPorte County Petition for Reconsideration. On September 29, 2005, LaPorte County filed its Notice of Appeal of the IURC Order of August 31, 2005 denying its Petition for Reconsideration. Northern Indiana filed supplemental testimony on January 26, 2006 indicating that it no longer is seeking approval of the three-year arrangement. The testimony clarifies that Northern Indiana is seeking affirmation from the IURC that the intermediate dispatchable power purchases made between August 9, 2005 and December 31, 2005 which were made pursuant to the July 1, 2005 interim order were reasonable. The evidentiary hearing and final order are expected in the second quarter of 2006.
