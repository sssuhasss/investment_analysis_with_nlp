ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors ). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and investigational drug candidate, we strive to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world. We have operations in more than 30 countries worldwide, with headquarters in Foster City, California. Gilead primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, hematology/oncology, cardiovascular and inflammation/respiratory diseases. We seek to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through product acquisition and in-licensing strategies. Our portfolio of marketed products includes AmBisome , Atripla , Cayston , Complera /Eviplera , Descovy , Emtriva , Epclusa , Genvoya , Harvoni , Hepsera , Letairis , Odefsey , Ranexa , Sovaldi , Stribild , Truvada , Tybost , Vemlidy , Viread , Vitekta , and Zydelig . We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in over 30 countries. We also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. 2016 Business Highlights During 2016 , we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical need. Highlights of our 2016 activities include: Submission of marketing authorization applications for the once-daily, single-tablet regimen of sofosbuvir 400 mg, velpatasvir 100 mg and voxilaprevir 100 mg for the treatment of HCV-infected patients to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission. FDA and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approval of Vemlidy, a once-daily treatment for adults with HBV infection with compensated liver disease. European Commission approval of marketing authorization for once-daily Truvada in combination with safer-sex practices to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection among uninfected adults at high risk, a strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. FDA and European Commission approval of Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. FDA and the European Commission approval of two tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based regimens, Odefsey and Descovy, a fixed-dose combination for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc. (Nimbus), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nimbus Therapeutics, and its Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor program. The Nimbus program includes the lead candidate NDI-010976, an ACC inhibitor, and other pre-clinical ACC inhibitors for the potential treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatocellular carcinoma and other diseases. Closed on a license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos NV (Galapagos), a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in Belgium, for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a JAK1-selective inhibitor being investigated for inflammatory disease indications. 2016 Financial Highlights During 2016 , total revenues decreased to $30.4 billion and total product sales decreased to $30.0 billion , compared to $32.6 billion and $32.2 billion in 2015 , respectively, primarily due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi, partially offset by sales of Epclusa and TAF-based products, Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. In the United States, product sales were $19.3 billion in 2016 , compared to $21.2 billion in 2015 . In Europe, product sales were $6.1 billion in 2016 , compared to $7.2 billion in 2015 . In Japan, product sales were $2.5 billion , compared to $1.9 billion in 2015 . Sales in other international locations were $2.1 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.9 billion in 2015 . 47 Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 69% to $5.1 billion for 2016 compared to 2015 , primarily due to the overall progression of clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments, our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher, up-front collaboration expenses related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos and our purchase of Nimbus. In addition, we recorded in-process R&D (IPR&D) impairment charges related to momelotinib and simtuzumab. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $3.4 billion for 2016 and 2015 . Declines in our branded prescription drug (BPD) fee expense were offset by higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. Net income attributable to Gilead for 2016 was $13.5 billion or $9.94 per diluted share, compared to $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share in 2015 , primarily due to lower product sales and higher R&D expenses. Year-over-year earnings per share were favorably impacted by our share repurchase activities. During 2016, we repurchased a total of 123 million shares for $11.0 billion, of which 54 million shares or $5.0 billion were repurchased under an accelerated stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2016 , we had $32.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared to $26.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 . This increase was primarily due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in September 2016 (the 2016 Notes). During 2016, we generated $16.7 billion in operating cash flow, utilized $11.0 billion to repurchase stock and paid cash dividends of $2.5 billion . Outlook 2017 In 2017, we will continue to maintain our strong operating and financial discipline. From a R&D perspective, we will continue to invest in conducting new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. We expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates, including progress of our Phase 3 studies of selonsertib for NASH. In order to further develop our product pipeline, we will focus on leveraging our capital to pursue external licensing and acquisition opportunities which fit into our long-term strategic plan. From a commercial perspective, we will continue to focus on supporting the uptake of our recently launched TAF-based regimens and continue to promote the use of our existing commercial products. We also hired a field-based team to promote Truvada for PrEP as we believe it will continue to be an integral part of our growth in HIV in the United States as communities embrace the public health benefits of prevention. In HCV, it is very difficult for us to accurately predict our revenue because HCV is a cure market. We expect patient starts to decline relative to 2016 in all major markets, and this will be the primary driver of our expected decline in total product sales. We also expect product sales to be impacted by the effects of competition on market share and net price, as well as a continued decrease in the average duration of treatment as fewer patients are treated for 24 or 12 weeks and more patients are treated for 8 weeks. While we anticipate HCV revenues in 2017 to decline from prior year levels, there are still many patients to treat and we expect our HCV products to generate significant revenues and cash flows in the future. We will continue to focus on helping HCV patients get diagnosed and into treater care. In addition, we will continue to invest strategically and selectively in educational programs that raise awareness and access to our medications. We will continue to focus on ensuring patient access to our products around the world. Our progress on all of these initiatives is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Truvada outside the United States and Viread later in 2017; inaccuracies in our HCV patient start estimates; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. 48 2016 Results of Operations Total Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Revenues: Product sales $ 29,953 (7 )% $ 32,151 31 % $ 24,474 Royalty, contract and other revenues 437 (10 )% 488 17 % 416 Total revenues $ 30,390 (7 )% $ 32,639 31 % $ 24,890 Product Sales 2016 Compared to 2015 Total product sales were $30.0 billion in 2016 , compared to $32.2 billion in 2015 , primarily due to a decrease in antiviral product sales. Antiviral product sales, which include sales of our HIV and other antiviral products and our HCV products, were $27.7 billion in 2016 , compared to $30.2 billion in 2015 . HIV and other antiviral product sales were $12.9 billion in 2016 , compared to $11.1 billion in 2015 . The increase was primarily driven by the continued uptake of our TAF-based products, Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey, partially offset by decreases in sales of tenofovir disoproxil (TDF)-based products. HCV product sales, which consist of Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, were $14.8 billion in 2016 , compared to $19.1 billion in 2015 . The declines were due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi, partially offset by sales of Epclusa, which was launched in 2016 across various locations. Other product sales, which include sales of Letairis, Ranexa and AmBisome, were $2.2 billion in 2016 , an increase of 14% compared to $1.9 billion in 2015 . Of our product sales in 2016 , 36% were generated outside the United States. We faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro and Yen. We used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $498 million on our 2016 product sales compared to 2015 . We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, including rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. These deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $20.3 billion or 40% of gross product sales in 2016 , compared to $18.1 billion or 36% in 2015 . Of the $20.3 billion in 2016 , $19.1 billion or 38% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.2 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. The increase in our 2016 gross-to-net deductions was primarily due to an increase in discounts and a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments for our HCV products in the United States. Product sales in the United States decreased by 9% to $19.3 billion in 2016 , compared to $21.2 billion in 2015 . Declines in sales of our HCV products were partially offset by increases in sales of our HIV and other antiviral products. The increases in the sales of our HIV and other antiviral products were primarily driven by sales of our newly launched TAF-based products and a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $332 million, primarily related to our TDF-based products. Product sales in Europe decreased by 15% to $6.1 billion in 2016 , compared to $7.2 billion in 2015 , primarily due to lower Harvoni and Sovaldi sales volume. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $503 million on our product sales in 2016 compared to 2015 . Product sales in Japan, which consist of Sovaldi and Harvoni, increased by 31% to $2.5 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.9 billion in 2015 . The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volume of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% for Sovaldi and Harvoni that was effective April 1, 2016. Product sales in other international locations increased by 10% to $2.1 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.9 billion in 2015 , primarily driven by continued launches of our HCV and TAF-based products across various locations. 2015 Compared to 2014 Total product sales were $32.2 billion in 2015 , compared to $24.5 billion in 2014 , primarily driven by an increase in antiviral product sales. 49 Antiviral product sales were $30.2 billion in 2015, compared to $22.8 billion in 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the launch of Harvoni across various geographies, partially offset by a decline in Sovaldi sales with patients being prescribed Harvoni instead of Sovaldi. HIV products also contributed to the sales increases primarily due to increased sales of our newer HIV single-tablet regimens, Stribild, Complera/Eviplera and Genvoya, partially offset by declines in Atripla sales volumes. Other product sales, which include sales of Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig, were $1.9 billion in 2015 , an increase of 16% compared to $1.7 billion in 2014 . Of our product sales in 2015, 34% were generated outside the United States. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $737 million on our 2015 product sales compared to 2014 . Our gross-to-net deductions totaled $18.1 billion or 36% in 2015 , compared to $7.3 billion or 23% in 2014 . Of the $18.1 billion in 2015, $16.4 billion or 33% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. Our 2015 gross-to-net deductions attributable to our HCV product sales exceeded our overall gross-to-net of 36% in order to obtain formulary status or expand access for patients. Product sales in the United States increased by 17% to $21.2 billion in 2015 , compared to $18.1 billion in 2014 , primarily due to sales of Harvoni and increases in sales of Stribild, Truvada and Complera, partially offset by declines in sales of Sovaldi. Product sales in Europe increased by 39% to $7.2 billion in 2015 , compared to $5.1 billion in 2014 , primarily due to sales of Harvoni. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $611 million on our product sales in 2015 compared to 2014 . Product sales in other international locations increased to $3.8 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to the launch in Japan of Sovaldi in May 2015 and Harvoni in September 2015. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Antiviral products: HCV products Harvoni $ 9,081 (34 )% $ 13,864 * $ 2,127 Sovaldi 4,001 (24 )% 5,276 (49 )% 10,283 Epclusa 1,752 * * HIV and other antiviral products Truvada 3,566 3 % 3,459 4 % 3,340 Atripla 2,605 (17 )% 3,134 (10 )% 3,470 Stribild 1,914 5 % 1,825 52 % 1,197 Genvoya 1,484 * 45 * Complera/Eviplera 1,457 2 % 1,427 16 % 1,228 Viread 1,186 7 % 1,108 5 % 1,058 Odefsey 329 * * Descovy 298 * * Other antiviral 72 4 % 69 (22 )% 88 Total antiviral products 27,745 (8 )% 30,207 33 % 22,791 Other products: Letairis 819 17 % 700 18 % 595 Ranexa 677 15 % 588 15 % 510 AmBisome 356 2 % 350 (10 )% 388 Zydelig 168 27 % 132 * 23 Other 188 8 % 174 4 % 167 Total product sales $ 29,953 (7 )% $ 32,151 31 % $ 24,474 _______________________ * Percentage not meaningful 50 The following is additional discussion of our results by product: Harvoni Harvoni was approved by FDA in October 2014, by the European Commission in November 2014 and by the Japanese MHLW in July 2015. Harvoni sales accounted for 33% , 46% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In 2016 , product sales were $4.9 billion in the United States, $1.8 billion in Europe, $1.8 billion in Japan and $491 million in other international locations. In 2015 , product sales were $10.1 billion in the United States, $2.2 billion in Europe, $1.0 billion in Japan and $545 million in other international locations. In 2014 , product sales were $2.0 billion in the United States and $103 million in Europe. In the United States, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and a lower average net selling price, which was partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $181 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. The number of patients that started treatment with Harvoni in the United States peaked in the first half of 2015, as many warehoused patients initiated treatment after the product launch. In Europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, net of hedges. In Japan, the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective April 1, 2016. In other international locations, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a lower average net selling price, partially offset by the continued launches of Harvoni across various locations. The increase in product sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the launch of Harvoni in the United States, Europe and Japan. Sovaldi Sovaldi was approved by FDA in December 2013, by the European Commission in January 2014 and by the Japanese MHLW in March 2015. Sovaldi sales accounted for 14% , 17% and 45% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In 2016 , product sales were $1.9 billion in the United States, $891 million in Europe, $635 million in Japan and $580 million in other international locations. In 2015 , product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $1.6 billion in Europe, $878 million in Japan and $409 million in other international locations. In 2014 , product sales were $8.5 billion in the United States, $1.5 billion in Europe and $230 million in other international locations. In the United States, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $98 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. In Europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume. In Japan, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective April 1, 2016 and lower sales volume. In other international locations, the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales volume. The decrease in product sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to volume declines in the United States with patients being prescribed Harvoni instead of Sovaldi, partially offset by volume increases in Japan and Europe due to the launch of Sovaldi. Epclusa Epclusa was launched in the United States and Europe in June and July 2016, respectively, and accounted for 6% of our total antiviral product sales. In 2016 , product sales were $1.8 billion , primarily driven by sales in the United States of $1.6 billion . Truvada Truvada sales accounted for 13% , 11% and 15% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In 2016 , product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $913 million in Europe and $269 million in other international locations. In 2015 , product sales were $2.1 billion in the United States, $1.1 billion in Europe and $284 million in other international locations. In 2014 , product sales were $1.8 billion in the United States, $1.3 billion in Europe and $278 million in other international locations. Truvada sales increased by 3% to $3.6 billion in 2016 , compared to $3.5 billion in 2015 , primarily due to a higher average net selling price and higher sales volume in the United States, as a result of the increased usage of Truvada for PrEP. Truvada sales increased by 4% in 2015 , compared to $3.3 billion in 2014 , primarily due to sales volume growth and an increase in the average net selling price in the United States. 51 Atripla Atripla sales accounted for 9% , 10% and 15% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In 2016 , product sales were $1.9 billion in the United States, $520 million in Europe and $187 million in other international locations. In 2015 , product sales were $2.2 billion in the United States, $694 million in Europe and $218 million in other international locations. In 2014 , product sales were $2.4 billion in the United States, $888 million in Europe and $225 million in other international locations. Atripla sales decreased by 17% to $2.6 billion in 2016 , compared to $3.1 billion in 2015 and by 10% in 2015 , compared to $3.5 billion in 2014 , primarily due to declines in sales volume as doctors prescribed newer regimens, including TDF- and TAF-based regimens. The efavirenz component of Atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $966 million , $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion of our Atripla sales in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. A generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Sustiva (efavirenz) was made available in Canada and Europe in 2013 and will be made available in the United States in 2017. While we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our Atripla sales, we have not yet observed any meaningful splitting of the Atripla single-tablet regimen. Stribild Stribild sales accounted for 7% , 6% and 5% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In 2016 , product sales were $1.5 billion in the United States and $314 million in Europe. In 2015 , product sales were $1.5 billion in the United States and $282 million in Europe. In 2014 , product sales were $1.0 billion in the United States and $145 million in Europe. Stribild sales increased by 5% to $1.9 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.8 billion in 2015 , primarily due to a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $223 million during the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower sales volume as a result of the continued launch of our new TAF-based product, Genvoya. Stribild sales increased by 52% in 2015 , compared to $1.2 billion in 2014 , primarily due to higher sales volume in the United States and Europe. TAF-based regimens - Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey Genvoya was launched in the United States and Europe in November 2015. Descovy was launched in the United States and Europe in April 2016. Odefsey was launched in the United States in March 2016 and launched in Europe in July 2016. Our newly launched TAF-based regimens accounted for 8% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016 . In 2016 , product sales of our TAF-based regimens were $2.1 billion , primarily driven by sales in the United States of $1.8 billion . Complera/Eviplera Complera/Eviplera sales accounted for 5% of our total antiviral product sales for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . In 2016 , product sales were $821 million in the United States and $580 million in Europe. In 2015 , product sales were $796 million in the United States and $576 million in Europe. In 2014 , product sales were $663 million in the United States and $513 million in Europe. Complera/Eviplera sales increased by 2% to $1.5 billion in 2016 , compared to $1.4 billion in 2015 , primarily due to a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $89 million during the third quarter of 2016. Complera/Eviplera increased by 16% in 2015 , compared to $1.2 billion in 2014 , driven primarily by higher sales volume in the United States and Europe. Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Royalty, contract and other revenues $ 437 (10 )% $ 488 17 % $ 416 Royalty, contract and other revenues declined by 10% to $437 million in 2016, compared to $488 million in 2015 and increased by 17% in 2015, compared to $416 million in 2014. The changes were primarily due to royalty revenues from F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd for sales of Tamiflu. The majority of our royalties are recognized in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding product sales occur. 52 Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Total product sales $ 29,953 (7 )% $ 32,151 31 % $ 24,474 Cost of goods sold $ 4,261 6 % $ 4,006 6 % $ 3,788 Product gross margin 86 % 88 % 85 % Our product gross margin for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to changes in product mix, as our HCV product sales decreased as a percentage of total product sales. Our product gross margin for 2015 increased compared to 2014 primarily due to changes in product mix, as Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz component at a gross margin of zero, declined and HCV product sales increased as a percentage of total product sales. Research and Development Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in R&D expenses: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 R&D expenses $ 5,098 69 % $ 3,014 6 % $ 2,854 R&D expenses summarized above consisted primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, up-front payments under collaboration agreements, milestone payments, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. However, we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 2015 2014 Clinical studies and outside services $ 3,219 $ 1,634 $ 1,688 Personnel and infrastructure expenses 1,122 1,041 900 Facilities, IT and other costs 325 339 266 IPR&D impairment charges 432 Total $ 5,098 $ 3,014 $ 2,854 In 2016 , R&D expenses increased $2.1 billion or 69% , compared to 2015 , primarily due to increases in clinical studies and outside services expenses of $1.6 billion. The increases in clinical studies and outside services were primarily due to the overall progression of clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments, our purchase of an FDA priority review voucher, up-front collaboration expenses related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos and our purchase of Nimbus. IPR&D impairment charges were a result of termination of clinical developments for momelotinib and simtuzumab. In 2015 , R&D expenses increased $160 million or 6% , compared to 2014 , primarily due to increase s in personnel and infrastructure expenses of $141 million and facilities, IT and other costs of $73 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity and geographic expansion. In 2014 , clinical studies and outside services included expenses of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in SG&A expenses: (In millions, except percentages) 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 SG&A expenses $ 3,398 (1 )% $ 3,426 15 % $ 2,983 53 SG&A expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. Expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses also include the BPD fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of an industry fee (the BPD fee), which is estimated based on select government sales during each calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales and is trued-up upon receipt of invoices from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The amount of the annual BPD fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole was $3.0 billion in 2016 and will increase to $4.0 billion in 2017. In 2016 , SG&A expenses were flat compared to 2015. Declines in our BPD fee were offset by higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. The 2016 BPD fee was favorably impacted by a credit of $191 million based on receipt of the IRS invoice. In 2015 , SG&A expenses increased $443 million or 15% compared to 2014 , primarily due to an increase of $627 million in headcount-related, marketing and other expenses to support the growth and geographic expansion of our business, partially offset by a decrease in BPD fee of $100 million based on receipt of the IRS invoice. Our BPD fee expenses were $270 million in 2016 , $414 million in 2015 and $590 million in 2014 . The BPD fee is not tax deductible. Interest Expense In 2016 , interest expense increased to $964 million , compared to $688 million in 2015 , primarily due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes and $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the 2015 Notes). In 2015 , interest expense increased to $688 million , compared to $412 million in 2014 , primarily due to the issuance of the 2015 Notes and the issuance of $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in 2014. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $428 million , $154 million and $3 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, primarily due to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities earning a higher yield. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $3.6 billion , $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The effective tax rate of 21.1%, 16.4% and 18.8% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States and where the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and working capital (in millions): December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 32,380 $ 26,208 $ 11,726 Working capital $ 11,226 $ 14,872 $ 11,953 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $32.4 billion at December 31, 2016 , an increase of $6.2 billion or 24% when compared to $26.2 billion at December 31, 2015 . During 2016, we generated $16.7 billion in operating cash flow, received $4.9 billion in net proceeds from the 2016 Notes, utilized $11.0 billion to repurchase stock, repaid $985 million principal balance of our senior notes and convertible senior notes and paid cash dividends of $2.5 billion . Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.2 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $14.5 billion or 124% when compared to $11.7 billion at December 31, 2014. During 2015, we generated $20.3 billion in operating cash flow, received $9.9 billion in net proceeds from our issuance of senior unsecured notes, utilized $10.0 billion to repurchase stock, utilized $3.9 billion to settle 46 million warrants related to the convertible senior notes due in May 2016 (the Convertible Notes) and paid cash dividends of $1.9 billion. 54 Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016 , approximately $27.4 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. We do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs. Working Capital Working capital was $11.2 billion at December 31, 2016 . The decrease of $3.6 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decline in cash and cash equivalents, as a result of an increase in our long-term marketable securities. Working capital was $14.9 billion at December 31, 2015 . The increase of $2.9 billion from working capital as of December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accrued government and other rebates. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 16,669 $ 20,329 $ 12,818 Investing activities $ (11,985 ) $ (12,475 ) $ (1,823 ) Financing activities $ (9,347 ) $ (4,963 ) $ (3,025 ) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.7 billion to $16.7 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher cash payments related to accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks. Cash flows from operations may decrease in the future as our HCV product sales are expected to decline. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $7.5 billion to $20.3 billion in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher cash receipts as a result of higher product sales. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities primarily consists of net purchases of marketable securities and other investments and our capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $490 million to $12.0 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by other investments related to our license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos. Cash used in investing activities increased by $10.7 billion to $12.5 billion in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher net purchases of marketable securities. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities increased by $4.4 billion to $9.3 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock, higher net payments on debt, higher payments of cash dividends and lower proceeds from the issuances of debt. These increases were partially offset by lower payments to settle warrants related to the Convertible Notes. Cash used in financing activities increased by $1.9 billion to $5.0 billion in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock and payments of cash dividends, which began in 2015. These increases were partially offset by lower net payments on debt and higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. Debt and Credit Facility Long-Term Obligations The summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in Note 11, Debt and Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 55 Debt Financing In September 2016 , we issued our 2016 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion and in December 2016, repaid $700 million of principal balance related to our senior unsecured notes. In September 2015 , we issued our 2015 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion . We intend to use the net proceeds from the 2016 Notes and 2015 Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt, working capital, payments of cash dividends, repurchases of our outstanding common stock pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program and future acquisitions. We are required to comply with certain covenants under our notes indentures and as of December 31, 2016 , we were not in violation of any covenants. Convertible Notes Repayment and Warrant Settlements Our Convertible Notes were partially converted during 2016 and 2015 and on May 1, 2016, the remainder matured. We repaid an aggregate principal balance of $285 million and $213 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also paid in cash $956 million and $784 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the conversion spread of the Convertible Notes. We received $956 million and $784 million in cash during 2016 and 2015, respectively, from our convertible note hedges related to the Convertible Notes. During 2015, a portion of the warrants related to the Convertible Notes was modified and settled, and in August 2016, the remainder expired. We paid $469 million and $3.9 billion during 2016 and 2015, respectively, to settle the warrants as the average market price of our common stock exceeded the warrants exercise price. Credit Facility In 2016, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility and entered into a new $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021. The facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and as of December 31, 2016 , we were not in violation of any covenants, and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Capital Return Program Stock Repurchase Programs In February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (2016 Program). Purchases under the 2016 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The 2016 Program commenced after the $15.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2015 was completed in the second quarter of 2016. The $5.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in May 2014 was completed in the first quarter of 2015. The $5.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2011 was completed in 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2016 Program was $9 billion . The following table summarizes our stock repurchases under the above-described programs (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Shares repurchased and retired 123 95 59 Amount $ 11,001 $ 10,002 $ 5,349 Dividends On February 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 30, 2017 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2017. In April 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per common share, which became effective for the second quarter of 2016. During 2016 , we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion or $1.84 per common share. In the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a cash dividend of $0.43 per common share. During 2015, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $1.9 billion or $1.29 per share. Capital Resources We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; 56 the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; debt service requirements; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation, including matters related to sofosbuvir. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. Government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information. Government and Other Rebates and Chargebacks Government and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the United States, including Medicaid rebates, AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, Veterans Administration and Public Health Service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. Our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $636 million as of December 31, 2016 and $907 million as of December 31, 2015 . Our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in Accrued government and other rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and totaled $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 . Our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third-party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory data and/or other market data. We also consider new information regarding changes in programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. During the last 57 three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates. The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions): Accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks: Balance at Beginning of Year Decrease/(Increase) to Product Sales Payments Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2016: Activity related to 2016 sales $ $ 19,219 $ (13,920 ) $ 5,299 Activity related to sales prior to 2016 5,025 (148 ) (4,519 ) 358 Total $ 5,025 $ 19,071 $ (18,439 ) $ 5,657 Year ended December 31, 2015: Activity related to 2015 sales $ $ 16,400 $ (11,597 ) $ 4,803 Activity related to sales prior to 2015 2,536 7 (2,321 ) 222 Total $ 2,536 $ 16,407 $ (13,918 ) $ 5,025 The majority of the increase in allowance for government and other rebates and chargebacks in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by higher rebates and chargebacks for our HCV products. Legal Contingencies We are a party to various legal actions. The most significant of these are described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. We recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. Upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. We did not recognize any accruals for such matters as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 as we did not believe losses were probable. Valuation of Intangible Assets In conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to IPR&D projects. We had total intangible assets of $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 . The identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. 58 Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. In 2016, the estimated fair value of our IPR&D related to momelotinib and simtuzumab was written down to zero due to termination of clinical developments of such programs, and as a result, we recorded impairment charges of $432 million within Research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. The valuation allowance was $126 million as of December 31, 2016 and $6 million as of December 31, 2015 . The increase of our valuation allowance from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to write down of the IPR&D value of momelotinib during 2016. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions including Ireland. Due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. We cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. An adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2016 , we do not believe our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months. Due to the high degree of uncertainly on the timing of clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in the United States and in many jurisdictions abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. 59 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2016 (in millions): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Debt (1) $ 42,874 $ 982 $ 3,769 $ 6,582 $ 31,541 Operating lease obligations 369 75 120 72 102 Capital commitments (2) 880 536 341 1 2 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 2,124 1,551 505 44 24 Clinical trials (5) 1,737 752 675 204 106 Total (6) $ 47,984 $ 3,896 $ 5,410 $ 6,903 $ 31,775 _______________________ Notes: (1) Debt primarily consisted of senior unsecured notes, including principal and interest payments. Interest payments are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. See Note 11 , Debt and Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (2) Amounts include firm capital project commitments primarily relating to construction of new buildings. (3) Amounts include firm purchase commitments primarily relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2016, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (CROs). Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. (6) As of December 31, 2016 , our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect liabilities for unrecognized tax positions, interest and penalties totaling $1.9 billion. Due to the high degree of uncertainty on the timing of future cash settlement and other events that could extinguish these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement and therefore we have excluded the liabilities related to unrecognized tax positions from the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The information required by this item is included in Note 1 , Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
