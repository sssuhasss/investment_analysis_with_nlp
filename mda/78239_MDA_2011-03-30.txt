Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 130 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally recognized brand names, including Calvin Klein, Van Heusen, IZOD, Bass, ARROW, Eagle and, as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2010, Tommy Hilfiger (previously a licensed brand), which are owned, and Geoffrey Beene, Kenneth Cole New York, Kenneth Cole Reaction, Sean John, JOE Joseph Abboud, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Michael Kors Collection, CHAPS, Trump (marketed as Donald J. Trump Signature Collection prior to January 1, 2010), DKNY, Elie Tahari, Nautica, Ike Behar, Ted Baker, J. Garcia, Claiborne, Robert Graham, U.S. POLO ASSN., Axcess, Jones New York and Timberland, which are licensed. We completed our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger during the second quarter of 2010. Tommy Hilfiger designs, sources and markets men s, women and children sportswear and activewear, jeanswear and other products worldwide and licenses its brands worldwide over a broad range of products. We paid $2.5 billion in cash and issued 7.9 million shares of our common stock as consideration for the acquisition, for total consideration of approximately $3.0 billion. Our business strategy has been to manage and market a portfolio of nationally recognized brands at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution. We believe this strategy reduces our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference or distribution channel. We have enhanced this strategy by expanding our portfolio of brands through acquisitions of well-known brands, such as Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, that offer additional geographic distribution channel and price point opportunities in our traditional categories of dress shirts and sportswear. A significant portion of our total income before interest and taxes is derived from international sources, which, prior to the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, had been primarily driven by the international component of our Calvin Klein licensing business. The Calvin Klein and, to a lesser degree, Tommy Hilfiger acquisitions also enhanced our business strategy by providing us with established international licensing businesses, which do not require working capital investments. We have successfully pursued growth opportunities in extending the Calvin Klein brands through licensing into additional product categories and geographic areas and may seek to do the same with Tommy Hilfiger . We believe that the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger will advance our business strategy by adding a global brand with growth opportunities and by establishing an international platform in Europe that will be a strategic complement to our strong North American presence and provides us with the resources and expertise needed to grow our heritage brands and businesses internationally. During the third quarter of 2010 we announced the formation of PVH Europe, a division managed by a team of Tommy Hilfiger executives and dedicated staff based in Amsterdam. The division has been formed to pursue international opportunities for our heritage brands. Its first endeavor is operating the ARROW business in parts of Europe, which commenced with the Fall 2011 collection. We plan to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through rapid deleveraging and effective working capital management. We made approximately $250 million in voluntary debt repayments on the debt we incurred to purchase Tommy Hilfiger in 2010. In addition, in March 2011 we repaid an additional $150 million on such debt, for repayments totaling approximately $400 million since the closing of the acquisition. We believe that our persistent focus on and enhancement of our business strategies and our balance sheet strength will allow us to continue to invest in our businesses and capitalize on opportunities for future growth. On March 11, 2011, an earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan. We have assets, including goodwill, assigned to our Tommy Hilfiger Japan reporting unit, which is a retail business, the vast majority of the operations of which are outside of the areas most affected by the disaster. We also generate royalty, advertising and other revenue in Japan through our Calvin Klein licensing business. We currently expect that our revenue related to our Calvin Klein licensing and Tommy Hilfiger Japan businesses will be negatively impacted but such impact would not have a material adverse affect on the Company or our results of operations. We have contemplated this impact in our 2011 guidance discussed below. 29 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to wholesale customers and franchise, licensee and distributor operated stores of men dress shirts and neckwear, men and women sportswear, footwear, accessories and related products; and (ii) the sale, through over 1,000 company-operated retail locations worldwide, of apparel, footwear, accessories and other products under the brand names Van Heusen, IZOD, Bass , Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger . In addition, into the fourth quarter of 2008, we operated retail stores under the brand name Geoffrey Beene . We generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue, which comprised 82% of total royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2010, is derived under licenses and other arrangements for a broad array of products, including jeans, underwear, fragrances, eyewear, footwear, women apparel, outerwear, watches and home furnishings. We completed the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger early in the second quarter of 2010. We recorded pre-tax charges in 2010 in connection with the acquisition and integration of Tommy Hilfiger that totaled $338.3 million, which includes: (i) a loss of $140.5 million associated with hedges against Euro to United States dollar exchange rates relating to the purchase price; (ii) short-lived non-cash valuation amortization charges of $76.8 million, which became fully amortized during the third quarter of 2010; and (iii) transaction, restructuring and debt extinguishment costs of $121.0 million. We expect to incur additional pre-tax expenses of approximately $60 million during 2011 in connection with the integration of Tommy Hilfiger, including lease termination and related costs and severance, termination benefits and other costs. Our future results of operations will be significantly impacted by this acquisition, including through the operations of the Tommy Hilfiger business and the changes in our capital structure that were necessary to complete the acquisition, as more fully discussed below. We exited in the fourth quarter of 2010 our United Kingdom and Ireland Van Heusen dresswear and accessories business. We recorded pre-tax charges in 2010 in connection with this exit of $6.6 million, which consists principally of non-cash charges. Gross profit on total revenue is total revenue less cost of goods sold. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, including inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs and other product procurement related charges. 100% of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. 30 The following table summarizes our income statements in 2010, 2009 and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 4,219.7 $ 2,070.8 $ 2,160.7 Royalty revenue 309.6 242.0 236.6 Advertising and other revenue 107.5 86.0 94.7 Total revenue 4,636.8 2,398.7 2,491.9 Gross profit 2,422.0 1,182.6 1,200.7 % of total revenue 52.2 % 49.3 % 48.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,071.4 938.8 1,028.8 % of total revenue 44.7 % 39.1 % 41.3 % Debt extinguishment costs 6.7 - - Other loss 140.5 - - Gain on sale of investments - - 1.9 Income before interest and taxes 203.4 243.8 173.7 Interest expense 128.6 33.5 33.6 Interest income 1.7 1.3 6.2 Income before taxes 76.6 211.6 146.3 Income tax expense 22.8 49.7 54.5 Net income $ 53.8 $ 161.9 $ 91.8 Net Sales Our net sales were $4,219.7 million in 2010, $2,070.8 million in 2009 and $2,160.7 million in 2008. The 2010 net sales increase of $2,149.0 million as compared to 2009 net sales was due principally to the effect of the following items: The addition of $889.6 million and $1,007.8 million of net sales attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, respectively, as a result of the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger early in the second quarter of 2010. The addition of $129.4 million of combined net sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Wholesale Dress Furnishings and Heritage Brand Wholesale Sportswear segments resulting from better performance across almost all brands, with Van Heusen performing particularly well. The addition of $88.0 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Other (Calvin Klein Apparel) segment, which is comprised of our Calvin Klein dress furnishings, sportswear and outlet retail divisions, as both our Calvin Klein wholesale and retail divisions exhibited strong growth during 2010. Comparable store sales in our Calvin Klein outlet retail business increased 13% in 2010. The addition of $28.6 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Retail segment. This was principally driven by an overall comparable store sales increase of 8%. The addition of $5.6 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Calvin Klein Licensing segment. 31 The 2009 net sales decrease of $90.0 million as compared to 2008 net sales was due principally to the net effect of the following items: The net reduction of $82.6 million of net sales in our Heritage Brand Retail segment, comprised of (i) a $94.9 million reduction in net sales associated with our closing in 2008 of our Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division; and (ii) the addition of $12.3 million of net sales attributable to growth associated with our ongoing retail businesses, which was primarily driven by an overall comparable store sales increase of 2%. The reduction of $28.6 million of net sales attributable to a decline in our Heritage Brand Wholesale Sportswear segment resulting from the economic slowdown, which occurred late in 2008 and continued into the first half of 2009, and the resulting reduction of sales to our department store customers. This decrease was partially offset by additional sales associated with our new Timberland men sportswear line, which was launched in the second quarter of 2008. The addition of $13.0 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Other (Calvin Klein Apparel) segment, which is comprised of our Calvin Klein dress furnishings, sportswear and outlet retail divisions. This was primarily driven by the addition of sales attributable to the conversion of a limited number of Geoffrey Beene outlet retail stores to the Calvin Klein outlet retail format. This increase was partially offset by declines in our Calvin Klein dress furnishings and sportswear divisions resulting from the economic slowdown discussed above. The addition of $9.0 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Wholesale Dress Furnishings segment. Our net sales in 2011 are currently expected to increase to $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion from $4.2 billion in the prior year, due primarily to the effect of owning Tommy Hilfiger for a full year. Net sales in our Heritage Brands and Calvin Klein businesses are currently projected to increase approximately 3% to 4% as compared to the prior year. Royalty, Advertising and Other Revenue Royalty, advertising and other revenue was $417.1 million in 2010 as compared to $328.0 million in the prior year. Of the $89.1 million increase over the prior year, $47.8 million was attributable to Tommy Hilfiger. Within the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, royalty revenue increased $26.2 million, or 12%, as compared to the prior year due to strong performance across virtually all product categories, with jeans, underwear, fragrance, watches, women sportswear and dresses performing particularly well. In addition, advertising and other revenue increased $13.1 million for the Calvin Klein Licensing segment. Such advertising and other revenue is generally collected and spent, and is therefore presented as both a revenue and an expense within our income statement, with minimal impact on earnings. Royalty, advertising and other revenue was $328.0 million in 2009 as compared to $331.2 million in the prior year. Within the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, royalty revenue increased 4% in 2009 compared to the prior year, as a 5% increase in royalty revenue on a constant exchange rate basis more than offset a $2.1 million negative impact from a stronger United States dollar over the period. The royalty growth on a constant exchange rate basis was principally due to strong performance in the jeans, underwear, footwear, women apparel and outerwear businesses, mostly offset by a royalty decrease, particularly in the first half of 2009, in the fragrance business, which was affected by reductions in travel and discretionary spending as a result of a difficult economic environment. Advertising and other revenue decreased 9% in 2009 compared to the prior year as a result of less discretionary spending in 2009 as compared to 2008 by our licensees, as 2008 included spending associated with the 40 th anniversary of Calvin Klein . We currently expect that royalty, advertising and other revenue will increase to approximately $450 million in 2011 from $417.1 million in 2010. This increase is due to growth within the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, as Calvin Klein royalty revenue is expected to increase approximately 7% to 8% in 2011, combined with the effect of owning Tommy Hilfiger for a full year. 32 Gross Profit on Total Revenue The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for 2010, 2009 and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Components of revenue: Net sales 91.0 % 86.3 % 86.7 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 9.0 % 13.7 % 13.3 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit as a % of total revenue 52.2 % 49.3 % 48.2 % Gross profit on total revenue in 2010 was $2,422.0 million, or 52.2% of total revenue, compared to $1,182.6 million, or 49.3% of total revenue in 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 290 basis points in 2010 as compared with 2009, due principally to the net effect of the following items: A reduction of 100 basis points, attributable to $47.1 million of charges that were recorded in 2010 as a result of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, principally related to short-lived non-cash valuation amortization. An increase of 390 basis points over the prior year, principally due to the net impact of (i) an increase due to Tommy Hilfiger large international presence, as international apparel businesses typically have higher gross margin percentages than domestic apparel businesses; (ii) an increase due to Tommy Hilfiger North America operations, the majority of which consists of its retail business, and retail businesses typically have higher gross margin percentages than wholesale businesses; and (iii) a decrease due to a change in revenue mix, as royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, decreased as a percentage of total revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased 110 basis points in 2009 as compared with 2008, due principally to the net effect of the following items: An increase of 70 basis points due principally to decreased promotional selling during 2009 as compared to 2008 due to strong performance across all of our businesses. An increase of 20 basis points due to the absence of inventory liquidation markdowns which occurred during 2008 associated with the closure of our Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division. An increase of 20 basis points due principally to a change in revenue mix, as royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, increased as a percentage of total revenue. We currently expect that the gross profit on total revenue percentage in 2011 will decrease as compared with 2010. Product cost increases, which we began to experience late in 2010, are expected to continue and have a significant effect on our cost of goods sold in 2011. In addition, we expect a decrease due to a change in revenue mix, as royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, is expected to decrease as a percentage of total revenue due to the effect of owning Tommy Hilfiger for a full year. These decreases in the gross profit on total revenue percentage are expected to more than offset the favorable impacts from the addition of first quarter revenue attributable to the Tommy Hilfiger business, which has high gross margin percentages as discussed above, and the absence in 2011 of short-lived non-cash valuation amortization charges, which were recorded during 2010 as a result of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 2,071.4 $ 938.8 $ 1,028.8 % of total revenue 44.7 % 39.1 % 41.3 % 33 SG&A expenses in 2010 increased $1,132.6 million to $2,071.4 million, or 44.7% of total revenue, from $938.8 million, or 39.1% of total revenue in 2009. Included in the 560 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue over the prior year period are $150.6 million, or 330 basis points, of transaction, restructuring, non-cash valuation amortization and other charges in connection with our acquisition and integration of Tommy Hilfiger and costs associated with the exit from our United Kingdom and Ireland Van Heusen dresswear and accessories business. The non-cash valuation amortization charges relate to acquired order backlog, which had an amortization period of six months and became fully amortized during the third quarter of 2010. The remaining 230 basis point increase is principally attributable to Tommy Hilfiger large international presence, as international apparel businesses typically have higher SG&A expense percentages than domestic apparel businesses. In addition, the majority of Tommy Hilfiger North America operations consists of its retail business, and retail businesses typically have higher SG&A expense percentages than wholesale businesses. Also contributing to the SG&A expense percentage increase is an increase in advertising expenses related to our Calvin Klein and heritage brands over the prior year. SG&A expenses in 2009 decreased $90.0 million to $938.8 million, or 39.1% of total revenue, from $1,028.8 million, or 41.3% of total revenue in 2008. The 220 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2009 as compared to 2008 was due principally to (i) the absence of asset impairment charges and costs associated with our 2008 restructuring initiatives and the closure of our Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division; and (ii) cost savings realized in 2009 from our restructuring initiatives, partially offset by a lack of sales leverage as a result of the sales decrease mentioned previously. We currently expect that our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2011 will decrease significantly as compared to 2010 due principally to reduced acquisition, integration and restructuring costs associated with Tommy Hilfiger and the absence of costs associated with the exit from our United Kingdom and Ireland Van Heusen dresswear and accessories business. Debt Extinguishment We incurred costs of $6.7 million in 2010 on the extinguishment of our 7 1/4% senior notes due 2011 and our 8 1/8% senior notes due 2013. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of the tender for, and redemption of, these notes. Other Loss We entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase 1.55 billion in connection with the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger to hedge against our exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the Euro, as a portion of the acquisition purchase price was payable in cash and denominated in Euros. We settled the foreign currency forward exchange contracts on May 6, 2010 in connection with our completion of the acquisition. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $140.5 million during the first half of 2010 related to these contracts. Gain on Sale of Investments We sold, in the first quarter of 2006, minority interests held by one of our subsidiaries in certain entities that operate the licenses and related wholesale and retail businesses of Calvin Klein jeans and accessories in Europe and Asia and the ck Calvin Klein bridge line of sportswear and accessories in Europe. During 2008, we received a distribution of $1.9 million representing our share of the amount that remained in an escrow account established in connection with that transaction. We recorded this amount as a gain. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense increased to $128.6 million in 2010 from $33.5 million in 2009 principally as a result of the issuance during the second quarter of 2010 of $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020 and term loans of $1.9 billion borrowed under new credit facilities, the net proceeds of which were used in connection with the purchase of Tommy Hilfiger. We made a $100.0 million voluntary debt repayment on the term loans in the second quarter of 2010 and an additional $150.0 million voluntary debt repayment on the term loans in the fourth quarter of 2010. Interest income increased to $1.7 million in 2010 from the prior year amount of $1.3 million due principally to an increase in our average cash position during the year. Interest expense of $33.5 million in 2009 was relatively flat to the 2008 amount of $33.6 million. Interest income decreased to $1.3 million in 2009 from $6.2 million in 2008. This decrease was due principally to a decrease in average investment rates of return. 34 Net interest expense for the full year 2011 is currently expected to increase to a range of $134 million to $136 million from $126.8 million in the prior year principally as a result of the full year impact of the increased debt carried by us in connection with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. We made a voluntary debt repayment of approximately $150.0 million at the beginning of March 2011 and currently plan on making approximately $300.0 million of additional voluntary debt repayments on our term loans during the remainder of 2011. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility, which amended the credit facility we entered into in May 2010 in connection with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. The amended facility provides reduced borrowing spreads and fees, as well as additional flexibility with respect to the application of voluntary prepayments. The full benefit of the reduction in borrowing spreads and fees is not expected to be realized, as we currently intend to enter into contracts to swap a portion of our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (dollars in millions) Income tax expense $ 22.8 $ 49.7 $ 54.5 Income tax expense as a % of pre-tax income 29.7 % 23.5 % 37.3 % The effective tax rate for 2010 was 29.7% compared with the 2009 effective tax rate of 23.5%. Our effective tax rate in 2010 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due to earnings from our international Tommy Hilfiger business, a significant portion of which is subject to favorable tax rates, a benefit resulting from the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain previously unrecognized tax positions and a benefit from the reduction of the Netherlands tax rate in the fourth quarter from 25.5% to 25.0%. The 2010 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the non-deductibility of certain costs, principally those associated with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, and the inclusion of certain international income being taxed in the U.S. Our effective tax rate in 2009 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due to the favorable impact of a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service relating to the audit of our federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2007 and the effect of the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to previously unrecognized tax positions. We currently anticipate that our 2011 tax rate will be between 29% and 31%, which compares with the 2010 full year rate of 29.7%. As compared to 2010, the 2011 tax rate is expected to be favorably impacted by additional first quarter earnings from our international Tommy Hilfiger business, a significant portion of which is subject to favorable tax rates, and the absence of certain non-deductible costs incurred in 2010, principally those associated with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. Offsetting these favorable variances is the negative impact of additional 2011 international earnings expected to be taxed in the U.S. It is possible that our estimated full year rate could change from the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, or from discrete events arising from specific transactions, audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary Our net cash flow in 2010 was $17.8 million. Cash flow in 2011 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including the amount of voluntary debt repayments we make in 2011. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $352.2 million in 2010, which compares with $214.4 million in 2009. The factors that affect our cash provided by operating activities have been significantly impacted by the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger. In the future, we expect that our cash provided by operating activities will generally increase by a significant amount and our historical cash flow patterns will change significantly as a result of the acquisition. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2010 were $101.0 million compared to $23.9 million expended in 2009. This increase was due principally to investments in the Tommy Hilfiger business and our corporate infrastructure to support our expanded operations. Additionally, 2009 spending was at reduced levels due to the overall economic environment. We currently expect capital expenditures in 2011 to be approximately $200.0 million. 35 Contingent Purchase Price Payments In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the agreement governing this acquisition, as amended) of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $43.7 million in 2010. We currently expect that such payments will be between $46 million and $48 million in 2011. Acquisitions Tommy Hilfiger Acquisition We completed our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger on May 6, 2010. We paid $2,485.8 million in cash and issued 7.9 million shares of our common stock, valued at $475.6 million, as consideration for the acquisition, for total consideration of approximately $3.0 billion. In addition, we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase 1.55 billion in connection with the acquisition to hedge against our exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the Euro, as a portion of the cash component of the purchase price was denominated in Euros. We settled the foreign currency forward exchange contracts at a loss of $140.5 million on May 6, 2010 in connection with completing the acquisition. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition with cash on hand and the net proceeds of the following activities: (i) the sale of 5.8 million shares of our common stock; (ii) the issuances of an aggregate of 8,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for an aggregate gross purchase price of $200.0 million; (iii) the issuance of $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020; and (iv) the borrowing of $1.9 billion of term loans under new credit facilities. Please refer to the discussion below for further detail on these activities. Tommy Hilfiger Handbag License Acquisition On June 14, 2010, we entered into an agreement to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger handbags outside of the United States. The effective date of the transfer of the rights was December 31, 2010. In connection with this transaction, we made a payment of $7.3 million, based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the acquisition date, to the former licensee during the second quarter of 2010. Please refer to the section entitled Acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger Handbag License in Note 2, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion. Common Stock Offering We sold 5.8 million shares of our common stock on April 28, 2010 for net proceeds, after commissions, discounts and related fees and expenses of $364.5 million, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Issuance On May 6, 2010, we sold an aggregate of 8,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $100.00 per share, for an aggregate gross purchase price of $200.0 million. We received net proceeds of $188.6 million in connection with this issuance, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. The Series A convertible preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and is convertible at a price of $47.74 into 4.2 million shares of common stock. The conversion price was established in a definitive agreement, which formed a binding commitment with the preferred stockholders in March 2010, and is subject to equitable adjustment in the event of us taking certain actions, including stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, consolidations or other capital reorganizations. The Series A convertible preferred stock is not subject to mandatory redemption nor is it redeemable, in whole or in part, by us at our option or that of any holder. The holders of the Series A convertible preferred stock are entitled to vote and participate in dividends with the holders of our common stock on an as-converted basis. 36 Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Our Series A convertible preferred stock participates in common stock dividends on an as-converted basis. Dividends on common and preferred stock totaled $10.0 million for the full year 2010. We currently project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2011 will be approximately $10.5 million to $11.0 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding at January 30, 2011 and our estimates of stock to be issued during 2011 under our stock incentive plans. Financing Arrangements Our capital structure as of January 30, 2011 was as follows: (in millions) Short-term borrowings $ 4.9 Long-term debt 2,364.0 Stockholders equity 2,442.6 In addition, we had $498.7 million of cash and cash equivalents as of January 30, 2011. Short-Term Borrowings One of our subsidiaries has a Yen-denominated overdraft facility with a Japanese bank, which provides for borrowings of 1,000.0 million (approximately $12.2 million based on the Yen to United States dollar exchange rate in effect on January 30, 2011) and is utilized to fund working capital. Borrowings under the facility are unsecured and bear interest at the one month Japanese inter-bank borrowing rate ( TIBOR ) plus 0.15%. Such facility matures on July 19, 2011 and renews automatically unless we give notice of termination. The outstanding balance was 400.0 million ($4.9 million based on the Yen to United States dollar exchange rate in effect on January 30, 2011) as of January 30, 2011 with the balance of 600.0 million ($7.3 million based on the Yen to United States dollar exchange rate in effect on January 30, 2011) remaining undrawn under the facility. The weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed at January 30, 2011 was 0.33%. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under this facility during the year ended January 30, 2011 was approximately $8.5 million. Tender for and Redemption of 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes We commenced tender offers on April 7, 2010 for (i) all of the $150.0 million outstanding principal amount of our notes due 2011; and (ii) all of the $150.0 million outstanding principal amount of our notes due 2013. The tender offers expired on May 4, 2010. On May 6, 2010, we accepted for purchase all of the notes tendered and made payment to tendering holders and called for redemption all of the balance of our outstanding 7 1/4% senior notes due 2011 and all of the balance of our outstanding 8 1/8% senior notes due 2013. The redemption prices of the notes due 2011 and 2013 were 100.000% and 101.354%, respectively, of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the applicable note, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On May 6, 2010, we made an irrevocable payment, including accrued and unpaid interest, to the trustee for the notes due 2011 and 2013. As a result, such indentures were satisfied and effectively discharged as of May 6, 2010. 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 Our $600.0 million 7 3/8% senior notes, which we issued on May 6, 2010 under an indenture dated as of May 6, 2010, are due May 15, 2020. Interest on the 7 3/8% notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem some or all of these notes on or after May 15, 2015 at specified redemption prices. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to May 15, 2015 by paying a make whole premium. In addition, we may also redeem up to 35% of these notes prior to May 15, 2013 with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. 37 Senior Secured Credit Facility Our senior secured credit facility, which we entered into on May 6, 2010, consists of a Euro-denominated term loan A facility, a United States dollar-denominated term loan A facility, a Euro-denominated term loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated term loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and two multi-currency (one United States dollar and Canadian dollar, and the other Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound) revolving credit facilities. We borrowed $1.9 billion of term loans on May 6, 2010 and made voluntary repayments of $250.0 million on these term loans during 2010. As of January 30, 2011, we had an aggregate of $1.7 billion of borrowings under the term loan facilities outstanding (based on the applicable exchange rates in effect on January 30, 2011). As of January 30, 2011 the credit facility provided for approximately $455 million of revolving credit (based on the applicable exchange rates in effect on January 30, 2011), under which we had no revolving credit borrowings and $138 million of letters of credit outstanding as of January 30, 2011. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility, which amended the credit facility we entered into in May 2010 in connection with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. The amended facility provides reduced borrowing spreads and fees, as well as additional flexibility with respect to the application of voluntary prepayments. The full benefit of the reduction in borrowing spreads and fees is not expected to be realized, as we currently intend to enter into contracts to swap a portion of our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. The amended facility extends the maturity of the term loan A facilities and the revolving loan facilities from May 2015 to January 2016. The maturity of the term loan B facilities remains in May 2016. The amended facility consists of United States dollar-denominated and Euro-denominated term loan facilities in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,040 million and approximately 347 million, respectively, and revolving credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $450 million, based on the applicable exchange rates in effect as of the date of the amendment (including a United States dollar facility and two multi-currency facilities, one United States dollar and Canadian dollar, and the other Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound). The revolving credit facilities remained undrawn upon the closing of the amended credit facility (with only letters of credit outstanding). In connection with the closing of the amended facility, we voluntarily prepaid approximately $150 million of borrowings with cash on hand, which we had previously announced we intended to use for such purpose. The aggregate amount outstanding under the amended facility is the same as the aggregate amount outstanding under the credit facility prior to the amendment and restatement, other than with respect to the approximately $150 million voluntary prepayment, and reflects a total reduction by approximately $400 million of the amount initially borrowed at the time of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition closing. The terms of each of the term loan A and B facilities contain a mandatory repayment schedule on a quarterly basis, such that the total annual repayments are as follows: Term Loan A B Amended and restated borrowings on March 2, 2011, based on the applicable exchange rate at that date $ 759,804 $ 759,411 Percentage required to be repaid for the annual period ending May 6: 2012 5 % 1 % 2013 10 % 1 % 2014 15 % 1 % 2015 25 % 1 % 2016 45 % 96 % The outstanding borrowings under the amended facility are prepayable without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The terms of the amended facility require us to repay certain amounts outstanding thereunder with (a) net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, (b) net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds, to the extent such proceeds are not reinvested in the business in accordance with customary reinvestment provisions and (c) a percentage of excess cash flow, which percentage is based upon our leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined as the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1% (provided that, 38 in the case of the term loan B facility, in no event will the base rate be deemed to be less than 1.75%) or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the amended facility (provided that, in the case of the term loan B facility, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be deemed to be less than 0.75%). Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the average of the rates of interest per annum equal to the per annum rate of interest quoted, published and commonly known in Canada as the prime rate or which Royal Bank of Canada establishes at its main office in Toronto, Ontario as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month that appears on the Reuters Screen CDOR Page as of 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the date of determination, as reported by the administrative agent (and if such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be selected by the administrative agent), and (y) 1%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the amended facility. The borrowings under the amended facility in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the amended facility (provided that, in the case of the term loan B facility, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be deemed to be less than 0.75%). The initial applicable margins will be (a) in the case of the United States dollar-denominated term loan A facility, 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, as applicable, (b) in the case of the United States dollar-denominated term loan B facility, 2.75% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.75% for base rate loans, as applicable, (c) in the case of the Euro-denominated term loan A facility, 2.75%, (d) in the case of the Euro-denominated term loan B facility, 3.00% and (e) in the case of the revolving credit facilities, (x) for borrowings denominated in United States dollars, 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, as applicable, (y) for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for Canadian prime rate loans, as applicable, and (z) for borrowings denominated in other currencies, 2.75%. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to the Company fiscal quarter ending May 1, 2011, the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan A facilities and the revolving credit facilities will be adjusted based on the Company leverage ratio. Our amended facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under our other outstanding debt. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit; make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making distributions on, or redeeming or repurchasing, our capital stock or certain debt; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, lease all or substantially all of our assets. Our amended facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maximum leverage, minimum interest coverage and maximum capital expenditures. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the applicable facility. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable which would 39 result in acceleration of our other debt. If we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due, the lenders could proceed against their collateral, which also secures some of our other indebtedness. We are also subject to similar covenants and restrictions in connection with our other long-term debt agreements. As of January 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of January 30, 2011, our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2011 2012-2013 2014-2015 Thereafter (in millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,364.4 $ - $ 147.6 $ 290.2 $ 1,926.6 Interest payments on long-term debt (1) 910.3 136.3 258.8 234.5 280.7 Short-term borrowings (1) 4.9 4.9 - - - Operating and capital leases (2) 1,703.2 275.9 457.9 346.5 622.9 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 811.5 811.5 - - - Minimum contractual royalty payments (4) 66.0 20.9 31.6 9.2 4.3 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan (5) 32.8 2.3 5.4 5.7 19.4 Severance payments (6) 17.1 16.1 1.0 - - Sponsorship payments (7) 46.9 12.2 19.8 13.7 1.2 Other contractual obligations (8) 25.5 9.6 8.4 7.5 - Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,982.6 $ 1,289.7 $ 930.5 $ 907.3 $ 2,855.1 ______________________ (1) At January 30, 2011 we have outstanding $437.8 million of senior secured term loan A facility and $1,226.6 million of senior secured term loan B facility maturing between May 6, 2011 and May 6, 2016 (according to a mandatory repayment schedule and prior to the amendment and restatement of the senior secured term loan facility as discussed above), $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2020, $100.0 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023 and $4.9 million of short-term borrowings under our overdraft facility with a Japanese bank. We made voluntary payments on the senior secured term loans during 2010 and are therefore not required to make any mandatory repayments until 2012 under the agreement in effect at January 30, 2011. Our amended and restated senior secured credit facility requires that we make mandatory repayments as discussed above under the subheading Senior Secured Credit Facility. Interest on the senior secured term loans is payable quarterly and interest on the senior unsecured notes and debentures is payable semi-annually. (2) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please refer to Note 14, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (3) Represents contractual commitments for goods on order and not received or paid for as of January 30, 2011. Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our fiscal year end. This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please refer to Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different royalty rates and terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, with no minimum amount required to be paid. These amounts, as well as any advertising spending requirements, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under 40 these agreements, we currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (5) We have an unfunded non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering four current and 16 retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, we also have for certain members of Tommy Hilfiger domestic senior management a supplemental executive retirement plan, which is a non-qualified unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan. Such plan is frozen and, as a result, participants do not accrue additional benefits. (6) Represents severance payment obligations primarily related to the acquisition and integration of Tommy Hilfiger. (7) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships, including our sponsorship of the Indy Racing League. We entered into agreements for our IZOD brand to be the title sponsor of the newly re-named IZOD IndyCar Series and the official apparel partner of the Indy Racing League and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. These amounts also include payment obligations relating to our Van Heusen brand sponsorship of the Van Heusen Pro Football Hall of Fame Fan Choice, obligations related to our naming rights for the IZOD Center sports and entertainment arena, sponsorships of certain professional sports teams and other similar sponsorships. (8) Represents fixed amounts payable in connection with Tommy Hilfiger acquisition of a licensee business in Japan prior to our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, which obligations we assumed as of the effective date of our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales, as defined in the agreement governing the acquisition of Calvin Klein, of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands and are required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $43.7 million in 2010. Not included in the above table are contributions to our defined benefit qualified pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note 7, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Not included in the above table are $136.5 million of net potential cash obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits. Not included in the above table are $6.8 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 20, Other Comments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 41 MARKET RISK INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY Financial instruments held by us include cash equivalents, short and long-term debt and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of January 30, 2011. Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates. Therefore, a change in short-term interest rates would have an impact on our interest income. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash equivalents, the impact of a further decrease in short-term interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest income, while an increase in short-term interest rates could have a more material impact. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at January 30, 2011, the effect of a 10 basis point increase in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $0.5 million annually. During the second quarter of 2010, we entered into, and during 2011 amended and restated, the senior secured credit facility described in Part I, Item 7 of this report under the heading Senior Secured Credit Facility, which includes facilities denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the fact that certain of our debt is denominated in foreign currency, our interest expense is, and in the future will continue to be, impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate, each of which is determined based on the jurisdiction of such borrowings. As such, our credit facility also exposes us to market risk for changes in interest rates. Given our debt position and the Euro to United States dollar exchange rate at March 2, 2011 (the effective date of the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facility), the effect of a 10 basis point increase in interest rates on our interest expense would be approximately $1.1 million annually and the effect of a 5% increase in the exchange rate on our interest expense would be $0.9 million annually. We currently intend to enter into contracts to swap a portion of our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates has increased significantly as a result of the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, as the Tommy Hilfiger business has a substantial international component. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Canadian dollar, will have a significantly larger negative impact on our results of operations than prior to the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger. Our Tommy Hilfiger business purchases the majority of the products that it sells in United States dollars, which exposes the international Tommy Hilfiger business to foreign exchange risk as the United States dollar fluctuates. As such, we currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with United States dollar denominated purchases by the Tommy Hilfiger business. We are also exposed to market risk for changes in exchange rates for the United States dollar in connection with our licensing businesses, particularly our Calvin Klein business. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in the licensee local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect payment, we are exposed to exchange rate changes during and up to the last day of the selling period. In addition, certain of our other foreign license agreements expose us to exchange rate changes up to the date we collect payment or convert local currency payments into United States dollars. As a result, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be adversely impacted, and during times of a weakening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be favorably impacted. SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales and income in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales and income in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether to consolidate variable interest entities, as well as when to make these evaluations. The guidance also requires additional disclosures about an entity involvement in variable interest entities. We adopted this guidance beginning in 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 42 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories related to our wholesale operations and international retail operations, comprised principally of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories related to our North American retail operations, comprised entirely of finished goods, are stated at the lower of average cost or market using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost is calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. Permanent and point of sale markdowns, when recorded, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost-to-retail relationship. Based on a review of current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories, a further adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns, which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at January 30, 2011 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2010 and 2009, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our outlet retail stores and other locations were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 15, Activity Exit Costs and Asset Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable, as presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial position of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. 43 Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment based on fair value. These tests are performed annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar operating characteristics. We calculate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets using a discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. The fair value of all reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization using an estimated control premium. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units. The projected cash flows and weighted average cost of capital may be impacted by adverse changes in market and economic conditions and are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time of the valuation. No impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets resulted from our impairment tests in 2010. If different assumptions for future discounted cash flows and allocation of net assets to our reporting units had been applied, significantly different results of our goodwill impairment tests could have resulted. Pension benefits Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. Note 7, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth the significant rate assumptions used in performing certain calculations related to our pension plans. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock are determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for the present value of any dividends expected to be paid on our common stock during the performance cycle, as the contingently issuable performance shares do not accrue dividends prior to being earned. We record expense for contingently issuable performance shares based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The value of our stock-based awards is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
