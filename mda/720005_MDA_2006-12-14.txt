ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Management Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Management Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company results continue to be highly correlated to the direction of the U.S. equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates, valuation of financial instruments, economic and political trends and industry competition. An environment favorable to the Company results is characterized by a stable political environment, low inflation, low unemployment, upward-trending financial markets, and strong corporate profitability, all of which have a positive influence on investor confidence. During fiscal 2006, long term inflation expectations remained low and the Federal Reserve continued its measured short-term interest rate increases with six 25 basis point rate increases during the first nine months of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices rose 11%, 9% and 5%, respectively, during the fiscal year. 16 Results of Operations - Total Company The Company currently operates through the following seven business segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow and various corporate investments and expenses combined in the "Other" segment. The following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for the Company for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, September 30, September 24, 2006 2005 2004 (in 000's) Total Company Revenues $ 2,632,757 $ 2,156,997 $ 1,829,776 Pretax earnings 342,066 247,971 204,121 Private Client Group Revenues 1,679,813 1,397,578 1,202,368 Pretax earnings 168,519 102,245 107,122 Capital Markets Revenues 487,419 455,151 400,787 Pretax earnings 78,221 77,333 57,910 Asset Management Revenues 200,124 171,916 148,160 Pretax earnings 48,095 40,841 27,875 RJBank Revenues 114,692 45,448 28,104 Pretax earnings 16,003 14,204 8,824 Emerging Markets Revenues 55,263 38,768 27,675 Pretax earnings 2,857 5,927 4,304 Stock Loan/Stock Borrow Revenues 59,947 31,876 16,372 Pretax earnings 8,001 5,962 2,135 Other Revenues 35,499 16,260 6,310 Pretax earnings (loss) 20,370 1,459 (4,049) 17 Year ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 - Total Company The Company had record annual revenues and earnings for the third consecutive year, with net revenues surpassing $2.3 billion. Non-interest expenses rose by 12%, contrasted to a 15% increase in net revenues. Net income exceeded $200 million for the first time in the Company's history, up 42% from the prior year. Driven by a 36% increase in net interest earnings (see table below) combined with solid increases in investment advisory fees (14%) and securities commissions and fees (10%), a modest (6%) increase in investment banking revenues and an increase in financial service fees (35%), all of the Company four major segments had higher revenues and pretax income than in the prior year. Total firm net revenues increased 15%, while pretax profits after consideration of minority interest were up 38% over the prior year. Year ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004 - Total Company The Company had record results for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, with both total and net revenues surpassing $2 billion. Net income of over $150 million was up 18% from the prior year. Driven by robust increases in investment banking revenues (41%) and net interest earnings (48% - see table below) combined with solid increases in investment advisory fees (17%) and securities commissions and fees (10%), all three of the Company largest segments had significantly higher revenues than in the prior year. Capital Markets and Asset Management had even more impressive increases in pretax profits (34% and 47%, respectively). Private Client Group earnings were negatively impacted by legal expenses and settlements. Total firm net revenues increased 14%, while pretax profits after consideration of minority interest were up 21% over the prior year. 18 Net Interest Analysis Year Ended September 30, 2006 September 30, 2005 September 24, 2004 ($ in 000's) Interest Revenue Margin balances: Average balance $ 1,327,121 $ 1,218,486 $ 1,006,007 Average rate 7.4% 5.6% 4.0% Interest revenue - margin balances 98,417 68,125 39,750 Assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations: Average balance 2,983,853 2,390,174 2,288,593 Average rate 4.8% 2.8% 1.1% Interest revenue - segregated assets 141,741 65,847 24,832 Raymond James Bank, FSB interest revenue: Average earning assets 1,980,547 1,063,973 882,123 Average rate 5.8% 4.2% 3.1% Interest revenue - Raymond James Bank, FSB 114,065 45,017 27,318 Stock borrowed interest revenue 59,947 31,876 16,372 Interest revenue- variable interest entities 1,008 822 - Other interest revenue 54,803 33,875 26,492 Total interest revenue $ 469,981 $ 245,562 $ 134,764 Interest Expense Client interest program: Average balance $ 3,793,570 $ 3,228,443 $ 2,715,667 Average rate 3.8% 1.8% 0.4% Interest expense - client interest program 143,428 58,486 11,659 Raymond James Bank, FSB interest expense: Average interest bearing liabilities 1,801,747 971,013 811,268 Average rate 4.1% 2.3% 1.2% Interest expense - Raymond James Bank, FSB 73,529 22,020 9,863 Stock loaned interest expense 47,593 22,873 12,405 Interest expense- variable interest entities 8,368 3,934 - Other interest expense 23,752 10,476 14,590 Total interest expense $ 296,670 $ 117,789 $ 48,517 Net interest income $ 173,311 $ 127,773 $ 86,247 19 Over half of the increase in pretax income was made up of the increase in net interest, 39% of which was generated by RJBank. This increase was a result of the substantial increase in customer deposits and corresponding loan balances at RJBank resulting from the Company inception of a new cash sweep option for certain brokerage clients. The remainder of the increase in interest earnings was primarily related to increased cash balances in customer accounts at the broker-dealers, on which the Company earns a spread, and increased interest earnings on corporate cash balances. Results of Operations - Private Client Group The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Private Client Group segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

While commission and fee revenues increased in the PCG segment of all three broker-dealers, the increases were far more significant in RJA and RJ Ltd. where there has been an increase in the number of Financial Advisors due to successful recruiting. RJA added a net 65 employee Financial Advisors and increased the average production from $379,000 in fiscal 2005 to $404,000 in fiscal 2006. In addition, average assets under management per RJA Financial Advisor has increased to an all time high of $58 million from $50 million at September 2005. RJA has successfully focused on recruiting high-producing Financial Advisors and continued to benefit from industry consolidation. RJA commissions and fees increased 23%. RJ Ltd. added 20 employee Financial Advisors and 13 independent contractor Financial Advisors. RJ Ltd. commissions and fees increased 27%. The modest 5.7% increase in RJFS commissions and fees is primarily attributable to a $65.7 million, or 15.6%, increase in fee based business and mutual fund trails. PCG net interest earnings increased 36% over the prior fiscal year, a combined result of increased client margin balances (up 9%) and increased customer cash balances, on which a spread is earned. Net interest represented 65% of the segment's pretax earnings, down from 78% in fiscal 2005. 20 Financial Service Fees in the PCG segment increased $26.6 million, or 40% over the prior year. The increase included a one-time adjustment of approximately $10 million related to a change from cash to accrual accounting for IRA fees. The increase in other revenue of $17.2 million is predominantly made up of increased mutual fund networking fees and the newly introduced educational and marketing support fee from mutual fund companies. Commission expenses increased 2% more than commission revenue, the result of an increased number of independent contractors (who receive higher payouts) in RJ Ltd, the advances associated with recruiting at RJA and higher payout levels to more productive Financial Advisors. Admin and incentive compensation increased due to the increase in the segment profits and an increased number of support staff related to the growing number of Financial Advisors in RJA and increased compliance staff in RJFS. Business development expenses increased as it includes advertising costs and increased travel and other expenses related to recruiting. Other expenses declined as prior years' expense included historically high legal costs and settlements related to the 2000 - 2002 market decline. PCG margins increased by more than 3% over the prior year, reaching 10.9%. The prior year was negatively impacted by the historically high legal costs and settlements, and the expense of the early stages of independent contractor business in the UK and at RJ Ltd. Year ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004 - Private Client Group The Private Client Group's results reflect an 11% increase in commission and fee revenue. Due to the continued process of upgrading the Company Financial Advisor population, which encompassed the termination of lower producers, the net increase in the number of Financial Advisors was only 2%. The Company branding campaign, which has increased the visibility of the firm name, and the promotion of the AdvisorChoice platform for Financial Advisors has helped to increase Financial Advisor interest in the Company. In particular, the employee firm (RJA) had strong recruiting results in the latter half of the year as the Company benefited from industry consolidation. Most of the increase in commission and fee revenue is attributable to the increased average production of Financial Advisors and was close to the Company's goal of a 10% increase per year. Further productivity gains may be expected, provided the market conditions remain favorable, as newly recruited Financial Advisors complete the transition of their accounts and existing Financial Advisors grow their businesses. While average margin balances increased 21% for the fiscal year, interest revenues within PCG increased 97% as a result of rising short-term interest rates, which also led to higher than normal spreads. Accordingly, PCG net interest earnings increased 37%, and represented nearly 78% of this segment's earnings. Commission expense grew ratably with commission and fee revenue. Increased administrative compensation costs include cost of living raises, a 6% increase in employee headcount and increased incentive compensation and benefit plan accruals related to increased corporate profitability. Communications and Information Processing expense increased as the Company continues its efforts to provide state of the art technology to its Financial Advisors. Business Development expense includes the marketing expenditures to promote the AdvisorChoice platform to prospective Financial Advisors and the Company's branding efforts - including a new television ad and increased air time. These efforts, combined with the stadium naming rights for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers football stadium, have increased the Company name recognition nationwide. Business Development expense also includes increased travel expenses related to recruiting efforts and increased attendance at sales and education conferences. Other expense continues to be dominated by legal expenses and settlements. PCG margins, which were 7.6% in fiscal 2005, were negatively impacted by the losses in the early stage, independent contractor joint venture in the UK, relatively low margins in the private client group in RJ Ltd. (as they grow their independent contractor division) and historically high legal costs and settlements, which has had an estimated 1.5% to 2% impact on PCG margins in each of the past two years. 21 Results of Operations - Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

Commission revenues in the segment were flat, as the 37% decline in fixed income commissions were offset by the 13% increase in institutional equity commissions, the latter continuing to be fueled by an active new issue market. RJA equity market conditions remained strong, allowing RJA to complete 97 managed or co-managed domestic underwritings, just one short of the record 98 underwritings completed in fiscal 2005. RJ Ltd. completed a record 29 managed or co-managed underwritings, up nine from fiscal 2005. Merger and acquisition fees increased modestly from the prior year's record level, offsetting the decline in private placement fees. Equity Capital Market's most active strategic business units in fiscal 2006 were Energy, Technology, Financial Services and Real Estate. The $16 million increase in interest income, predominantly on RJA's fixed income inventories, was offset by an equal increase in interest expense to finance these inventories. Higher interest income and expenses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. RJTCF's revenues were up 19%, to $31.7 million, as RJTCF invested over $276.8 million for institutional investors in 78 real estate transactions compared to $250 million in 93 deals in fiscal 2005. Non-interest expense increased 3% over the prior year, with the most significant increase in other expense. This increase was due to increases within the RJTCF variable interest entities, of which 99% is eliminated through minority interest. 22 Year ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2004 - Capital Markets Institutional commissions were relatively flat, with equity commissions up 11% and fixed income commissions down 14%, as trends established in the prior year continued. Although the number of managed/co-managed corporate underwritings was nearly flat, underwriting fees were up 47% as a result of an increased average deal size and a greater number of lead managed deals. Merger and acquisition fees nearly doubled from fiscal 2004. Equity Capital Markets has nine strategic business units; Real Estate, Energy and Healthcare were the strongest performers during fiscal 2005. These record investment banking results contribute significantly to the firm's profits, as incremental revenues produce a high margin. RJTCF revenues were up 30% and contributed $5 million to the segment's pretax profits. RJTCF syndicates funds that invest in real estate partnerships that qualify for federal and state low income housing tax credits. During fiscal 2005, RJTCF invested over $250 million for institutional investors in 93 real estate transactions compared to $206 million in 80 deals in fiscal 2004. Interest expense, the expense associated with carrying the fixed income trading inventory, was up due to increased interest rates. Non-interest expense was up 11% - with 83% of that increase related to compensation. The remaining expenses were relatively flat.

Increases in assets under management were positively impacted by the recruiting of RJA Financial Advisors. New Financial Advisors brought significant assets into the Company's asset management programs, particularly Eagle and Raymond James Consulting Services ("RJCS"). New managed assets brought in by RJA Financial Advisors totaled $3.9 billion for fiscal 2006, a 70% increase over $2.3 billion added in fiscal 2005. Eagle's total retail assets increased 19% over the prior year. Of Eagle's retail asset total, 35% were introduced by Financial Advisors outside the Raymond James system. Account cancellations exceeded sales in Eagle's institutional accounts due to the loss of a few significant accounts and the closing of the Institutional Growth division in September. RJCS offers 40 independent investment advisors to the Company's clients. Assets managed within the program increased 20% over the prior year. The Company's managed mutual fund product (Freedom) continued to experience significant growth (105%) as this concept continues to be embraced by clients and Financial Advisors. Heritage Asset Management's non-money market funds increased 19% with 65% of the sales through broker-dealers outside of the Raymond James family. Heritage money market accounts increased 4% despite the movement of just under $1 billion to the RJBank sweep option during the year. Expenses in this segment increased $19 million (15%) with $9 million of that increase in compensation. The Compensation increase included increased salary expense, costs associated with closing Eagle's institutional growth division, and increased incentive compensation related to the 18% increase in pretax profits. The other notable increase in expense was a $7 million (16%) increase in other expense consisting predominantly of the fees paid to outside money managers in RJCS. Year ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004 - Asset Management Investment advisory fees increased roughly 17%. Due to the billing schedules this increase does not correlate directly to the increase in average assets under management. Approximately one-half of the Company assets under management are billed based on beginning-of-quarter balances and slightly less than one-third are billed based on average daily balances. The remaining assets under management are predominantly billed based on end-of-quarter balances. The overall growth of managed equity programs was the aggregate result of strong net sales and market appreciation. Eagle Asset Management has several portfolio managers with strong performance records and the firm has been successful in winning a growing number of institutional accounts. Accordingly, assets managed for institutional accounts increased 34% over the prior year. Several of the same portfolio managers also manage portfolios for the Heritage Asset Management family of mutual funds. Assets in these funds, excluding the money market funds, increased 28% over the prior year. 24 In addition to Eagle portfolio managers, the asset management division of RJA offers 30 independent investment advisors to the Company's clients through its RJCS program. Assets managed within this program have increased 37% over the prior year. The Company has also seen significant growth (153%) in its managed mutual fund product (Freedom) as this concept is extremely popular with Financial Advisors and clients. Expense growth in this segment was a modest 9%, primarily reflecting increased personnel costs related to profit-based incentive compensation and increased business development expenses related to increased travel and proposal costs. Other expense is predominantly fees paid to outside money managers. With the capacity to increase assets under management significantly in certain disciplines without significant additional costs, there is a higher degree of leverage in this segment and management has a positive outlook on its prospects, provided market conditions do not deteriorate and performance results remain strong.

The increase was driven by a $1.7 billion increase in deposits, $1.3 billion of which were redirected from the Company Heritage Cash Trust or customer brokerage accounts, representing the introduction of a new sweep program for certain brokerage accounts. This alternative offers clients a money market equivalent interest rate and FDIC insurance. The Company intends to expand this offering over the next several years, transferring an additional $2 to $4 billion. During the year, RJBank deployed $1.3 billion of the increased deposits into loans. Purchased residential loan pools increased $700 million and corporate loans increased $600 million. This growth, combined with increased rates, generated an increase in net interest income of nearly $18 million. Pretax income increased only $1.8 million, due to the $13.8 million provision for loan loss associated with the increase in loans outstanding. During periods of growth when new loans are originated or purchased, an allowance for loan losses is established for potential losses inherent in those new loans. Accordingly, a robust period of growth generally results in charges to earnings in that period, while the benefits of higher interest earnings are realized in later periods. 25 Year ended September 30, 2005 Compared with the Year ended September 24, 2004 - RJBank Interest revenue and expense increased due to the combination of balance sheet growth and rising interest rates during the year. As a result, net interest income increased 32% to $23 million for fiscal 2005 vs. $17.5 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in loans receivable was predominantly in purchased residential mortgage loan pools, and therefore did not require significant increases in costs, with total non-interest expense actually declining 2%. This decrease is primarily the net impact of a decline in the provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is associated with the net increase in loans outstanding and the mix of such loans. RJBank has become, and is expected to grow into, a more significant segment within the Company during the next several years. RJF contributed an additional $80 million in equity capital to RJBank in fiscal 2005 allowing RJBank to begin to grow its asset base in preparation for offering an improved deposit alternative for certain brokerage accounts. The Company currently offers customers the option of sweeping their cash awaiting investment to the Heritage Cash Trust (the money market fund managed by Heritage Asset Management) or leaving the cash in the broker-dealer - in the Client Interest Program. The clients will receive an equivalent money market interest rate in the bank account and their accounts will have FDIC insurance.

The segment also includes the investment results from the private equity investments made at the corporate level, including 30 partnerships managed independently of Raymond James and two managed by Raymond James subsidiaries. Expenses are predominately executive incentive compensation expense, which increased due to improved corporate earnings. Statement of Financial Condition Analysis The Company statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for the benefit of customers), receivables and payables. The statement of financial condition is primarily liquid in nature, providing the Company with flexibility in financing its business. Total assets of $11.5 billion at September 30, 2006 were up approximately 38% over September 30, 2005. Most of this increase is due to the significant increases in brokerage client cash deposits, leading to a similar increase in segregated cash balances on the asset side, and growth of RJBank, with the increased loan balances being largely funded by deposits. RJBank loan balances increased significantly as the Company continued to introduce an additional cash sweep offering to brokerage customers. The Company initiated the first phase of this option in July 2006 and plans to continue to expand the offering for the next few years, which will result in continued growth in RJBank balances. The other significant increase in assets was in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The broker-dealer gross assets and liabilities, including trading inventory, stock loan/stock borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and clients fluctuate with the Company's business levels and overall market conditions . Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2006 was approximately $38.9 million, primarily attributable to the increase in segregated assets (directly correlated to the increase in brokerage client deposits), an increase in securities inventory levels, an increase in receivables from broker-dealers and clearing organizations, an increase in receivables from clients, and a decrease in payables due broker-dealers and clearing organizations. This was offset by an increase in payables due clients, an increase in payables associated with the Company stock loan/borrowed business, and an increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Investing activities used $2.0 billion in cash, which is primarily due to loans originated and purchased by RJBank, the purchases of available for sales securities, and purchases by RJBank of securities under agreements to resell. This was offset by RJBank loan repayments and the maturation of available for sale securities. Financing activities provided $1.8 billion, the result of an increase in deposits at RJBank and cash provided from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases. This was partially offset by the repayments of borrowings, purchases of treasury stock and the payment of cash dividends. At September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005 the Company had loans payable of approximately $141.6 million and $146 million, respectively. The balance at September 30, 2006 is comprised primarily of a $67.5 million loan for its home-office complex, a $1.1 million mortgage loan for the office of a foreign joint venture, $60 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances (RJBank), and various short-term borrowings totaling approximately $13 million. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries have the following lines of credit: RJF has a committed $200 million line of credit, RJA has uncommitted bank lines of credit aggregating $485.1 million with commercial banks, Raymond James Credit Corporation has a line of credit for $25 million, and RJ Ltd. has a CDN$40 million uncommitted line of credit. At September 30, 2006, the Company had approximately $13 million in outstanding loans under these lines of credit. Additionally, RJBank had $781 million in credit available from the FHLB at September 30, 2006. The Company committed $200 million line of credit is subject to a 0.125% per annum facility fee. As of September 30, 2006, the Company's liabilities are comprised primarily of client payables of $4.6 billion at the broker-dealer subsidiaries and deposits of $2.8 billion at RJBank, as well as deposits held on stock loaned transactions of $1.2 billion. The Company primarily acts as an intermediary in stock borrowed/loan transactions. As a result, the liability associated with the stock loan transactions is related to the $1.1 billion receivable comprised of the Company's cash deposits for stock borrowed transactions. To meet its obligations to clients, the Company has approximately $3.8 billion in cash and assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations. The Company also has client brokerage receivables of $1.5 billion. 28 The Company will continue its implementation of a new cash sweep option to its clients through RJBank. This new cash sweep option will require substantial capital to be contributed to RJBank to meet regulatory requirements, and therefore may require the Company to infuse an estimated $200 to $300 million over the next several years for this purpose. The Company has committed a total of $42.6 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $2.0 million, to 40 different independent venture capital or private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had invested $29.4 million of that amount and has received $24.8 million in distributions. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company had invested $11.7 million and has received $5.5 million in distributions as of September 30, 2006. Management has been authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase its common stock at their discretion for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. In May 2004 the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $75 million of shares. As of September 30, 2006 the unused portion of this authorization was $67.6 million. The Company has committed to lend to or guarantee obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary, RJ Tax Credit Funds, Inc. ( RJTCF ), of up to $90 million upon request, subject to certain limitations as well as annual review and renewal. RJTCF borrows in order to invest in partnerships which purchase and develop properties qualifying for tax credits. These investments in project partnerships are then sold to various tax credit funds, which have third party investors, and for which RJTCF serves as the managing member or general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments within 90 days of their acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used to repay RJTCF borrowings. Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or advances to project partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which it serves as managing member or general partner. At September 30, 2006, cash funded to invest in either loans to or investments in project partnerships was $28.6 million. In addition, at September 30, 2006, RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings of $7.6 million related to project partnerships that have not yet been sold to various tax credit funds. The Company believes its existing assets, which are highly liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations should provide adequate funds for continuing operations. The Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill their lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge in 2005 to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company also had taken a $4 million pretax charge in 2004 to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represents a cash expenditure; however, in the likely event of a material modification to the lease or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders in fiscal 2007, certain tax payments of up to approximately $8.1 million could be accelerated. The expected tax payments are currently reflected on the statement of financial condition as a deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge to earnings. The Company also has a leveraged lease outstanding with Continental valued at $10.9 million as of Sept. 30, 2006. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of the Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The Company is monitoring this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental obligations under this lease given the difficult economic environment for the airline industry. The Company Turkish affiliate was assessed for the year 2001 approximately US$6.8 million by the Turkish tax authorities. This affiliate is vigorously contesting most aspects of this assessment and has filed an appeal with the Turkish tax court. Audits of 2002 through 2004 are anticipated and their outcome is unknown in light of the change in methodology from the prior year audit and the pending litigation. As of September 30, 2006, this affiliate had total capital of approximately US$6.4 million, of which the Company owns approximately 73%. 29 The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC and the IDA relating to liquidity and capital standards. The domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJA, a member firm of the NYSE, is also subject to the rules of the NYSE, whose requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not to exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an alternative net capital requirement , which RJA, RJFS, and HFD have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions. The NYSE may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. RJA, RJFS, and HFD had excess net capital as of September 30, 2006. RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IDA) and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IDA). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IDA may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or the IDA. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation or at the discretion of the IDA. Restrictions on business activities and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2006 or 2005. RJBank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined). Management believes, as of September 30, 2006, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Critical Accounting Policies The Company financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The following is a summary of the Company critical accounting policies. For a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgments based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the Company. 30 Valuation of Securities and Other Assets Trading securities and Available for sale securities are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. In accordance with SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. The following table presents the Company trading and available for sale securities segregated into cash (i.e., non-derivative) trading instruments, derivative contracts, and available for sale securities: September 30, 2006 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value F inancial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Cash trading instruments $ 464,867 $ 85,700 Derivative contracts 20,904 8,309 Available for sale securities 280,580 - Total $ 766,351 $ 94,009 Cash Trading Instruments, Available for Sale Securities and Derivative Contracts When available, the Company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices, or broker or dealer price quotations to derive the fair value of the instruments. For investments in illiquid, privately held or other securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company uses estimated fair values as determined by management. Fair market value of OTC derivative contracts is estimated by using pricing models, based on the contractual terms and conditions, current market levels of interest rates and volatilities, and other factors. The following table presents the carrying value of cash trading instruments, available for sale securities, and derivative contracts for which fair value is measured based on quoted prices or other independent sources versus those for which fair value is determined by management: September 30, 2006 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value Financial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Fair value based on quoted prices and independent sources $ 745,314 $ 85,700 Fair value determined by Management 21,037 8,309 Total $ 766,351 $ 94,009 Investment in Leveraged Leases The Company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines (Delta and Continental). The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines' ability to fulfill their lease obligations. In the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the planes with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pretax charge in 2005 to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company also had taken a $4 million pretax charge in 2004 to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represents a cash expenditure; however, in the likely event of a material modification to the lease or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders in fiscal 2007, certain tax payments of up to approximately $8.1 million could be accelerated. The expected tax payments are currently reflected on the statement of financial condition as a deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge to earnings. The Company also has a leveraged lease outstanding with Continental valued at $10.9 million as of Sept. 30, 2006. The Company's equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in May 2014. 31 Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of the Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The Company is monitoring this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental obligations under this lease given the difficult economic environment for the airline industry. Goodwill Goodwill is related to the acquisitions of Roney & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James Ltd.). This goodwill, totaling $63 million, was allocated to the reporting units within the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Rather they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment. When available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September 30, 2006, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of RJ Ltd. As of the most recent impairment test, the Company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired. However, changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill. As required, the Company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Reserves The Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount; if not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of probable loss. The Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in "other payables". Such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", and Financial Interpretation No. 14. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the Company; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly, each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply, in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period. The Company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans. Client receivables at the broker-dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. 32 Client loans at RJBank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property. RJBank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by a Creditor for Impairment of a Loan . The calculation of the SFAS No. 5 allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different homogeneous classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans. During the fiscal year, RJBank re-evaluated and implemented changes to the loan loss reserve methodology in conjunction with a revision to the corporate loan grading process. The new loan grading process was revised and expanded to provide more specific and detailed risk measurement across the corporate loan portfolio. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each reserve category include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms; changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss history. In addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent in RJBank unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding. For individual loans identified as impaired, RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. At September 30, 2006, the amortized cost of all RJBank loans was $2.3 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $18.7 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses, including $4 million in reserves for off-balance sheet exposures maintained in Other Liabilities, is equal to 1% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. The Company also makes loans or pays advances to Financial Advisors, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of the Company ability to collect such receivables. The Company ongoing evaluation includes the review of specific accounts of Financial Advisors no longer associated with the Company and the Company historical collection experience. At September 30, 2006 the receivable from Financial Advisors was $89.8 million, which is net of an allowance of $3.3 million for estimated uncollectibility. Income Taxes SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Effects of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS 154), which replaces APB No. 20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Changes in Interim Financial Statements . The Statement changes the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. Statement 154 requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific transition provisions, unless it is impracticable to do so. Statement 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in the Company fiscal year 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its financial reporting process of the adoption of SFAS 154. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) in Issue 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights on the guidance on how general partners in a limited partnership should determine whether they control a limited partnership. This consensus is effective for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed, and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified, subsequent to the date of the ratification of this consensus (June 29, 2005). The guidance in this issue is effective for general partners in all other limited partnerships no later than the beginning of the Company fiscal year 2007. The Company adopted this EITF for partnerships created or modified after June 29, 2005, the impact of which was not material to its consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates consolidating two additional partnerships, which were created prior to June 29, 2005, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. As of September 30, 2006, these partnerships had assets of approximately $44.3 million. 33 In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments." SFAS No. 155 is an amendment of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 155 permits companies to elect, on an instrument by instrument basis, to apply a fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets." SFAS No. 156 amends SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value. For subsequent measurements, SFAS No. 156 permits companies to choose between using an amortization method or a fair value measurement method for reporting purposes. SFAS No. 156 is effective as of the beginning of a company's first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 156 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this interpretation will have on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction ( FSP FAS 13-2 ). This FASB Staff Position addresses how a change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. FSP FAS 13-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this staff position will have on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements ( SAB 108 ). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The guidance is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial reporting process. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of a company's first fiscal year that begins after November 17, 2007. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Information concerning the Company's off balance sheet arrangements are included in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. 34 Contractual Obligations The Company has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with its short and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership investments, commitments to extend credit, and a naming rights agreement (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's commitments). The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year (in 000's): Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long-term debt $128,598 $2,746 $7,911 $3,086 $8,272 $43,469 $63,114 Variable interest entities loans payable (1) 193,647 32,787 13,158 17,984 17,529 22,394 89,795 Short-term debt 13,040 13,040 - - - - - Operating leases 101,766 26,013 21,858 16,860 14,378 8,938 13,719 Investments - private equity partnerships (2) 20,100 20,100 - - - - - Certificates of deposit 255,360 125,622 50,427 36,306 24,885 18,120 - Commitments to extend credit - RJBank (3) 1,112,293 1,112,293 - - - - - Commitments to real estate partnerships (4) 7,600 7,600 - - - - - CSS commitment 425 425 Naming rights for Raymond James Stadium 33,120 3,031 3,152 3,278 3,409 3,545 16,705 Total $1,865,949 $1,343,657 $96,506 $77,514 $68,473 $96,466 $183,333 (1) Loans which are non-recourse to the Company. See Notes 6 and 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) The Company has committed a total of $42.6 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $2.0 million, to 40 different independent venture capital or private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had invested $29.4 million of that amount and has received $24.8 million in distributions. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company had invested $11.7 million and has received $5.5 million in distributions as of September 30, 2006. Although the combined remaining balance of $20.1 million has been included in fiscal year 2007 above, the contributions to the partnerships may occur after that time and are dependent upon the timing of the capital calls by the general partners. (3) Because many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows. (4) RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings related to real estate partnerships. Effects of Inflation The Company's assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. Management believes that the changes in replacement cost of property and equipment are adequately insured and therefore would not materially affect operating results. However, the rate of inflation affects the Company's expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the Company. 35 Table of Contents
