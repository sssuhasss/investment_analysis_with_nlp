MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes ( Notes ) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: Our Business a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; Results of Operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; Accounting Policies and Pronouncements a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; Sales details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; Inflation information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; Forward-Looking Statements cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company historical results or our current expectations or projections; and Market Risks information about market risks and risk management. (See Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: Monster Energy , Java Monster , Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology , Monster Rehab , Peace Tea , Hansen , Hansen Natural Sodas , Junior Juice , Blue Sky , X-Presso Monster , Vidration , Worx Energy , Admiral , Lost Energy , Hubert , Rumba , Samba and Tango. Our Monster Energy brand energy drinks include Monster Energy energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault energy drinks, Monster Energy Khaos energy drinks, Monster Energy M-80 energy drinks (named RIPPER in certain countries), Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks, Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks, Monster Energy Absolutely Zero energy drinks, Monster Energy Import and Import Light energy drinks, Monster Energy Dub Edition energy drinks, Monster Rehab energy drinks, Monster Energy M3 Super Concentrate energy drink and Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drinks in four variants. 37 Our lines of non-carbonated dairy based coffee + energy drinks include Java Monster Kona Blend, Java Monster Loca Moca , Java Monster Mean Bean , Java Monster Vanilla Light, Java Monster Irish Blend , Java Monster Toffee as well as our X-Presso Monster Hammer and X-Presso Monster Midnite coffee energy drinks. In 2010 we introduced the following products: Monster Energy Import Light energy drinks, which are packaged in 18.6-ounce Re-sealable End ( BRE ) aluminum cans (May 2010). Monster Energy Absolutely Zero energy drinks, which are carbonated and contain zero calories and zero sugar, and are packaged in 16-ounce aluminum cans (July 2010). Monster Energy Dub Edition energy drinks, which are packaged in 18.6-ounce BRE aluminum cans (May 2010). Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drink Black Ice which is carbonated and contains zero calories, packaged in 12-ounce sleek aluminum cap-cans (November 2010). X-Presso Monster Coffee Energy Drinks non-carbonated dairy based espresso + energy drinks, which are packaged in 9.6-ounce aluminum cans (November 2010). Worx Energy energy shots, which contain zero calories and zero sugar, and are packaged in 2-ounce wide-mouth polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) plastic bottles (October 2010). Monster Energy M3 Super Concentrate, super-concentrated energy drinks, which are packaged in 5-ounce glass bottles (November 2010). Admiral Iced Teas, a new line of ready-to-drink iced teas, which are packaged in 23-ounce aluminum cans (March 2010). Blue Sky Shots, natural functional shots, which are packaged in 2.5-ounce PET plastic bottles (March 2010). Hubert Lemonades, a line of ready-to-drink premium lemonades sweetened with cane sugar and Truvia brand stevia extract, an all natural sweetener, which are packaged in 16-ounce glass bottles (August 2010). Hansen Natural Fruit and Tea Stix , a line of all-natural, low-calorie powdered drink mixes, which are packaged in single-serve stick packs (February 2010). We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to the DSD or Warehouse segments specifically have been allocated to Corporate & Unallocated. We again achieved record gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in gross sales in 2010 was primarily attributable to increased sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010 (the Advance Purchases ). We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such Advance Purchases. We di d not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. 38 A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster TM product line. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and/or Java Monster TM product line could cause a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Our DSD segment represented 93.0%, 91.4% and 89.7% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 7.0%, 8.6% and 10.3% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Com petitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, our percentage increase in gross sales was 13.7%, 10.7%, and 15.3%, respectively. We believe the decrease in the year on year percentage growth rate for the 2009 fiscal year was in part attributable to the decrease in the overall growth rates of the markets in which we operate, in particular the energy drink category, to general economic conditions as well as higher overall comparable sales levels. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influ enced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in both the U.S. and international economies where we market and distribute our products, an uncertain economic outlook or prolonged credit crisis could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower than expected net sales and profits on a quarterly or annual basis. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, there was significant deterioration in the global and local financial markets and economic environments, real estate markets and construction industries, which we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many retailers of our products. In response to this, we have taken steps to increase opportunities to profitably drive sales and to operate our business more efficiently. If these adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact on our financial performanc e and position in future fiscal periods. For further discussion of the risks to our Company posed by general economic conditions (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers) to achieve maximum demand from consumers for our products. We also utilize prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements, including from television and other well known sports personalities, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams . In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. 39 During 2010, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets, both domestically and internationally. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy drinks. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $240.6 million, $168.0 million and $94.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such sales were approximately 16%, 13% and 8% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are reflected below. Such information reflects sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the customer types listed below. We do not have complete details of such full service distributors sales of our products to their respective customers and therefore limit our description of our customer types to include our sales to such full service distributors without reference to their sales to their own customers. 2010 2009 2008 Full service distributors 64% 66% 68% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 12% 12% 14% Outside the U.S. 16% 13% 8% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 6% 6% 8% Other 2% 3% 2% On October 2, 2010, TCCC completed its acquisition of the North American business operations of CCE, through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of TCCC. The surviving wholly owned subsidiary was subsequently renamed CCR, and currently distributes the Products in those portions of the United States in which CCE previously distributed the Products. Concurrently with this acquisition, a new entity, which retained the name Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. ( New CCE ) was formed, which currently distributes the Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Monaco and Sweden (added during the first quarter of 2011). Our customers include CCR (formerly known as CCE), New CCE, CCRC (formerly known as CCBC), Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), AB Distributors, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi Canada, ULC ( Pepsi Canada ) (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co. and Safeway, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCE (including CCBC up to September 30, 2010) (CCE replaced by New CCE from October 1, 2010), accounted for approximately 28% and 27% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The DPS Group , a former customer of the DSD segment, accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our distribution agreement with the DPS Group was terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The terminated DPS Group territories are now serviced by a combination of TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse segments, accounted for less than 10% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and approximately 11% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. 40 We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: Profitable Growth We believe functional , image based and/or better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks and specialty beverages to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on input supply and production costs. One key area of focus is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues, as well as selling expenses including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses. Another key area of focus is, but not limited to, the reduction of inventory days on hand. Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S., will result in: (1) maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2011 and beyond ( See Part II, Item 7 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 ). As of December 31, 2010, the Company had working capital of $769.3 million compared to $501.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in an overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $229.0 million as compared to $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Principal uses of cash flows in 2010 were purchases of investments, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. Purchases of investments, purchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, payments of accounts payable and income taxes are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See Part II, Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources ). 41 Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our br oad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company future financial results include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; the impact of a slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; maintenance of our brand image and product quality; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See Part I, Item 1 Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing ); costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 12-ounce and 24-ounce cap-can, the 18.6-ounce BRE can, the 32-ounce can, and co-packing availability; the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions; increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; and legislation that would limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or the venues in which energy drinks can be sold. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential for the alternative beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks and teas, juices and juice drinks and enhanced waters; new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; 42 significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; proper positioning to capture industry growth; and broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets.

Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performanc e issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. (See Part II, Item 6 Selected Financial Data ). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009. Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $179.2 million, or 13.7% higher than gross sales of $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea iced teas, increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line and increased sales by volume of our juice blends. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by the Advance Purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter and by decreased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter product line, our Java Monster product line, apple juice, X-Presso Monster product line and Rumba , Samba and Tango energy juices. Included in gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, were $10.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Promotional and other allowances were $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $18.5 million, or 11.2% higher than promotional and other allowances of $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 12.4% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,303.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $160.6 million, or 14.1% higher than net sales of $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea iced teas and sales of our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line. The increase in net sales was partially offset by the Advance Purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter and by decreased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter product line, apple juice, our X-Presso Monster product line and our Java Monster product line. 44 Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 129.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately 19.0 million cases or 17.3% higher than case sales of 110.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2009. The average net sales price per case decreased to $10.11 for the year ended December 31, 2010 which was 2.8% lower than the average net sales price per case of $10.40 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from lower priced products and geographic mix. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $167.5 million, or 16.0% higher than net sales of $1,045.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea iced teas and sales of our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by the Advance Purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter and by decreased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter product line, our X-Presso Monster product line and our Java Monster product line. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of approximately $6.9 million, or 7.0% lower than net sales of $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice and Rumba , Samba and Tango energy juices as well as increased promotional allowances. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of our juice blends. Gross Profit.** * Gross profit was $680.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $67.9 million, or 11.1% higher than the gross profit of $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to production variances and increased costs of goods including the costs of raw materials in the DSD and Warehouse segments, as well as product mix and geographic mix. ***Gross profit see definition above. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $332.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $57.4 million, or 20.9% higher than total operating expenses of $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $15.0 million (of which $2.8 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation) and increased expenditures of $13.4 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs. Expenditures for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs and SAP implementation costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $21.5 million as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the 2009 comparative period included a $4.7 million credit related to reimbursements to the Company of legal expenses previously paid by the Company). In addition, the increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures of $11.2 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $6.2 million for point-of-sale materials, increased expenditures of $4.5 million for allocated trade development, increased depreciation expense of $1.6 million and increased expenditures of $2.2 million for other operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $1.6 million related to the costs associated with distributor terminations, decreased expenditures of $1.7 million for advertising, decreased expend itures of $1.5 million for samples and decreased expenditures of $1.5 million for commissions. 45 Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $436.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $45.0 million, or 11.5% higher than contribution margin of $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, sales of Peace Tea iced teas and sales of our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately $4.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in t he contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased net sales, increased off-invoice and promotional allowances and increased costs of goods. Operating Income. Operating income was $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $10.5 million, or 3.1% higher than operating income of $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million, partially offset by a $57.4 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating income was negativ ely affected by operating losses of $9.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in relation to our operations in Europe, Australia and Brazil. Other Income (Expense) . Other income (expense) was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.1 million from ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to a loss on investments and put option of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss on investments and put option of ($3.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in other income (expense) was partially offset by decreased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2010. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $10.3 million or 8.1% higher than the provision for income taxes of $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective combined federal and state and foreign tax rate increased to 39.3% from 37.8% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the year ended December 31, 2010, lower state tax benefits and the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits that arose in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in tax rates was partiall y offset by the increase in tax benefits resulting from the Domestic Production Deduction. The effect of the valuation allowance and its related impact on the Company overall tax rate increased the provision for income taxes by $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net Income . Net income was $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.3 million or 1.6% higher than net income of $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million and a increase in other income (expense) of $3.1 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $57.4 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $10.3 million. 46 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008. Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $126.5 million, or 10.7% higher than gross sales of $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line and our X-Presso Monster -Hammer energy drink, as well as increased sales by volume of our Monster Hitman Energy Shooter product line and our Hansen Natural Sodas . The increase in gross sale was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster product line, our Lost Energy brand energy drinks, apple juice and juice blends. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth q uarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Included in gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Promotional and other allowances were $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $16.9 million, or 11.4% higher than promotional and other allowances of $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.6% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for year ended December 31, 2009 was slightly higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $109.5 million, or 10.6% higher than net sales of $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line and our X-Presso Monster -Hammer energy drink as well as increased sales by volume of our Hansen Natural Sodas . The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster product line, our Lost Energy brand energy drinks and apple juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were positively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010. We estimate that approximately 1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were attributable to such advance purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Mon ster product line, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 47 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our then existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 110.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 7.3 million cases or 7.1% higher than case sales of 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.40 for the year ended December 31, 2009 or 3.2% higher than the average net sales price per case of $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,045.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $117.8 million, or 12.7% higher than net sales of $927.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line and our X-Presso Monster -Hammer energy drink. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of our Java Monster product line. Net sales for the DSD segment for the years ended December 31, 2 009 and 2008, included $8.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $8.3 million, or 7.8% lower than net sales of $106.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice, juice blends, sports drinks, Junior Juice aseptic juices and our Lost Energy brand energy drinks. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of Hansen Natural Sodas and aseptic juice drinks as well as a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. Gross Profit.** * Gross profit was $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $73.5 million, or 13.6% higher than the gross profit of $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products, which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, as well as a decrease in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster product line, which have lowe r gross profit margins than our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. In addition, the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a decrease in the cost of certain raw materials including certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate. ***Gross profit see definition above. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of approximately $100.2 million, or 26.7% lower than total operating expenses of $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was primarily attributable to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the decrease in operating expenses was partially attributable to decreased expenditures of $5.4 million for out-bound freight, decreased expenditures of $3.6 million for merc handise displays, 48 decreased expenditures of $2.5 million for professional service fees, including accounting and legal costs, decreased expenditures of $2.4 million for allocated trade development, decreased expenditures of $2.1 million for samples, decreased expenditures of $2.2 million for demos and decreased expenditures of $1.6 million for storage and warehouse costs. The decrease in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by increased expenditures of $12.7 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased payroll expenses of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $3.5 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $2.8 million for travel expenses, $2.8 million of increased depreciation costs, and increased expenditures of $2.1 million for advertising. Total operating expenses include costs of $24.1 million, or 2.1% of net sales, and $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net sale s, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy brand in Europe for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in professional service fees are legal and accounting fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matt ers, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.3% and 24.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.0 million, or 79.1% higher than contribution margin of $218.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks and to decreased expenditures of $116.2 million related to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was attributable to sales of certain new products such as our Monster Energy Import energy drink, our Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology product line and our X-Presso Mon ster -Hammer energy drink. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately $5.7 million higher than contribution margin of ($2.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin as a result of decreases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, and by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children ( WIC ) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with certain of our 64-ounce juice products. Operating Income. Operating income was $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of approximately $173.7 million, or 106.2% higher than operating income of $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009 from 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increases in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales were primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $8.2 million and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively; (ii) expenditur es of $1.9 million and $118.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) expenditures for professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($4.7) million and ($0.2) million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.5% and 25.8% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Operating income included operating losses of $6.9 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in relation to our operations in Europe and Australia. 49 Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) was ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $11.5 million from $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to decreased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments as well as a $3.9 million other-than temporary impairment of long-term investments. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $61.5 million or 94.0% higher than the provision for income taxes of $65.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to increased operating income of $173.7 million. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.8% and 37.7% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Income . Net income was $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $100.7 million or 93.2% higher than net income of $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses of $100.2 million and an increase in gross profit of $73.5 million. This was partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $61.5 million and a decrease in other income (expense) of $11.5 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $156.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $212.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $16.9 million of stock-based compensation, $11.7 million of depreciation and other amortization, a $4.5 million impairment loss on investments and $1.7 million of bad debt expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operations al so increased due to a $37.1 million increase in accounts payable, a $9.4 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $12.5 million increase in income taxes payable, a $4.3 million decrease in distributor receivables and a $2.0 million decrease in accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $45.0 million increase in inventory, a $12.4 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options, a $10.0 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $5.5 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $3.8 million gain on the Put Option (defined below), a $2.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $2.6 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations and a $1.4 million decrease in deferred income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $208.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $14. 0 million of stock-based compensation, $5.8 million of depreciation and other amortization, a $3.9 million impairment on investments and a $0.7 million provision for doubtful accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operations also increased due to an $86.0 million decrease in distributor receivables, a $9.3 million increase in accrued liabilities, an $8.5 million decrease in inventory, a $5.0 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, a $3.9 million increase in income taxes payable and a $0.8 million increase in accrued compensation.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of available-for-sale investments and sales of trading investments, while cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of property and equipment and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturitie of held-to-maturity investments and sales of available-for-sale investments, while cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment, and additions to intangibles. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that the Company will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, management considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of our brands. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $23.5 million of purchases of common stock held in treasury. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds of $20.8 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $12.4 million excess tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. For the year ended December&nbs p;31, 2009, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $86.2 million of purchases of common stock held in treasury. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments At December 31, 2010, we had $354.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $288.8 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of the se investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by the U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. A large portion of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by 51 an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed, and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed. The auction failures have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. In March 2010, we entered into an agreement (the ARS Agreement ), related to $54.2 million in par value auction rate securities ( ARS Securities ). Under the ARS Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell these ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest (the Put Option ) as follows: (i) on or after March 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013. The ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective ARS Securities when the auction process fails. During the year ended December 31, 2010, $7.4 million of par value ARS Securiti es were redeemed at par through normal market channels. The ARS Agreement represents a firm commitment in accordance with ASC 815, which defines a firm commitment with an unrelated party, binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable, with the following characteristics: (i) the commitment specifies all significant terms, including the quantity to be exchanged, the fixed price, and the timing of the transaction; and (ii) the commitment includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable. The enforceability of the ARS Agreement results in a Put Option which is recognized as a separate freestanding asset and is accounted for separately from our auction rate securities. The Put Option does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under ASC 815. Therefore, we elected the fair value option under ASC 825-10 in accounting for the Put Option. As of Dec ember 31, 2010, we recorded $3.8 million as the fair market value of the Put Option ($3.0 million current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $0.8 million long-term portion included in other assets) in the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding gain of $3.8 million recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. The valuation of the Put Option utilized a mark-to-model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, adjusted for any bearer risk associated with the put issuer ability to repurchase the ARS Securities in installments as indicated above beginning March 22, 2011, and expected holding periods for the Put Option. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. The Put Option will continue to be adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair va lue, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2010, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $79.6 million (amortized cost basis of $70.7 million). A Level 3 valuation was performed on our auction rate securities as of December 31, 2010 resulting in a fair value of $25.4 million for our available-for-sale auction rate securities (after a $7.4 million impairment) and $42.9 million for our trading auction rate securities, which are included in short- and long-term investments. This valuation utilized a mark-to-model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. 52 ASC 320-10-35 indicates that an other-than-temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security, it must compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, the entire amortized cost basis of the security will not be recovered (that is, a Credit Loss exists), and an other-than-temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred. In the event of a Credit Loss and absent the intent or requirement to se ll a debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, only the amount associated with the Credit Loss is recognized as a loss in the income statement. The amount of loss relating to other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). ASC 320-10-35 also requires additional disclosures regarding the calculation of the Credit Loss and the factors considered in reaching a conclusion that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired. In connection with the ARS Agreement, during the first fiscal quarter of 2010, we reclassified $54.2 million of auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading in accordance with ASC 320, as we have the ability and intent to exercise the related Put Option beginning March 22, 2011. We recognized a net loss through earnings on our trading securities of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. We determined that of the $7.4 million impairment of its available-for-sale auction rate securities at December 31, 2010, $2.4 million was deemed temporary and $5.0 million was deemed other-than-temporary. The other-than-temporary impairment was deemed Credit Loss related. We recorded a net charge through earnings of $0.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment that was deemed Credit Loss related during the year ended December 31, 2010 ($3.9 million and $0.5 million had been previously deemed other-than-temporary Credit Loss related and were charged through earnings for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively). At December 31, 2010, $2.4 million of temporary impairment has been recorded, less a tax benefit of $1.0 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The factors evaluated to differentiate betwe en temporary impairment and other-than-temporary impairment included the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as the other factors included in the valuation model for debt securities described above. The net effect of (i) the acquisition of the Put Option during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (ii) the revaluation of the Put Option as of December 31, 2010; (iii) the transfer from available-for-sale to trading of the ARS Securities during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (iv) the revaluation of trading ARS Securities as of December 31, 2010; (v) the redemption of certain ARS Securities; (vi) a recognized gain resulting from the redemption at par of a previously other-than-temporary impaired security during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; and (vii) an increase in the other-than-temporary impairment of certain auction rate securities, resulted in losses of $0.8 million, included in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010. We hold additional auction rate securities that do not have a related put option. These auction rate securities continue to be classified as available-for-sale. We intend to retain our investment in the securities until the earlier of the anticipated recovery in market value or maturity. Based on our ability to access cash and cash equivalents and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, or uncertainties in the expected performance of the issuer of the Put Option arise, or there are rating downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. 53 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company purchased 0.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $37.68 per share for a total amount of $23.5 million, which the Company holds in treasury. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company purchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $33.10 per share for a total amount of $86.2 million, which the Company holds in treasury. Debt and other obligations We entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank ( Comerica ) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was amended in May 2010, under which we may borrow up to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2012. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying London Interbank Offered Rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2010. Letters of credit issued on our behalf, totaling $0.3 million and $0.2 million under this credit facility, were o utstanding as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the terms of our line of credit, which contains certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $30.0 million through December 31, 2011. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2010: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations $ 57,073 $ 31,834 $ 21,431 $ 3,808 $ - Capital Leases 274 274 - - - Operating Leases 19,188 3,366 9,287 5,680 855 Purchase Commitments 27,369 27,369 - - - $ 103,904 $ 62,843 $ 30,718 $ 9,488 $ 855 Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. 54 In addition to the above purchase obligations, approximately $0.5 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2010, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2010. In August 2008, we completed the purchase of 1.09 acres of land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. In December 2009, we completed the purchase of an additional 2.12 acres of adjacent vacant land for a purchase price of $1.7 million. The properties are located adjacent to our leased warehouse and distribution space. We are examining various options to replace our existing leased head office space, including reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of land. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fai r value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the Credit Loss ) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the se curity before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investme nt fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. 55 Accounts Receivable We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management esti mates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present v alue of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Hansen trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages and the Monster Energy trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. We also own the Blue Sky trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademark over one to 25 years. 56 In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2010, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Amounts rec eived pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are 57 generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to our results of operations. Income Taxes We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the per iod in which such determination is made. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more 58 pronounced with the expansion of the distribution of our products outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Average price per case exclusive of this recognition was $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively. Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented.
