ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2013 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of our revenues by segment and our expenses from a consolidated perspective for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent material to the understanding of segment profitability, we more fully describe the segment expenses per financial statement line item. We believe this analysis will help the reader better understand our consolidated statements of operations. Financial and statistical data is also included here. This section also includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2014 . Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, and an overview of financial position. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW Our 2013 consolidated pretax income was $816 million compared to $514 million in 2012 . The $302 million improvement was primarily due to the $499 million increase in revenues, partially offset by the $8 million increase in aircraft fuel expense and $185 million increase in other operating expenses. Our improvement in revenues of $499 million was partially due to a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million related to the accounting for our recently modified affinity card agreement, where the accounting rules required us to revalue the deferred revenue associated with miles previously sold to our bank partner with a corresponding benefit to revenue. Additionally, passenger revenue increased $237 million due to a 6.8% increase in traffic, offset by 0.8% lower ticket yields. The increase in fuel cost was driven by the 5.9% increase in consumption offset by a 3.6% decrease in raw cost per gallon. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increases in wages and incentive pay, aircraft maintenance, contracted services, and other operating expenses as we grew into new markets and increased spending in IT and other areas. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Accomplishments and Highlights Financial highlights from 2013 include: Reported record adjusted earnings for 2013 , marking our tenth consecutive year in which we reported an adjusted profit.

New Markets In 2013 , we added non-stop routes to our network as follows: New Non-Stop Routes Frequency Start Date San Diego to Boston Daily 3/29/2013 Seattle to Salt Lake City 2x Daily 4/4/2013 San Diego to Lihue Daily (Seasonal), 4x Weekly 6/7/2013 Portland to Fairbanks Daily (Seasonal) 6/9/2013 Portland to Atlanta Daily 8/26/2013 Portland to Dallas Daily 9/16/2013 Seattle to Colorado Springs Daily 11/1/2013 Portland to Tucson Daily 11/1/2013 Portland to Boise Daily 11/1/2013 San Diego to Boise Daily 11/1/2013 Seattle to Omaha Daily 11/7/2013 Portland to Reno Daily 11/8/2013 Seattle to Steamboat Springs 2x Weekly (Seasonal) 12/18/2013 Anchorage to Phoenix 3x Weekly (Seasonal) 12/18/2013 Anchorage to Las Vegas 3x Weekly 12/19/2013 San Diego to Mammoth Lakes Daily (Seasonal) 12/19/2013 27 Table of Contents We will also add new cities and non-stop routes in 2014 as follows: New Non-Stop Routes Frequency Start Date Portland to Salt Lake City 2x Daily 6/9/2014 Portland to Kalispell Daily (Seasonal) 6/9/2014 San Diego to Salt Lake City 2x Daily 6/10/2014 Los Angeles to Salt Lake City Daily 6/11/2014 San Jose to Salt Lake City Daily 6/12/2014 Seattle to New Orleans Daily 6/12/2014 Boise to Salt Lake City Daily 6/16/2014 Las Vegas to Salt Lake City 2x Daily 6/16/2014 San Francisco to Salt Lake City Daily 6/18/2014 Seattle to Detroit Daily 6/20/2014 Seattle to Tampa Daily 9/4/2014 Update on Labor Negotiations In July 2013, Alaska Airlines' pilots and Horizon's flight attendants approved new, five-year contracts. In December 2013, we reached a tentative five-year agreement with Alaska's flight attendants, represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), which if approved, will provide the Company and our employees the certainty that comes with a long-term deal. The results of voting are due February 14, 2014. In February 2014, we reached a tentative five-year agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) on terms of a new contract for Alaska's clerical, operations, and passenger services employees, whose contract became amendable January 1, 2014. Horizon's maintenance store employees, represented by the IAM, continue to work towards their first contract. Capital Allocation In 2013 , we repurchased 2,492,093 shares of our common stock for $159 million under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. Since 2007, we have repurchased 21 million shares of common stock under such programs for $478 million for an average price of approximately $23 per share. Additionally, starting in the third quarter and for the first time since 1992, we paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders, totaling $28 million in 2013 . Outlook Our primary focus every year is to run safe, compliant and reliable operations at our airlines. In addition to our primary objective, we will remain focused on providing a hassle-free experience for our customers, and building a compelling brand to support network growth. Specifically, we will continue to improve our in-flight experience with our cabin upgrade project featuring the Recaro seats with power outlets for every passenger flying our B737-800, -900, and -900ER aircraft. Our biggest concern going forward is increased competition in our markets, from both traditional and low-cost competitors. Specifically, Delta Air Lines is significantly increasing its international and domestic departures in Seattle. We plan to vigorously defend our markets through Mileage Plan promotions, schedule changes, community events, and similar responses. We also continue to focus on lowering unit costs in the long-term so that we can compete more effectively, and increasing fuel efficiency by replacing older 737-400 and 737-700 aircraft with larger 737-900ER aircraft. 28 Table of Contents In January 2014, our load factors were down 0.3 pts compared to January 2013. Our advance bookings suggest our load factors will be down 1 pt in February and 3 pts in March compared to the same periods in 2013 . Our current expectations for capacity and operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Forecast Q1 2014 Change Y-O-Y Forecast Full Year 2014 Change Y-O-Y Consolidated: Capacity (ASMs in millions) 8,325 - 8,375 ~ 4.5% 35,250 - 35,750 ~ 5.5% Cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items (cents) 9.00 - 9.05 ~ 4.5% 8.52 - 8.57 ~ 1.0% Mainline: Capacity (ASMs in millions) 7,475 - 7,525 ~ 4.0% 31,750 - 32,250 ~ 5.0% Cost per ASM excluding fuel and special items (cents) 8.00 - 8.05 ~ 6.0% 7.62 - 7.67 ~ 1.5% RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2013 COMPARED WITH 2012 Our consolidated net income for 2013 was $508 million , or $7.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $316 million , or $4.40 per diluted share, in 2012 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2013 , we recognized net mark-to-market gains of $8 million ( $5 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) compared to losses of $38 million ( $23 million after tax, or $0.33 per share) in 2012 . In 2013 , we recognized a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million ( $120 million after tax, or $1.70 per diluted share) that resulted from the application of new accounting rules associated with the modified Bank of America Affinity Card Agreement, and the effect of an increase in the estimate of the number of frequent flier miles expected to expire unused. ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains or losses or other individual revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because: We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts; By eliminating fuel expense and certain special items from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel continuing operations. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management; Operating revenue per ASM (RASM) excludes a favorable, one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million primarily related to our modified affinity card agreement with Bank of America, executed in July 2013. In accordance with accounting standards, we recorded this item in the the third quarter, and it reflects a non-cash adjustment of the value of miles outstanding in the program. We believe it is appropriate to exclude this special revenue item from recurring revenues from operations; CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance; Our results excluding fuel expense and certain special items serve as the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus the information allows investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; and 29 Table of Contents It is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to those of other airlines. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, and the one-time Special mileage plan revenue item, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2013 was $383 million , or $5.40 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $339 million , or $4.73 per share, in 2012 .

The changes are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,490 $ 3,284 6 Regional 777 746 4 Total passenger revenue $ 4,267 $ 4,030 6 Freight and mail 113 111 2 Other - net 584 516 13 Special mileage plan revenue 192 Total operating revenues $ 5,156 $ 4,657 11 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2013 increased by 6% on a 7.9% increase in capacity and a 1.5% decrease in PRASM compared to 2012 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2013 and larger aircraft. The decrease in PRASM was driven by a 0.9% decrease in ticket yield and a 0.5 point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. Increased competition in the state of Alaska and along the west coast put downward pressures on yield and load factor. Due to increased competitive capacity in our markets we expect pressure on unit revenues, while we expect total passenger revenue to increase. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $31 million , or 4% , compared to 2012 on a 0.4% increase in capacity and 3.7% increase in PRASM compared to 2012 . The increase in PRASM was due to a 1.4% increase in ticket yield coupled with a 1.8 point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The increase in regional revenues is due to better matching the right aircraft with the right market to avoid over-supply of capacity and maintaining yields and load factors. Freight and Mail Freight and mail revenue increased $2 million , or 2% , primarily due to increased freight volumes. Other Net Other net revenue increased $68 million , or 13% , from 2012 . This is primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of $47 million or 22% , as a result of a higher rate per mile sold to Bank of America Corporation (BAC) under our new affinity card program and growth in the Mileage Plan program. Additionally, bag fees increased by 7.8% , and change fees increased by 7.3% , due to increases in the number of passengers. We expect increases in other revenue will outpace increases in passenger revenue on a percentage basis in 2014 as we continue to see the benefit from the new affinity card agreement and the increase in bag and change fees implemented in late 2013. Special Mileage Plan Revenue In the third quarter, we modified and extended our co-branded credit card agreement with BAC. In connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards, we recorded a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to BAC. 32 Table of Contents OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $193 million , or 5% , compared to 2012 , primarily driven by wages and variable incentive pay. Fuel expense remained flat due to decrease in fuel cost per gallon offset by an increase in fuel consumption. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,467 $ 1,459 1 Non-fuel expenses 2,851 2,666 7 Total Operating Expenses $ 4,318 $ 4,125 5 Significant operating expense variances from 2012 are more fully described below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2013 by $48 million , or 5% , compared to 2012 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 % Change Wages $ 791 $ 745 6 Pension - Defined benefit plans 50 57 (12 ) Defined contribution plans 44 43 2 Medical and other benefits 142 135 5 Payroll taxes 59 58 2 Total wages and benefits $ 1,086 $ 1,038 5 Wages increased 6% , primarily due to a newly ratified contract with Alaska's pilots that was effective April 1, 2013. Additionally, we hired 2% more FTEs to support increased flying and other strategic initiatives, such as IT and hassle-free projects. Pension expense decreased 12% , compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets and improved funded status compared to the prior year. Medical benefits increased 5% from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee health-care claims and an increase in the cost of health care services. We expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2014 compared to 2013 on a 3% to 4% increase in FTEs, partially offset by reduced pension expense of approximately $40 million, as a result of having higher plan assets and a higher discount rate related to our benefit obligation. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $88 million in 2012 to $105 million in 2013 . The increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year. We expect variable incentive pay in 2014 to be similar to amounts recorded over the past three years. 33 Table of Contents Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. Aircraft fuel expense increased $8 million , or 1% compared to 2012 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,423 $ 3.19 $ 1,397 $ 3.31 (Gains) losses on settled hedges 52 0.11 24 0.06 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,475 $ 3.30 $ 1,421 $ 3.37 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (8 ) (0.02 ) 38 0.09 GAAP fuel expense $ 1,467 $ 3.28 $ 1,459 $ 3.46 Fuel gallons 447 422 Fuel gallons consumed increased 5.9% in line with the increase in departures and capacity. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 3.6% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2013 was due to a decline in refining margins of 26.7% , offset by the increase in average crude oil prices of 4.1% , as compared to the prior year. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from, or pay to, hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $52 million in 2013 , compared to losses of $24 million in 2012 . These amounts represent the cash received, or paid, net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges. We currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 5.0% lower in the first quarter of 2014 than the first quarter of 2013 due to lower West Coast jet fuel prices and the decrease in premium costs related to our fuel hedge program. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance increased by $25 million , or 11% , compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $14 million increase in lease return provisions. During the year we modified one of our power-by-the-hour agreements and terminated another related to our B737 fleet, resulting in a decrease in expense under those agreements but an increase in engine events and related expense that we are now responsible for. For our B737 and Q400 fleets, we also experienced heavier, more expensive checks, on flat volumes. We expect aircraft maintenance to be slightly lower in 2014 due to lower lease return expenses and the benefits of changes made to our power-by-the-hour agreements. 34 Table of Contents Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $19 million , or 8% , primarily due to the increase in rates from the newly signed Port of Seattle lease. Additionally, we experienced increased rates throughout our network with increased departures and passengers. We expect landing fees and other rentals to be higher in 2014 due to expected increases in rates, departures, and passengers. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $21 million , or 11% , primarily due to more capacity purchase flying with SkyWest and higher rates with PenAir. Additionally, we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling costs, and other services as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used. We expect contracted services to be higher in 2014 to handle expected growth in the number of passengers and transition costs associated with changing the ground handling vendor at a number of our locations. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $11 million , or 7% , compared to 2012 as a result of higher commissions with credit cards and interline commissions related to international routes. We expect selling expense will be higher in 2014 , primarily due to increased advertising and promotional activities related to our brand refresh, and revenue-related costs. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $30 million , or 12% , compared to 2012 . The increase is driven by a variety of factors such as higher professional fees, IT costs, losses on the disposal of assets, property taxes and new uniforms. We expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2014 due to an expected increase in IT spending and higher professional service costs. CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense increased $4 million from 2012 . This is due to the overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier. These three aircraft will be operated by Skywest under a CPA. Partially offsetting the sublease loss was a gain on the sale of equity securities. 35 Table of Contents Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile Additionally, we are presenting our line-item expenses below both in absolute dollars and on an ASM basis to highlight areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity. 2013 2012 2013 2012 %Change (in millions, except CASM) Amount Amount CASM CASM CASM Wages and benefits $ 1,086 $ 1,038 3.23 3.30 (2.1 )% Variable incentive pay 105 88 0.31 0.28 10.7 % Aircraft maintenance 247 222 0.73 0.71 2.8 % Aircraft rent 119 116 0.35 0.37 (5.4 )% Landing fees and other rentals 262 243 0.78 0.77 1.3 % Contracted services 221 200 0.66 0.64 3.1 % Selling expenses 179 168 0.53 0.53 % Depreciation and amortization 270 264 0.80 0.84 (4.8 )% Food and beverage service 84 79 0.25 0.25 % Other 278 248 0.83 0.79 5.1 % Non-fuel Expenses $ 2,851 $ 2,666 8.47 8.48 (0.1 )% Additional Segment Information Refer to the Notes of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. Alaska Mainline Pretax profit for Alaska Mainline was $530 million in 2013 compared to 466 million in 2012 . The $206 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue is described previously, as well as the increased revenues from the modified credit card agreement. Mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by $162 million , driven mainly by increased wages and incentive pay, landing fees and rents due to increased rates and volumes, and other expenses to support our growth in operations. Economic fuel cost as defined above increased due to a 6.8% increase in consumption, on a slight decrease in the economic price per gallon. Alaska Regional Pretax profit for Alaska Regional was $69 million in 2013 compared to $62 million in 2012 . The $31 million increase in Alaska Regional passenger revenue is described previously. Alaska Regional expenses were slightly higher due to additional flying by Skywest and higher rates from PenAir, and increased landing fees and rents due to increased flying and higher rates. Also impacting pretax profit is the $12 million loss due to the overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $20 million in 2013 compared to $24 million in 2012 . CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) decreased due to lower operational incentives being met. The $3 million increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was driven by wages and incentive pay, and an increase in airframe checks and other unscheduled events. 36 Table of Contents 2012 COMPARED WITH 2011 Our consolidated net income for 2012 was $316 million , or $4.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $245 million , or $3.33 per diluted share, in 2011 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods were as follows: Both periods included adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2012 , we recognized net mark-to-market losses of $38 million ( $23 million after tax, or $0.33 per share) compared to losses of $30 million ( $18 million after tax, or $0.26 per diluted share) in 2011 . In 2011 , we incurred $39 million ( $24 million , or $0.33 per diluted share) in expense as part of Horizon's fleet transition to an all-Q400 fleet. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments and other special charges, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2012 was $339 million , or $4.73 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $287 million , or $3.92 per share, in 2011 . Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Net income and diluted EPS as reported $ 316 $ 4.40 $ 245 $ 3.33 Fleet transition costs, net of tax 24 0.33 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, net of tax 23 0.33 18 0.26 Non-GAAP adjusted income and per-share amounts $ 339 $ 4.73 $ 287 $ 3.92 Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 % Change Consolidated: Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 13.12 13.06 0.5 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.64 4.38 5.9 Fleet transition costs 0.13 NM CASM, excluding fuel and fleet transition costs 8.48 8.55 (0.8 ) Mainline: Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 12.09 11.87 1.9 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 4.53 4.27 6.1 CASM, excluding fuel 7.56 7.60 (0.5 ) NM - Not Meaningful 37 Table of Contents OPERATING REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $339 million , or 8% , during 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 . The changes are summarized in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,284 $ 2,995 10 Regional 746 713 5 Total passenger revenue $ 4,030 $ 3,708 9 Freight and mail 111 109 2 Other - net 516 501 3 Total operating revenues $ 4,657 $ 4,318 8 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2012 increased by 10% on a 6.3% increase in capacity and a 3.2% increase in PRASM compared to 2011 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2012 , most of which were to and from Hawaii. The increase in PRASM was driven by a 1.4% rise in ticket yield and a 1.4-point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The increase in yield was due to strong demand throughout 2012, while the increase in load factor was due to adding more traffic in our high density markets. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $33 million , or 5% , compared to 2011 on a 4.4% increase in capacity and flat PRASM compared to 2011 . PRASM was affected by a 1.1% decrease in ticket yield, offset by a 1.2-point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The decrease in yield was due to increased competition in certain markets, while the increase in load factor was due to better matching of supply with demand. Freight and Mail Freight and mail revenue increased $2 million , or 2% , primarily due to higher freight volumes and an increase in fuel and security charges, which offset a decrease in mail volumes. Other Net Other net revenue increased $15 million , or 3% , from 2011 . This is primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of 7% and buy-on-board sales of 20%. Buy-on-board improved due to an increase in food sales of 24% and beverage sales of 14%. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in bag fees of 2% due to general shifts in customer behavior and our Club 49 program that launched in the fourth quarter of 2011, which waives the checked bag fee for residents in the state of Alaska who have joined the program. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $256 million , or 7% , compared to 2011 mostly as a result of higher fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,459 $ 1,298 12 Non-fuel expenses 2,666 2,571 4 Total Operating Expenses $ 4,125 $ 3,869 7 Significant operating expense variances from 2011 are more fully described below. 38 Table of Contents Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2012 by $47 million , or 5% , compared to 2011 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 % Change Wages $ 745 $ 721 3 Pension - Defined benefit plans 57 42 36 Defined contribution plans 43 42 2 Medical and other benefits 135 129 5 Payroll taxes 58 57 2 Total wages and benefits $ 1,038 $ 991 5 Wages increased 3% on a 1% increase in FTEs as a result of increased flying and higher wage rates throughout our different employee groups which have wage step increases in their contracts. The contracts with the different employee groups contain important productivity improvements, which resulted in a 3.5% increase in the number of passengers handled per FTE. Pension and other retirement-related benefits increased 36% primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate on the future benefit obligation compared to the prior year and a reduction in the expected return on plan assets. The impact of lower rates resulted in an increase in our pension expense. Medical benefits increased 5% from the prior year primarily due to an increase in the cost of health-care somewhat offset by lower employee claims, and an increase in workers' compensation expense, partially offset by a decline in post-retirement medical expense. Payroll taxes increased 2% from the prior year in line with increased wages. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $72 million in 2011 to $88 million in 2012 . The increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $161 million , or 12% compared to 2011 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,397 $ 3.31 $ 1,289 $ 3.24 Gains on settled hedges 24 0.06 (21 ) (0.06 ) Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,421 $ 3.37 $ 1,268 $ 3.18 Mark-to-mark fuel hedge adjustments 38 0.09 30 0.08 GAAP fuel expense $ 1,459 $ 3.46 $ 1,298 $ 3.26 Fuel gallons 422 398 Fuel gallons consumed increased 6.0% in line with the increase in departures and block hours. The raw fuel price per gallon increased 2.2% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices. The increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2012 was due to the increase in refining margins of 10.3%, offset by the decrease in average crude oil prices of 1.3%, as compared to the prior year. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year was $24 million in 2012 , compared to gains of $21 million in 2011 . 39 Table of Contents Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance increased by $16 million , or 8% , compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $13 million increase in unscheduled engine removals for our Q400 aircraft and an $8 million increase related to our 737-800 aircraft related to heavier airframe checks, offset by a $12 million decrease due to lighter airframe checks for our 737-400 aircraft. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent was flat compared to the prior-year period primarily due to lower rent expense of $3 million for 13 fewer CRJ-700 aircraft and three B737-400 aircraft lease extensions of $2 million, offset by additional rent expense for three B737-700 aircraft which were sold and leased back for $3 million. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $5 million , or 2% , primarily due to higher facilities rents of $5 million and increased landing fees of $4 million due to increased departures of 1.8%. These increases were partially offset by lower rents at LAX of $8 million. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $15 million , or 8% , primarily due to an increase in passengers of 4.5% and capacity purchase flying of $13 million related to SkyWest, which began in May 2011. Additionally, we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling of $2 million as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used. Selling Expenses Selling expenses decreased by $7 million , or 4% , compared to 2011 as a result of lower fees related to debit card purchases of $4 million and flat global distribution system (GDS) fees, offset by an increase in advertising and promotional activities of $2 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $17 million , or 7% , compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to additional depreciation expense for the annualization of B737 aircraft and Q400 aircraft delivered in 2011, as well as the deliveries of B737 aircraft in 2012. In addition, we incurred depreciation of $6 million related to Terminal 6 at LAX, which was put into service in March 2012. These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation expense for the CRJ-700 aircraft removed from the fleet in 2011 and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage costs increased $12 million , or 18% , from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers of 4.5%, increase in sales of buy-on-board products of 20%, offset by the higher cost of some of our premium products served on board, and increased costs associated with food delivery. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $13 million , or 6% , compared to 2011 . The increase is primarily driven by higher IT and professional service costs of $8 million associated with our key initiatives and infrastructure improvements, and higher personnel non-wage costs such as hotels, meals and per diems of $7 million. Fleet Transition and Restructuring Related Expenses Fleet transition costs decreased $39 million , as we completed our transition to an all-Q400 fleet at Horizon in 2011. CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense decreased $37 million from 2011. This is due to lower interest expense of $13 million on lower average outstanding debt balances and additional capitalized interest due to higher levels of aircraft purchase deposits and 40 Table of Contents capital expenditures. Additionally, we incurred pre-payment penalties of $8 million and an impairment charge of $6 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection in the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by lower interest income earned on our marketable securities portfolio. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile Additionally, we are presenting our line-item expenses below both in absolute dollars and on an ASM basis to highlight areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity. 2012 2011 2012 2011 %Change (in millions, except CASM) Amount Amount CASM CASM CASM Wages and benefits $ 1,038 $ 991 3.30 3.34 (1.2 )% Variable incentive pay 88 72 0.28 0.24 16.7 % Aircraft maintenance 222 206 0.71 0.70 1.4 % Aircraft rent 116 116 0.37 0.39 (5.1 )% Landing fees and other rentals 243 238 0.77 0.80 (3.8 )% Contracted services 200 185 0.64 0.62 3.2 % Selling expenses 168 175 0.53 0.59 (10.2 )% Depreciation and amortization 264 247 0.84 0.83 1.2 % Food and beverage service 79 67 0.25 0.23 8.7 % Other 248 235 0.79 0.79 % Fleet transition costs 39 (a) (a) Non-fuel Expenses $ 2,666 $ 2,571 8.48 8.55 (0.8 )% (a) Included to reconcile total non-fuel expenses.

Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. Alaska Mainline Pretax profit for Alaska Mainline was $466 million in 2012 compared to $375 million in 2011. The $289 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue is described previously. Mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by $162 million, driven mainly by increased wages and incentive pay, depreciation expense, food and beverage expense, and other expenses to support our growth in operations. Economic fuel cost as defined above increased due to an 6.4% increase in consumption, and an increase economic price per gallon. Alaska Regional Pretax profit for Alaska Regional was $62 million in 2012 compared to $68 million in 2011. The $33 million increase in Alaska Regional passenger revenue is described previously. Alaska Regional expenses were higher due to additional flying by Skywest, which began flying in May 2011. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $24 million in 2012 compared to $22 million in 2011. CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) were flat with the prior year. The $2 million decrease in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was driven by cost savings as more overhead expense was transitioned under the CPA arrangement, partially offset by higher engine maintenance costs in the second-half of 2012. 41 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.3 billion , and our expected cash from operations; Our 61 unencumbered aircraft as of December 31, 2013 in our operating fleet that could be financed, if necessary; Our combined $200 million bank line-of-credit facilities, with none currently outstanding; In 2013 , we took free and clear delivery of nine B737-900ER, and three Q400 aircraft. We made scheduled debt payments totaling $161 million . In addition, we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing $159 million of our common stock in 2013 , and paid dividends totaling $28 million. Finally, we made voluntary contributions to our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $83 million in 2013 , although there were no funding requirements. We will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change. The overall strength of our balance sheet was one of the contributing factors for Standard & Poor's recent decision to upgrade our credit rating from BB to BB+, with a stable outlook. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. Our investment portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives, approved and prohibited investments, and duration and credit quality guidelines. Our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 1,330 $ 1,252 $ 78 Cash, marketable securities, and unused lines of credit as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue (a) 31 % 31 % Long-term debt, net of current portion 754 871 (117 ) Shareholders equity 2,029 1,421 608 Long-term debt-to-capital ratio (b) 35%:65% 48%:52% (13 ) pts (a) Excludes Special mileage plan revenue item. (b) Calculated using the present value of remaining aircraft lease payments. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash from operation increased approximately $228 million due to an increase in revenues, excluding Special mileage plan revenue item, of approximately $300 million, an increase in cash receipts related to our mileage plan program of approximately $130 million due to growth in the program and an increase in the rate paid per mile, an approximately $60 million savings in fuel hedges as we changed our program to purchase calls out of the money and shortened the tenor of our program, and approximately $30 million less in pension contributions. Partially offsetting these increases were additional cash paid in taxes of approximately $80 million, an increase in operating expenses to support the growth in revenues of approximately $115 million, an increase wages and incentive pay of $65 million, and an increase fuel costs of $25 million. 42 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million in 2012 , compared to $696 million in 2011 . The $57 million increase was primarily driven by $339 million in increased revenue, offset by higher fuel of $161 million as well as higher non-fuel operating costs to support increased revenues and capacity. In addition, cash received from the sale of miles under our mileage plan program increased approximately $30 million due a 5% increase in miles sold with a 4% increase in rate. In 2012, we made voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan of $110 million versus $133 million in the prior year, and we paid cash taxes of $78 million in 2012 compared to $8 million in 2011. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $698 million during 2013 , compared to $645 million in 2012 . Our capital expenditures were $566 million , or $48 million higher than in 2012 . This is due to the delivery of nine B737-900ER aircraft, and three Q400 aircraft, compared to four B737-900ER aircraft, three B737-800 aircraft, and two Q400 aircraft in the prior year. We now have firm commitments for 69 B737 aircraft through 2022 with options to acquire up to 62 additional 737 NextGen (NG) aircraft and MAX aircraft in 2015 through 2024 . The options for both NG and MAX aircraft will give Alaska the flexibility, but not the obligation, to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met. The new agreements will result in increased capital spending over the next ten years depending on how many of our options are exercised. The table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised, as of February 13, 2014 . These options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met: 2013 Actuals 2014 2015 2016 2017 Aircraft and aircraft purchase deposits - firm $ 487 $ 290 $ 335 $ 270 $ 325 Replacement options expected to be exercised (a) 10 75 60 Other flight equipment 41 130 35 35 25 Other property and equipment 38 95 80 75 75 Total property and equipment additions $ 566 $ 525 $ 525 $ 440 $ 425 Aircraft and aircraft deposits related to growth options, if exercised (a) $ $ 45 $ 190 $ 235 $ 300 (a) Alaska has options to acquire 62 B737 aircraft with deliveries in 2015 through 2024 . Horizon has options to acquire 7 Q400 aircraft with deliveries in 2015 to 2018 . Cash used in investing activities was $645 million during 2012, compared to $403 million in 2011. Our capital expenditures were $518 million, or $131 million higher than in 2011. This is due to the delivery of four B737-900ER aircraft, three B737-800 aircraft and two Q400 aircraft, compared to three B737-800 aircraft in the prior year, as well as purchase deposits for the ten B737-900ER aircraft to be delivered in 2014 and initial deposits related to our new Boeing agreements. In 2012, we entered into a new agreement and modified existing agreements with Boeing to acquire 50 737 aircraft, including 37 of Boeing's new 737 MAX aircraft. This order positions Alaska to replace aging aircraft over the next decade, including the phase out of nearly all of its 737-400 aircraft by the end of 2017, and continue to operate one of the most modern, environmentally friendly, comfortable and fuel-efficient fleets in the United States. Cash Used by Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $325 million during 2013 , compared to $88 million in 2012 . During the current year, we had scheduled debt payments of $161 million , stock repurchases of $159 million , and cash dividend payments of $28 million . In 2012 , we made debt payments of $275 million , stock repurchases of $60 million , and received $178 million in T6 LAX reimbursement. In 2011, we made debt payments of $334 million and stock repurchases of $80 million, which was offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $106 million. We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, along with additional debt financing if necessary. 43 Table of Contents Bank Line-of-Credit Facility The Company has two $100 million credit facilities. Both facilities have variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. Borrowings on one of the $100 million facilities, which expires in August 2015 , are secured by aircraft. Borrowings on the other $100 million facility are secured by certain accounts receivable, spare engines, spare parts and ground service equipment. We modified the first facility in 2012 by extending the term from March 2013 to August 2015 and the second facility in 2013 by extending the term from March 2016 to March 2017 , and reduced the commitment fee for both facilities. The Company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments Overall, we have firm orders to purchase 69 aircraft. We have options to acquire 62 additional B737 aircraft and options to acquire 7 Q400 aircraft. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments by year, as of February 13, 2014 : Actual Fleet Count Expected Fleet Activity Aircraft Dec 31, 2012 Dec 31, 2013 2014 Changes Dec 31, 2014 2015 Changes Dec 31, 2015 B737 Freighters & Combis 6 6 6 6 B737 Passenger Aircraft 118 125 3 128 1 129 Total Mainline Fleet 124 131 3 134 1 135 Q400 48 51 51 51 Total 172 182 3 185 1 186 For future firm orders and if we exercise our options for additional deliveries, we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash, long-term debt, or lease arrangements. Future Fuel Hedge Positions We use both call options for crude oil forwards and swap agreements for jet fuel refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption. We have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50% of our first quarter 2014 estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 70 cents per gallon. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2014 50% $103 $9 Second Quarter 2014 50% $103 $8 Third Quarter 2014 44% $103 $8 Fourth Quarter 2014 33% $104 $7 Full Year 2014 44% $103 $8 First Quarter 2015 28% $104 $7 Second Quarter 2015 22% $103 $6 Third Quarter 2015 17% $106 $5 Fourth Quarter 2015 11% $106 $5 Full Year 2015 19% $104 $6 First Quarter 2016 6% $105 $4 Full Year 2016 1% $105 $4 44 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2013 .

(b) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2013 . (c) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements and obligations associated with third-party CPAs with SkyWest and PenAir. Refer to the "Commitments" note in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Defined Benefit Pensions Our qualified defined-benefit pension plans were overfunded by $60 million at December 31, 2013 , compared to a $335 million unfunded liability at December 31, 2012 . This results in a 104% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 82% funded as of December 31, 2012 . Considering the funded status of the plans, we do not plan on making any material pension contributions in 2014. Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. Deferred Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the majority of our assets, as measured by value, are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated, which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices, level of pension funding (which is generally not known until late each year), whether "bonus depreciation" provisions are available, as well as other legislative changes that are out of our control. In 2013 , we made tax payments of $149 million , and had an effective tax rate of 37.7% . In 2014 , we expect to pay more in cash tax payments, however, this is highly dependent on actual taxable income and other factors that are difficult to estimate at this time. 45 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A are based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our bank partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future. For miles sold to third parties, the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered, and the remaining components are recorded as commission in other-net revenue in the period the miles are sold. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $213 million , $143 million and $138 million , respectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines or expire, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2013 , we had approximately 137 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $656 million . Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in these estimates; therefore, different assumptions could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer sales proceeds under two accounting methodologies: the relative selling price method, which represents approximately 94% of sold miles, and the residual accounting method, which represents the remaining 6%. For contracts that were modified after the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force" (ASU 2009-13), we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed. We estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables. This relative allocation does not change over the term of the agreements. For remaining contracts which continue to be accounted for under the residual method, as our estimates of selling price change, the amount we defer changes, resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period. A 10% increase in the estimated selling price of travel (and related deferral rate) would decrease commission revenue by an immaterial amount. This amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place. 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) consider historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. In 2013 , as part of the modification of our affinity card agreement, we re-evaluated the breakage rate based on a statistical analysis of historical data, which refined our estimate of the amount of 46 Table of Contents breakage in the mileage population. This new refinement enabled us to better identify historical differences between certain of our mileage breakage estimates and the amounts that have actually been experienced. As a result, we increased our estimate of the number of miles expected to expire unused from 12% to 17.4%. The effect of the 5.4% change in the breakage estimate was approximately $44 million, included as part of the Special mileage plan revenue item, and approximately $7 million for the second half of 2013, included in Other-net revenue. A hypothetical 1% change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a $5 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award: We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical award redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners, and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS Accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the changes in funded status in other comprehensive income. Pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $50 million , $57 million , and $42 million in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively. We expect the 2014 expense to be approximately $9 million , as a result of the improvement in the funded status of our plans. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate increases. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 4.85% and 3.95% at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The discount rate at December 31, 2013 was determined using current rates earned on high-quality, long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans. The increase in the discount rate is due to the rising interest rate environment as the economy improves from the recent recession. If the economy were to face unfavorable conditions and the discount rate decreased by 0.5% (from 4.85% to 4.35% ), we would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2013 by approximately $118 million and increase our estimated 2014 pension expense by approximately $8 million . Pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2013 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.75% , which decreased 0.5% from the rate at December 31, 2012 . The decrease in rate is due to the shift of our pension asset portfolio into more fixed income 47 Table of Contents investments that better match the cash flows of our expected benefit payments and reduce the volatility of future returns. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2013 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed-income securities. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 0.5% (from 6.75% to 6.25% ) would increase our estimated 2014 pension expense by approximately $9 million . All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Additionally, benefits in our non-union defined-benefit plans were frozen January 1, 2014. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2013 , we had approximately $3.9 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft.
