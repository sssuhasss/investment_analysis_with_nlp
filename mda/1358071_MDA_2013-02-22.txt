Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. As a result of the acquisitions and divestures discussed below, many comparisons between periods will be difficult or impossible. In December 2012, we sold certain of our non-core assets, a portion of which were acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition, for cash consideration of approximately $488.1 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax loss on this sale of approximately $18.7 million (included in discontinued operations). For the year ended December 31, 2012, these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day. In July 2012, we acquired producing and non-producing assets from Three Rivers Operating Company (the Three Rivers Acquisition ) for cash consideration of approximately $1.0 billion. The Three Rivers Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. The results of operations prior to July 2012 do not include results from the Three Rivers Acquisition. In February 2012, we acquired producing and non-producing assets from Petroleum Development Corporation (the PDC Acquisition ) for cash consideration of approximately $189.2 million. The PDC Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. The results of operations prior to March 2012 do not include results from the PDC Acquisition. In November 2011, we acquired three entities affiliated with OGX Holdings II, LLC (collectively the OGX Acquisition ) for cash consideration of approximately $252.0 million. The results of operations prior to December 2011 do not include results from the OGX Acquisition. In March 2011, we closed our divestiture of our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on this sale of approximately $135.9 million (included in discontinued operations). For the first quarter of 2011, these assets produced an average of 1,369 Boe per day. In December 2010, we sold certain of our non-core Permian Basin assets for cash consideration of approximately $103.3 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on this sale of approximately $29.1 million (included in discontinued operations). For the year ended December 31, 2010, these assets produced an average of 1,393 Boe per day. In October 2010, we closed the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions for consideration of approximately $1.6 billion. The results of these acquisitions are included in our results of operations for periods after their respective closing dates in October 2010. Certain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development and exploration of producing oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We refer to our three core operating areas as the (i) New Mexico Shelf, where we primarily target the Yeso formation, (ii) Delaware Basin, where we primarily target the Bone Spring formation (which includes the Avalon Shale and the Bone Spring sands) and the Wolfcamp shale, and (iii) Texas Permian, where we primarily target the Wolfberry, a term applied to the combined Wolfcamp and Spraberry horizons. Oil comprised 61.2 percent of our 447.2 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2012 and 60.5 percent of our 29.8 MMBoe of production for 2012. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 91.3 percent of our proved developed producing PV-10 and 81.6 percent of our approximately 5,800 gross wells at December 31, 2012. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. 43 Financial and Operating Performance Our financial and operating performance for 2012 included the following highlights: Net income was $ 431.7 million ($4.15 per diluted share), as compared to net income of $548.1 million ($ 5.28 per diluted share) in 2011. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: $105.1 million decrease in income from discontinued operations in 2012, primarily related to the (i) $135.9 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the Bakken assets in 2011 and (ii) the $18.7 million pre-tax loss related to the sale of non-core assets in 2012; $175.1 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A ) expense from continuing operations, primarily due to (i) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2012 and (ii) the acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 ; $65.8 million increase in oil and natural gas production costs from continuing operations due in part to increased (i) production, partially related to acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 and (ii) oil and natural gas revenues that directly increased our oil and natural gas production taxes; and $64.3 million increase in interest expense due to (i) a 62 percent increase in the weighted average debt balance outstanding between the periods primarily related to acquisitions and (ii) our senior note issuances in 2011 and 2012 which bear higher interest costs than borrowings under our credit facility; partially offset by: $202.0 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues from continuing operations as a result of a 27 percent increase in production partially offset by a 12 percent decrease in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities) which were primarily related to a decrease in natural gas price realizations ; and a $ 127.4 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2012, as compared to a $ 23.4 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2011. Average daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 27 percent from 60,180 Boe per day during 2011 to 76,397 Boe per day during 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to our successful drilling efforts during 2011 and 2012 and our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $38.0 million to $1,237.5 million for 2012, as compared to $1,199.5 m illion in 2011, primarily due to increased oil and natural gas revenues offset by increases in related oil and natural gas production costs, interest expense and other cash related costs. Long-term debt was increased by approximately $1.0 billion during 2012, primarily as a result of the PDC Acquisition and Three Rivers Acquisition in February 2012 and July 2012, respectively, partially offset by our non-core asset divestiture in December 2012. At December 31, 2012, availability under our credit facility was approximately $2.2 billion. Commodity Prices Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and NGLs include: economic stimulus initiatives in the United States; worldwide and continuing economic struggles in Eurozone nations economies; political and economic developments in the Middle East; 44 demand from Asian and European markets; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; the effect of energy conservation efforts; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation; the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities; the overall global demand for oil; and overall North American natural gas supply and demand fundamentals, including: the United States economy impact, weather conditions, and liquefied natural gas deliveries to the United States. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2012. Oil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. In general, oil prices were consistent during 2012 measured against 2011, while natural gas prices decreased. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, as well as the high and low NYMEX price for the same periods: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Average NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl) ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ $ 94.19 $ 95.07 $ 79.50 Natural gas (MMBtu) ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................ $ 2.83 $ 4.03 $ 4.40 High and Low NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl): High ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 109.77 $ 113.93 $ 91.51 Low ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 77.69 $ 75.67 $ 68.01 Natural gas (MMBtu): High ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 3.90 $ 4.85 $ 6.01 Low ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 1.91 $ 2.99 $ 3.29 45 Further, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $97.94 and $91.82 per Bbl and $3.57 and $3.11 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2013 to February 20, 2013. At February 20, 2013, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $94.46 per Bbl and $3.28 per MMBtu, respectively. Recent Events Divestiture. In December 2012, we sold certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $488.1 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the disposition of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $18.7 million. We used the net proceeds from this divestiture to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2012, these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day. We estimate that he proved reserves of these assets at closing were approximately 35.3 MMBoe. 2013 capital budget . In November 2012, we announced our 2013 capital budget of approximately $1.6 billion, which we expect will be substantially funded within our cash flow, based on current commodity prices and capital costs. We take a longer-term view on spending within our cash flow, and our spending during any specific period may exceed our cash flow for that period. However, our capital budget is largely discretionary, and if we experience sustained commodity prices significantly below the current levels or substantial increases in our costs, we may reduce our capital spending program to be substantially within our cash flow. 2013 Capital (in millions) Budget Drilling and completion costs: New Mexico Shelf ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................. $ 285 Delaware Basin ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 725 Texas Permian ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 342 Acquisition of leasehold acreage and geological and geophysical data ................................................................................................................................... 110 Facilities and other capital in our core operating areas ................................................................................................................................................................ 123 Total .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 1,585 Credit facility amendment. In October 2012, we amended our credit facility, increasing our borrowing base to $3.0 billion, but maintaining the aggregate lender commitments at $2.5 billion. At December 31, 2012, we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of approximately $0.3 billion, and our availability under our credit facility was approximately $2.2 billion. Senior notes issuances. In August 2012, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2023 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $688.6 million. In March 2012, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2022 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $590.0 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. Three Rivers Acquisition. In July 2012, we completed the Three Rivers Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $1.0 billion. The Three Rivers Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. PDC Acquisition. In February 2012, we completed the PDC Acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $189.2 million. The PDC Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. 46 Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2012, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net asset of $25.1 million. All of our counterparties to these financial derivatives are parties to our credit facility and have their outstanding debt commitments and derivative exposures collateralized pursuant to our credit facility. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments and their collateralization under our credit facility, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. We currently have no reason to believe that our counterparties to these commodity derivative contracts are not financially viable. Our credit facility does not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. After December 31, 2012, we entered into the following additional oil related price swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total Oil Swaps: (a) 2013: Volume (Bbl) ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 369,000 384,000 268,000 200,000 1,221,000 Price per Bbl .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. $ 94.59 $ 94.59 $ 94.55 $ 94.53 $ 94.57 2014: Volume (Bbl) ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 150,000 120,000 545,000 430,000 1,245,000 Price per Bbl .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. $ 91.90 $ 91.90 $ 91.12 $ 90.92 $ 91.22 ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The table below excludes production and operating data that we have classified as discontinued operations, which is more fully described in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from (i) the Three Rivers Acquisition for periods prior to July 2012, (ii) the PDC Acquisition for periods prior to March 2012, (iii) the OGX Acquisition for periods prior to December 2011and (iv) the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions for periods prior to their respective close dates in October 2010. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results.

$ 4.32 $ 5.70 50 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,819.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $202.0 million (12 percent ) from $1,617.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . This increase was primarily due to an increase in the realized oil price and increased production due to (i) successful drilling efforts during 2011 and 2012, (ii) production from the OGX Acquisition which closed in November 2011, (iii) production from the PDC Acquisition which closed in February 2012 and (iv) production from the Three Rivers Acquisition which closed in July 2012. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 16,859 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of 3,413 MBbl (25 percent ) from 13,446 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2011 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $87.96 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2012 , a decrease of 4 percent from $91.34 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2011 ; total natural gas production was 66,613 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of 15,495 MMcf (30 percent ) from 51,118 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2011 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $5.06 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2012 , a decrease of 34 percent from $7.62 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2011 . Our natural gas prices have been significantly higher than the related NYMEX prices primarily due to the value of the natural gas liquids in our liquids-rich natural gas stream. Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses .......................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 182,716 $ 6.53 $ 145,020 $ 6.60 Taxes: Ad valorem .............................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 13,695 0.49 8,854 0.40 Production ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 137,106 4.90 122,187 5.56 Workover costs ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 10,226 0.37 1,868 0.09 Total oil and natural gas production expenses ........................................................................................................................................................... $ 343,743 $ 12.29 $ 277,929 $ 12.65 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 included a $3.1 million ($0.13 per Boe) underestimate of costs related to periods prior to 2011. Lease operating expenses were $182.7 million ($6.53 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which was an increase of $37.7 million (26 percent) from $145.0 million ($6.60 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2012, (ii) the acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 and (iii) an increase in cost of services, primarily labor related, due to the increased demand for services and related labor in the Permian Basin offset by an underestimate of costs in periods prior to 2011 as mentioned above . The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) the $0.13 per Boe included in the year December 31, 2011 related to the underestimate of costs in periods prior to 2011 mentioned above and (ii) additional production from our wells successfully drilled which were completed in 2011 and 2012 where we are receiving benefits from economies of scale, offset in part by cost increases in services, primarily labor related. 51 Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations of our Texas properties and the increase in the number of wells primarily associated with our 2011 and 2012 drilling activity in our Texas Permian area and the Texas properties acquired in the PDC Acquisition and the Three Rivers Acquisition. Production taxes per unit of production were $4.90 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2012 , a decrease of 12 percent from $5.56 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2011 . The decrease was directly related to the decrease in natural gas prices offset by our increase in oil and natural gas revenues related to increased volumes. Over the same period, our per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 12 percent. Workover expenses were approximately $10.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2012 amounts related primarily to workovers in the New Mexico Shelf and Texas Permian areas, while the 2011 amounts related primarily to activity in the Texas Permian area performed to increase or restore production . Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2012 2011 Geological and geophysical ....................................................................................................................................................................... $ 19,927 $ 4,977 Exploratory dry hole costs ......................................................................................................................................................................... 7,518 1,067 Leasehold abandonments and other ....................................................................................................................................................... 12,395 5,350 Total exploration and abandonments ............................................................................................................................................... $ 39,840 $ 11,394 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, primarily relating to our Delaware Basin and Texas Permian areas, was approximately $19.9 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily related to (i) expensing an unsuccessful lateral on a horizontal well due to mechanical issues in the Delaware Basin area, (ii) expensing a dry hole that logged no pay in the Lower Abo formation in the New Mexico Shelf area and (iii) expensing the costs of drilling a well that experienced mechanical issues in the Texas Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recorded approximately $12.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our New Mexico Shelf area. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded approximately $5.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our New Mexico Shelf area. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties .......................................................................................... $ 561,291 $ 20.07 $ 392,859 $ 17.88 Depreciation of other property and equipment ............................................................................................... 12,376 0.44 5,702 0.26 Amortization of intangible asset - operating rights ........................................................................................... 1,461 0.05 1,461 0.07 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization ............................................................................................... $ 575,128 $ 20.56 $ 400,022 $ 18.21 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end ........................................................................... $ 91.21 $ 92.71 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end ............................................ $ 2.76 $ 4.12 52 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $561.3 million ($20.07 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $168.4 million (43 percent) from $392.9 million ($17.88 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2012 and (ii) costs associated with our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012. The increase in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) the properties acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition having a higher rate per Boe than our legacy wells, (ii) drilling deeper, higher-cost wells and (iii) the decrease in the natural gas price between periods utilized to determine proved reserves. The amortization of the intangible asset is a result of the value assigned to the operating rights that we acquired in an acquisition. The intangible asset is currently being amortized over an estimated life of 25 years. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to downward adjustments to the economically recoverable proved reserves associated with well performance on certain natural gas assets in our New Mexico Shelf area, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. We did not recognize any impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2012. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses..................................................................................................................................... $ 118,256 $ 4.23 $ 90,376 $ 4.11 Non-cash stock-based compensation.................................................................................................................................... 29,872 1.07 19,271 0.88 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements .................................................................................................................

The increase in general and administrative expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities, both from (i) increased drilling and exploration activities and (ii) our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012. The increase in general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities and (ii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, offset in part by (i) increased production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2012, (ii) additional production associated with our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 and (iii) increased third-party operating fee reimbursements. As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $14.3 million and $11.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements is primarily due to drilling and completing wells in which we own a lower working interest resulting in increased third-party income. 53 (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth the cash settlements and the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments for the derivative contracts not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2012 2011 Cash payments (receipts): Commodity derivatives - oil ................................................................................................................................................................... $ (22,411) $ 103,969 Commodity derivatives - natural gas ...................................................................................................................................................

To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, and to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 Interest expense ............................................................................................................................................................................................................. $ 182,705 $ 118,360 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility ......................................................................................................................................................... 2.3% 2.6% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes ........................................................................................................................................................... 6.6% 7.3% Total weighted average interest rate .......................................................................................................................................................................... 5.6% 6.0% Weighted average credit facility balance .................................................................................................................................................................. $ 694,984 $ 500,484 Weighted average senior notes balance .................................................................................................................................................................... 2,238,611 1,312,500 Total weighted average debt balance ................................................................................................................................................................... ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 2,933,595 $ 1,812,984 The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the corresponding period in 2011 was due primarily to (i) borrowings associated with our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 and (ii) timing of our capital expenditures. The increase in interest expense was due to an overall increase in the weighted average debt balance, offset in part by a lower weighted average interest rate due to (i) the weighted average debt balance of credit facility borrowings bearing a lower interest rate than our senior notes and (ii) our recent senior note issuances having lower interest rates than historical issuances. Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax expense of $251.0 million and $261.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 38.1 percent and 38.4 percent, respectively. 54 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. In December 2012, we closed the sale of certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of $488.1 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In March 2011, we closed our divestiture of our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million. The results of operations of these assets and the related gain (loss) on disposition are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, described in more detail in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We recognized income from discontinued operations of $23.5 million and $128.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, income from discontinued operations included a pre-tax loss of $18.7 million on the sale of our non-core assets and a pre-tax gain of $135.9 million on the sale of our Bakken assets. 55 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,617.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $766.4 million (90 percent ) from $851.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . This increase was primarily due to (i) 2011 having a full year effect of the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions which closed in October 2010 and (ii) successful drilling efforts during 2010 and 2011, coupled with increases in realized oil and natural gas prices. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 13,446 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of 4,785 MBbl (55 percent ) from 8,661 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2010 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $91.34 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of 19 percent from $76.48 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2010 ; total natural gas production was 51,118 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of 23,771 MMcf (87 percent ) from 27,347 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2010 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $7.62 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of 10 percent from $6.91 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2010 . Our natural gas prices have been significantly higher than the related NYMEX prices primarily due to the value of the natural gas liquids in our liquids-rich natural gas stream. Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses .......................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 145,020 $ 6.60 $ 69,006 $ 5.22 Taxes: Ad valorem .............................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 8,854 0.40 7,156 0.54 Production ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 122,187 5.56 65,041 4.92 Workover costs ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 1,868 0.09 1,896 0.14 Total oil and natural gas production expenses ........................................................................................................................................................... $ 277,929 $ 12.65 $ 143,099 $ 10.82 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 included a $3.1 million ($0.13 per Boe) underestimate of costs in periods prior to 2011. Lease operating expenses were $145.0 million ($6.60 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2011 , which was an increase of $76.0 million (110 percent) from $69.0 million ($5.22 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) 2011 having a full year effect from the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions which closed in October 2010, (ii) our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2010 and 2011, (iii) an increase in cost of services, primarily labor related, due to the increased demand for services and related labor in the Permian Basin, (iv) incurring of higher than normal routine environmental related costs, and (v) an underestimate of costs in periods prior to 2011 mentioned above . The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) cost increases in services, primarily labor related, (ii) incurrence of higher than normal routine environmental related costs and (iii) and underestimate of costs in periods prior to 2011 mentioned above, offset in part by additional production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2010 and 2011 where we are receiving benefits from economies of scale. 56 Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations of our Texas properties and the increase in the number of wells primarily associated with our 2010 and 2011 drilling activity in our Texas Permian area. Production taxes per unit of production were $5.56 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of 13 percent from $4.92 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase was directly related to the increase in commodity prices and our increase in oil and natural gas revenues related to increased volumes. Over the same period, our per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 14 percent. Workover expenses were approximately $1.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The 2011 amounts related primarily to workovers in the Texas Permian area, while the 2010 amounts related primarily to workovers in both the Texas Permian and New Mexico Shelf areas performed primarily to restore production. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2011 2010 Geological and geophysical ....................................................................................................................................................................... $ 4,977 $ 2,712 Exploratory dry hole costs ......................................................................................................................................................................... 1,067 37 Leasehold abandonments and other ....................................................................................................................................................... 5,350 7,381 Total exploration and abandonments ............................................................................................................................................... $ 11,394 $ 10,130 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, was approximately $5.0 million and $2.7 million, primarily relating to our Delaware Basin and Texas Permian areas, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 were primarily attributable to partially expensing an exploratory well located in our Delaware Basin area. The lower portion of this well was deemed not commercial; however, the upper portion of this well was completed successfully. For the year ended December 31, 2011 , we recorded approximately $5.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our New Mexico Shelf area. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded approximately $7.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our Delaware Basin and Texas Permian areas. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties .......................................................................................... $ 392,859 $ 17.88 $ 206,922 $ 15.65 Depreciation of other property and equipment ............................................................................................... 5,702 0.26 3,104 0.23 Amortization of intangible asset - operating rights ........................................................................................... 1,461 0.07 1,461 0.11 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization ............................................................................................... $ 400,022 $ 18.21 $ 211,487 $ 15.99 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end ........................................................................... $ 92.71 $ 75.96 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end ............................................ $ 4.12 $ 4.38 57 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $392.9 million ($17.88 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $186.0 million (90 percent) from $206.9 million ($15.65 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2010 and (ii) 2011 having a full year effect from the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions, offset in part by the increase in the oil prices between the periods utilized to determine proved reserves. The amortization of the intangible asset is a result of the value assigned to the operating rights that we acquired in an acquisition . The intangible asset is currently being amortized over an estimated life of 25 years. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to downward adjustments to the economically recoverable proved reserves associated with well performance on certain natural gas assets in our New Mexico Shelf area, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $11.6 million, which was comprised primarily of natural gas properties in our New Mexico Shelf area and to a lesser extent impairment in value of certain of our inventoried tubular goods. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses..................................................................................................................................... $ 90,376 $ 4.11 $ 59,704 $ 4.52 Non-recurring bonus paid to Henry Entities' employees .................................................................................................... - - 5,059 0.38 Non-cash stock-based compensation.................................................................................................................................... 19,271 0.88 12,931 0.98 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements .................................................................................................................

The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) additional personnel and related costs associated with the Marbob Acquisition, (ii) an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities, partially offset by a decrease in the non-recurring bonus due to the Henry Entities employees (discussed in the next paragraph) and (iii) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation for stock-based compensation awards. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) increased production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2010 and 2011 and (ii) 2011 having a full year effect of the production from our Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions. In connection with the Henry Entities acquisition in July 2008, we agreed to pay certain of the Henry Entities former employees a predetermined bonus amount, in addition to the normal recurring compensation we pay these employees, at each of the first and second anniversaries of the closing of the acquisition. Since these employees earned this bonus over the two years following the acquisition and it is outside of our control, we are reflecting the cost in our general and administrative costs as non-recurring. The final payment of the Henry Entities bonuses occurred in July 2010. As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $11.1 million and $11.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The per Boe rate decreased primarily due to increased production. 58 Loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth the cash settlements and the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments for the derivative contracts not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2011 2010 Cash payments (receipts): Commodity derivatives - oil ................................................................................................................................................................... $ 103,969 $ 26,281 Commodity derivatives - natural gas ...................................................................................................................................................

To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, and to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Interest expense ............................................................................................................................................................................................................. $ 118,360 $ 60,087 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility ......................................................................................................................................................... 2.6% 3.1% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes ........................................................................................................................................................... 7.3% 8.4% Total weighted average interest rate .......................................................................................................................................................................... 6.0% 5.1% Weighted average credit facility balance .................................................................................................................................................................. $ 500,484 $ 617,843 Weighted average senior notes balance .................................................................................................................................................................... 1,312,500 361,250 Total weighted average debt balance ................................................................................................................................................................... ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... $ 1,812,984 $ 979,093 The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2011 was due primarily to borrowings in October 2010 for the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions. The increase in interest expense was due to (i) the October 2010 borrowings related to the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions and the issuance of the 8.0% Marbob note, which was repaid in May 2011, (ii) the December 2010 issuance of 7.0% senior notes due 2021, (iii) the May 2011 issuance of 6.5% senior notes due 2022 and (iv) the amortization of capitalized loan costs associated with debt financing and the Marbob note premium. The proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down our credit facility. The increase in the weighted average cash interest rate is primarily due to the issuance of our senior notes, which bear a higher fixed interest rate than was available under our credit facility. Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax expense of $261.8 million and $101.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 38.4 percent and 40.8 percent, respectively. 59 We recorded an $8.3 million charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 to increase our estimated overall state tax rate utilized to record our net deferred tax liability. This increase in the tax rate is due to an increase in our overall blended state income tax rate, a result of the assets acquired in the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions being located in New Mexico where the state income tax rate is higher than in Texas. Also, in 2010, we recorded a benefit of approximately $1.5 million associated with revisions to our 2009 income tax provision. Excluding the effect of these items, our effective income tax rate would have been 38.0 percent in 2010, which would approximate a more normalized effective income tax rate. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. In December 2012 we closed on the sale of certain non-core assets for cash considerations of approximately $488.1 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. In March 2011, we closed our divestiture of our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million. In December 2010, we closed the sale of certain of our non-core Permian Basin assets for cash consideration of $103.3 million. The results of operations of these assets and the related gain (loss) on disposition are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, described in more detail in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We recognized income from discontinued operations of $128.6 million and $56.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, income from discontinued operations included a pre-tax gain of $135.9 million on the sale of our Bakken assets and a pre-tax gain of $29.1 million on the sale of our non-core Permian Basin assets. 60 Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility or proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 totaled $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $679.0 million respectively. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow expenditures is the timing of payments. The 2012 expenditures were funded in part from borrowings under our credit facility. In November 2012, we announced our 2013 capital budget of approximately $1.6 billion, which we expect can be substantially funded within our cash flow, based on current commodity prices and capital costs. We take a longer-term view on spending within our cash flow, and our spending during any specific period may exceed our cash flow for that period. However, our capital budget is largely discretionary, and if we experience sustained commodity prices significantly below the current levels or substantial increases in our costs, we may reduce our capital spending program to be substantially within our cash flow. Although we cannot provide any assurance, we generally attempt to fund our non-acquisition expenditures with our available cash and cash flow as adjusted from time to time; however, we may also use our credit facility, or other alternative financing sources, to fund such expenditures. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, technological and competitive developments and market conditions. In addition, under certain circumstances we would consider increasing or reallocating our capital spending plans. Other than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise. Acquisitions. Our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties totaled approximately $1.3 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.7 billion during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The significant expenditures for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily related to the PDC Acquisition and the Three Rivers Acquisition. Expenditures for leasehold acreage acquisitions (which are expenditures we generally provide for in our planned capital expenditures) included in the total above was approximately $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Divestitures. In December 2012, we sold certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $488.1 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustment, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the disposition of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $18.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2012 these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day. We estimate that the proved reserves of these assets at closing were approximately 35.3 MMBoe. We used the net proceeds from this divestiture to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. In March 2011, we sold our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $135.9 million. For the first quarter of 2011, these assets produced an average of 1,369 Boe per day. We used the net proceeds from this divestiture to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. In December 2010, we sold certain of our non-core Permian Basin assets for cash consideration of approximately $103.3 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $29.1 million. For 2010, these assets produced an average of 1,393 Boe per day. We used the net proceeds from this divestiture to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. 61 Contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, cash interest expense on debt, operating lease obligations, drilling commitments, employment agreements with executive officers, derivative liabilities and other obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 : Payments Due by Period Less than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than (in thousands) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long-term debt (a) ........................................................................................................................................................................................................ $ 3,104,000 $ - $ - $ 604,000 $ 2,500,000 Cash interest expense on debt (b) .............................................................................................................................................................................. 1,615,162 248,958 369,308 352,278 644,618 Operating lease obligations (c) .................................................................................................................................................................................... 16,824 4,445 7,485 3,205 1,689 Drilling commitments (d) ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 11,951 11,083 868 - - Employment agreements with officers (e) ................................................................................................................................................................ 4,610 4,610 - - - Derivative liabilities (f) ................................................................................................................................................................................................. 13,633 1,584 12,049 - - Asset retirement obligations (g) ................................................................................................................................................................................... 86,261 3,308 19,044 3,426 60,483 Total contractual obligations ............................................................................................................................................................... $ 4,852,441 $ 273,988 $ 408,754 $ 962,909 $ 3,206,790 (a) See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

See Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 62 Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities (including the cash settlements received from (paid on) derivatives not designated as hedges presented in our investing activities) and financing provided by our credit facility. Based on current commodity prices and capital costs, we believe our 2013 capital expenditures budget excluding acquisitions will be substantially funded within our cash flow. We believe that we have adequate availability under our credit facility to fund any cash flow deficits, though we could reduce our capital spending program to remain substantially within our cash flow. The following table summarizes our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities ............................................................................................................................... $ 1,237,478 $ 1,199,458 $ 651,582 Net cash used in investing activities ......................................................................................................................................... (2,240,444) (1,651,418) (2,043,457) Net cash provided by financing activities ............................................................................................................................... 1,005,504 451,918 1,389,025 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents .............................................................................................. $ 2,538 $ (42) $ (2,850) Cash flow from operating activities. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2012 over 2011 was principally due to increases in our oil and natural gas production as a result of (i) our PDC Acquisition and Three Rivers Acquisition and (ii) our exploration and development program; offset in part by (i) the divestitures in 2011 and 2012, (ii) decreases in average realized oil and natural gas prices and (iii) increases in oil and natural gas production costs, general and administration expense, and interest expense. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2011 over 2010 was principally due to increases in our oil and natural gas production as a result of our (i) exploration and development program and (ii) 2011 having a full year effect from the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions and increases in average realized oil and natural gas prices, offset in part by increases in oil and natural gas production costs, general and administrative expense, and interest expense. Our net cash provided by operating activities also includes a reduction of $0.5 million, $19.6 million and $29.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, associated with changes in working capital items. Changes in working capital items adjust for the timing of receipts and payments of actual cash. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we invested $2.7 billion, $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, for capital expenditures on oil and natural gas properties. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially higher during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011, due to (i) our PDC Acquisition and Three Rivers Acquisition in 2012 and (ii) an increase in our exploration and development expenditures in 2012. Cash flows used in investing activities were higher during the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2011, primarily due to the size of the Marbob and Settlement Acquisitions in 2010 compared to acquisitions in 2011, offset in part by the significant increase in drilling activity in 2011. Cash flow from financing activities. Below is a description of our financing activities. During 2012, 2011 and 2010 we completed the following significant capital markets activities: in August 2012, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2023 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $688.6 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. in March 2012, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2022 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $590.0 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. in May 2011, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% senior notes due 2022 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $587.1 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. 63 in December 2010, we issued, in a secondary public offering, 2.9 million shares of our common stock at $82.50 per share, and we received net proceeds of approximately $227.4 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility ; in December 2010, we issued $600 million in principal amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2021 at par, and we received net proceeds of approximately $587.4 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility; in October 2010, we closed the private placement of our common stock, simultaneously with the closing of the Marbob Acquisition, on 6.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of $45.30 per share for net proceeds of approximately $292.7 million; and in February 2010, we issued approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at $42.75 per share in a secondary public offering, and we received net proceeds of approximately $219.3 million. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility . Our credit facility has a maturity date of April 25, 2016. Our borrowing base is $3.0 billion until the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination in April 2013, and commitments from our bank group total $2.5 billion. Between scheduled borrowing base redeterminations, the Company and the lenders (requiring a 66 2/3 percent vote), may each request one special redetermination. At December 31, 2012 our availability to borrow additional funds was approximately $2.2 billion based on bank commitments of $2.5 billion . Advances on our credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (i) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank ( JPM Prime Rate ) (3.25 percent at December 31, 2012 ) or (ii) a Eurodollar rate (substantially equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate). The credit facility interest rates of Eurodollar rate advances and JPM Prime Rate advances varied, with interest margins ranging from 150 to 250 basis points and 50 to 150 basis points, respectively, per annum depending on the debt balance outstanding. We pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment ranging from 37.5 to 50 basis points per annum, depending on utilization of the commitments. In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. Over the last three years, we have demonstrated our use of the capital markets by issuing common stock in public offerings and private placements and issuing senior unsecured debt. However, there are no assurances that we can access the capital markets to obtain additional funding, if needed, and at what cost and terms. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in oil and natural gas companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time to time by our board of directors. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our credit facility. Liquidity. Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2012, we had $2.9 million of cash on hand. At December 31, 2012 , the commitments under our credit facility were $2.5 billion, which provided us with approximately $2.2 billion of available borrowing capacity. Upon a redetermination, our $3.0 billion borrowing base could be substantially reduced. There is no assurance that our borrowing base will not be reduced, which could affect our liquidity. Debt ratings . We receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor Ratings Group, Inc. ( S&P ) and Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P corporate rating for us is BB+ with a stable outlook. Moody corporate rating for us is Ba3 with a stable outlook. S&P and Moody consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Book capitalization and current ratio . Our book capitalization at December 31, 2012 was $6.6 billion, consisting of debt of $ 3.1 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 3.5 billion. Our debt to book capitalization was 47 percent and 41 percent at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.62 to 1.0 at December 31, 2012 as compared to 0.59 to 1.0 at December 31, 2011. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets, and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our 64 reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that we are unable to control or predict. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received, from continuing operations, an average of $87.96 per barrel of oil and $5.06 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $91.34 per barrel of oil and $7.62 per Mcf of natural gas in the year ended December 31, 2011. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004, and that has continued until recently, oil prices have increased significantly. The higher oil price led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs, but also on capital costs. Although we have seen a decrease in commodity prices, the cost trends have not followed proportionally. 65 Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are revenue recognition, the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of business combinations and valuation of financial derivative instruments. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates, as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under this method, exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing properties are sold. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties or projects are periodically assessed for impairment of value by considering future drilling plans, the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 2 to 31 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. 66 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Future Cash Flows This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2012, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with SEC guidelines. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2012 was based on an unweighted average twelve month West Texas Intermediate posted price of $91.21 per Bbl for oil and a Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future net cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this Report as of December 31, 2012 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2012 Standardized Measure on a 12-month average of commodity prices on the first day of the month and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. Our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase, reducing future earnings. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our proved properties for impairment. Asset Retirement Obligations There are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and, generally, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. 67 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows, including cash flows from risk adjusted proved reserves. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions in estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with GAAP, we are required to expense options and other stock-based compensation based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The calculation of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary for using the various valuation methods utilized by us. We utilize the average of the high and low stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards. Valuation of Business Combinations In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must record assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we utilize estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. We make future price assumption to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows were discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rates determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rates are subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future net cash flows of the unproved reserves were reduced by additional risk-weighting factors. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in a higher depletion expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value, or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Valuation of Financial Derivative Instruments In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. In addition, we have used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price-sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties creditworthiness. All derivative instruments are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. 68 Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $25.1 million at December 31, 2012. In order to determine the fair value at the end of each reporting period, we compute discounted cash flows for the duration of each commodity derivative instrument using the terms of the related contract. Inputs consist of published forward commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate. We compare these prices to the price parameters contained in our hedge contracts to determine estimated future cash inflows or outflows. We then discount the cash inflows or outflows using a combination of published LIBOR rates, Eurodollar futures rates and interest swap rates. The fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities include a measure of credit risk based on current published credit default swap rates. In addition, for collars, we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility, market prices and contract parameters. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we reported a $103.9 million non-cash mark-to-market gain on commodity derivative instruments. We compare our estimates of the fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments with those provided by our counterparties. There have been no significant differences. 69 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the FASB issued amendments to enhance disclosures required by U.S. GAAP by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (i) offset in accordance with the current definition of right of setoff or the current balance sheet netting for derivative instruments allowed under current U.S. GAAP or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either the definition of right of setoff or the current balance sheet netting for derivative instruments. This information will enable users of an entity financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity financial position, including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments in the scope of the update. An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We adopted this update on January 1, 2013 and it did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 70
