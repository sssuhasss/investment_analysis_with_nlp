Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business-Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in 34 Table of Contents writing from time to time, are based on management beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and/or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; risks associated with the impact on our insurance program if TRIA, which expires on December 31, 2007, is not extended or is extended on different terms; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual 35 Table of Contents results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on Form 8-K or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, N.J. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non-core assets that have limited growth potential or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors. We continue to believe our corporate strategy of owning and developing high-quality office buildings concentrated in strong, supply-constrained markets and emphasizing long-term leases to creditworthy tenants has allowed us to perform well relative to our peers in difficult markets and even better in favorable markets. In addition, we believe our financial strategy of matching long-term fixed-rate debt with our long-term leases helps to insulate us from rising interest costs and, accordingly, we have fixed the interest rate on approximately 82% of our outstanding debt. The office markets in which we operate showed dramatic improvement in 2005. In particular, our portfolio experienced strong rental rate growth over the past twelve month period in our midtown Manhattan, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. markets and our suburban Boston submarkets. We expect this trend to continue, but its impact on our rental revenues will be felt gradually given the modest magnitude of 2006 lease expirations, some of which reflect the high rents achieved in the late 1990s. In Boston and San Francisco, which make up approximately 74% of our office rollover in 2006, we believe the average expiring rent is between 7% and 10% greater than the current market rents. During 2005, we completed the sale of $838 million of assets while retaining property management on several of the significant properties sold, paid a special dividend of $2.50 per common share in October 2005 and increased our regular quarterly dividend for the eighth consecutive year. Including dividends, we delivered a total return of 23.6% to our shareholders in 2005. Our regional operating teams completed more than 4.1 million square feet of leasing in 2005 while prudently managing transaction costs and non-recurring capital expenses and we increased our occupancy from 92.1% to 93.8%. Other highlights of our 2005 activity include the following: We placed in-service our 901 New York Avenue project, a 539,000 square-foot Class A office building located in Washington, D.C. in which we have a 25% interest. We placed in-service the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts which will provide parking for approximately 800 cars. We continued development on four active construction projects and commenced construction on one additional project during the year, which aggregate an estimated total investment of $317.6 million as of December 31, 2005. In late December 2005, we acquired Prospect Place, a 297,000 square foot Class A office building, for a purchase price of $62.8 million. We intend to invest an additional $8.8 million in this property. Also, in December 2005, our Value-Added Fund acquired 300 Billerica Road, an 111,000 square foot office property, for a purchase price of approximately $10.0 million, of which our share was approximately $2.5 million. 36 Table of Contents During 2005, we adopted an interest rate hedging program. As of December 31, 2005, we had entered into twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the ten-year treasury rate for anticipated financings in early 2007 at a weighted-average rate of 4.34% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $500.0 million. Looking ahead we believe the best utilization of our management skills is in the continued success of our development strategies. Given current market conditions, we generally believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be significantly greater than those we can expect to realize from acquisitions. As a result, we continue to pursue new development opportunities, which is one of our core capabilities. We are also considering alternative uses (i.e., non-office) for some of our land holdings and may participate or undertake alternative development projects. We also expect that allocators of capital will continue to place a premium on high-quality, well located office buildings resulting in lower capitalization rates and higher prices per square foot. As an owner of these types of assets, we are pleased with higher valuations, and in 2006 we intend to selectively sell some of our assets (including large core assets) to realize some of this value. While the amount of gross proceeds that we will ultimately realize from these asset sales is uncertain, the Company expects that the magnitude of the sales in 2006 could be significantly greater than the $838 million of assets sold in 2005. However, there can be no assurance that we will sell any of our assets on favorable terms or at all. Unfortunately, the same market conditions that are leading to record valuations for Class A office buildings and that make significant asset sales attractive to us are also continuing to make it more difficult for us to acquire assets at what we believe to be attractive rates of return. To the extent that we successfully sell a significant amount of assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for the Company to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. 37 Table of Contents We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, ( SFAS No. 144 ) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. SFAS No. 144, which was adopted on January 1, 2002, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. 38 Table of Contents A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; debt to market capitalization; and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenant industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: low risk tenants; the tenant credit is such that we require collateral in which case we: require a security deposit; and/or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or the tenant credit is below our acceptable parameters. 39 Table of Contents We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential loses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1-4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases was approximately 7.3 years as of December 31, 2005. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99-19. Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and 40 Table of Contents acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 121, 125 and 140 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data are comparable. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio ) and the changes attributable to the Total Property Portfolio. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is 41 Table of Contents not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 109 properties, including two hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2004 and owned by us through December 31, 2005. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2004 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2005. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired, placed in-service or repositioned during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Our net property operating margins for the Total Property Portfolio, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses, exclusive of the two hotel properties, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, were 68.8% and 69.2%, respectively. 42 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,176,006 $ 1,147,496 $ 28,510 2.48 % $ 32,247 $ 63,067 $ 26,503 $ 19,344 $ 79,703 $ 40,873 $ 13,094 $ 14,369 $ 1,327,553 $ 1,285,149 $ 42,404 3.30 % Termination Income 11,311 3,982 7,329 184.05 % 9 169 11,480 3,991 7,489 187.65 % Total Rental Revenue 1,187,317 1,151,478 35,839 3.11 % 32,247 63,076 26,503 19,344 79,872 40,873 13,094 14,369 1,339,033 1,289,140 49,893 3.87 % Operating Expenses 403,964 380,678 23,286 6.12 % 12,399 22,706 5,665 4,198 12,884 4,474 3,423 4,271 438,335 416,327 22,008 5.29 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 783,353 770,800 12,553 1.63 % 19,848 40,370 20,838 15,146 66,988 36,399 9,671 10,098 900,698 872,813 27,885 3.19 % Hotel Net Operating Income (1) 17,588 16,985 603 3.55 % 17,588 16,985 603 3.55 % Consolidated Net Operating Income (1) 800,941 787,785 13,156 1.67 % 19,848 40,370 20,838 15,146 66,988 36,399 9,671 10,098 918,286 889,798 28,488 3.20 % Other Revenue: Development and Management services 17,310 20,440 (3,130 ) (15.31 )% Interest and Other 12,015 10,339 1,676 16.21 % Total Other Revenue 29,325 30,779 (1,454 ) (4.72 )% Other Expenses: General and administrative 55,471 53,636 1,835 3.42 % Interest 308,091 306,170 1,921 0.63 % Depreciation and amortization 234,937 220,171 14,766 6.71 % 5,983 12,791 5,497 3,850 18,757 7,909 1,655 4,928 266,829 249,649 17,180 6.88 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 12,896 6,258 6,638 106.07 % Total Other Expenses 234,937 220,171 14,766 6.71 % 5,983 12,791 5,497 3,850 18,757 7,909 1,655 4,928 643,287 615,713 27,574 4.48 % Income before minority interests $ 566,004 $ 567,614 $ (1,610 ) (0.28 )% $ 13,865 $ 27,579 $ 15,341 $ 11,296 $ 48,231 $ 28,490 $ 8,016 $ 5,170 $ 304,324 $ 304,864 $ (540 ) (0.18 )% Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 2,602 $ 3,054 $ (452 ) (14.80 )% $ $ 304 $ 103 $ (32 ) $ 2,124 $ 54 4,829 3,380 1,449 42.87 % Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ 1,908 $ 3,344 1,908 3,344 (1,436 ) (42.95 )% Minority interests in property partnerships 6,017 4,685 1,332 28.43 % Minority interest in Operating Partnership (74,103 ) (67,743 ) (6,360 ) 9.39 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 151,884 8,149 143,735 1,763.84 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 47,656 27,338 20,318 74.32 % Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest (4,223 ) (4,223 ) (100.0 )% Net Income available to common shareholders $ 438,292 $ 284,017 $ 154,275 54.32 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 41. 43 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of $42.4 million in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $38.8 million, Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $28.5 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $7.2 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $30.8 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $1.3 million. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, and the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development in the fourth quarter of 2005 as detailed below: Property Date Placed-in- service Rental Revenue for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 69,608 $ 36,470 $ 33,138 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 9,683 4,403 5,280 Cambridge Center West Garage 4 th Quarter 2005 412 412 Total $ 79,703 $ 40,873 $ 38,830 Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $28.5 million from 2004. Included in rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $8.9 million due to increases in our occupancy from 92.1% on December 31, 2004 to 93.8% on December 31, 2005 which was offset by a roll-down in market rents. Straight-line rent increased approximately $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants attributed to higher operating expenses. With respect to leases that expire during the next year, we anticipate that occupancy will continue to increase which will be offset by a roll-down of approximately 5% to 6% on the estimated market rents. We currently expect net operating income from the Same Property Portfolio to increase up to 2% in 2006 compared to 2005. The acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 1330 Connecticut Avenue on April 1, 2004 and the purchase of the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street on March 24, 2004 increased revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $7.2 million, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Rental Revenue for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 $ 14,860 $ 10,870 $ 3,990 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 11,614 8,474 3,140 Prospect Place December 30, 2005 29 29 Total $ 26,503 $ 19,344 $ 7,159 44 Table of Contents The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of Embarcadero Center West Tower, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street during 2005, and Hilltop Office Center during 2004. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property. Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $30.8 million, as detailed below: Property Date Sold Rental Revenue for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Embarcadero Center West Tower December 14, 2005 $ 15,081 $ 17,837 $ (2,756 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005 8,760 23,488 (14,728 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005 8,406 21,602 (13,196 ) Hilltop Office Center February 4, 2004 140 (140 ) Total $ 32,247 $ 63,067 $ (30,820 ) In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property totaling approximately 397,000 square feet. The project entails removing a three-story low-rise section of the property comprised of 100,000 square feet from in-service status and developing it into a 10-story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately 610,000 square feet upon completion. This property is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Rental revenue has decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to taking the three-story low-rise section out of service in September 2004. Termination Income Termination income for year ended December 31, 2005 was related to twenty-three tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $11.5 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to nineteen tenants totaling $4.0 million. During 2005 we completed several leasing transactions which involved taking space back from tenants with resulting termination income and releasing the space at higher rents. We currently anticipate realizing approximately $4.0 million in termination income for the year ended 2006. Operating Expenses The $22.0 million increase in property operating expenses in the Total Property Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $23.3 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.4 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $1.4 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $10.3 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $0.8 million. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $10.2 million, an increase of approximately 14% over the prior year utility expense. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $7.9 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, with approximately half of this increase specifically attributed to properties located in New York City. The remaining $5.2 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses are related to an increase to repairs and maintenance. 45 Table of Contents We placed in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004 and the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development in the fourth quarter of 2005 increasing operating expenses by approximately $8.4 million as detailed below: Property Date Placed-in- service Operating Expenses for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 11,168 $ 4,053 $ 7,115 New Dominion Technology Park Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 1,595 421 1,174 West Garage 4 th Quarter 2005 121 121 Total $ 12,884 $ 4,474 $ 8,410 In addition, approximately $1.4 million of the increase in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the acquisitions of Prospect Place at the end of 2005 as well as our acquisitions in 2004 of 1330 Connecticut Avenue and the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Operating Expenses for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 $ 4,220 $ 2,986 $ 1,234 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 1,427 1,212 215 Prospect Place December 30, 2005 18 18 Total $ 5,665 $ 4,198 $ 1,467 A decrease of approximately $10.3 million in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses relates to the sales of Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, and Hilltop Office Center in 2004, as detailed below: Property Date Sold Operating Expenses for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Embarcadero Center West Tower December 14, 2005 $ 6,516 $ 6,866 $ (350 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005 3,019 8,039 (5,020 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005 2,864 7,764 (4,900 ) Hilltop Office Center February 4, 2004 37 (37 ) Total $ 12,399 $ 22,706 $ (10,307 ) We continue to review and monitor the impact of rising insurance costs and energy costs, as well as other factors, on our operating budgets for fiscal year 2006. Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties increased by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 the Residence Inn by Marriott was included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on November 4, 2005. We expect the two remaining hotels to contribute in the aggregate between approximately $20.0 million and $21.0 million of net operating income in 2006. 46 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. This information excludes the Residence Inn by Marriott due to its sale on November 4, 2005. 2005 2004 Percentage Change Occupancy 77.4 % 80.0 % (3.2 )% Average daily rate $ 197.82 $ 185.42 6.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 153.95 $ 149.04 3.3 % Development and Management Services Our third-party fee income decreased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 due to the completion of third-party development projects at the National Institute of Health in Washington, D.C. and near completion of our project at 90 Church Street in New York City, partially offset by maintaining management contracts in connection with certain of our asset sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, development fees decreased approximately $4.9 million, offset by an increase in management fees and service income of approximately $1.8 million. We expect our third-party management and development fee income in 2006 to be between $13.0 million and $15.0 million. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In the first quarter of 2004 we recognized a net amount of approximately $7.0 million of other income in connection with the termination by a third-party of an agreement to enter into a ground lease with us. Excluding this termination, interest and other income increased approximately $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher cash balances as well as higher interest rates during 2005 compared to 2004. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Approximately $2.2 million of the increase was attributable to changes in the form of long-term equity-based compensation, as further described below. In addition, there was an overall increase to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2005. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.8 million attributable to a refund of prior year state taxes based on income and net worth as a result of changes to a state tax law. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 and beyond, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense associated with $6.1 million of equity-based compensation that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vests over a five-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2004 and approximately $11.4 47 Table of Contents million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. To the extent we continue to grant restricted stock and/or LTIP Unit awards, our expense will continue to increase significantly until 2008 even if there are no future increases in the aggregate value of restricted equity granted each year. This is because we expense the value of the restricted stock and LTIP Unit awards ratably over the five-year vesting period and a full run-rate will not be achieved until 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. The majority of the increases/decreases are due to (1) the cessation of interest capitalization at Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two, which increased interest expense by $14.9 million, and (2) the assumption of debt in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue in the second quarter of 2004, which increased interest expense by $1.3 million. These increases were offset by (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, as well as Embarcadero Center West Tower in October 2005, which decreased interest expense by $9.7 million, and (2) the repayment of mortgage debt at One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive buildings in the beginning of 2004 which decreased interest expense by $1.4 million. In addition, the impact of refinancing our fixed rate debt collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue using borrowings under our unsecured line at a lower interest rate decreased interest expense approximately $3.0 million. At December 31, 2005, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans on our Times Square Tower, Capital Gallery Expansion and Seven Cambridge Center construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004: December 31, 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,952,151 $ 4,588,024 Variable rate 874,103 423,790 Total $ 4,826,254 $ 5,011,814 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 81.89 % 91.54 % Variable rate 18.11 % 8.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.70 % 6.66 % Variable rate 4.96 % 3.36 % Total 6.39 % 6.38 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Depreciation and amortization from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $10.8 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $1.6 million, The Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $14.8 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $6.8 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $3.3 million. In connection with the redevelopment project at Capital Gallery, which is classified as Properties Repositioned, we recognized an accelerated depreciation charge of approximately $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2004 representing the net book value of the portion of the three-story, low-rise section of the building being redeveloped. 48 Table of Contents The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through acquisitions increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $1.6 million, as detailed below: Property Acquired Depreciation and Amortization for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 $ 3,470 $ 2,292 1,178 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 2,027 1,558 469 Total $ 5,497 $ 3,850 $ 1,647 The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through placing properties in-service increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $10.8 million, as detailed below: Property Placed in-service Depreciation and Amortization for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 16,957 $ 7,066 $ 9,891 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 1,706 843 863 West Garage 4 th Quarter 2005 94 94 Total $ 18,757 $ 7,909 $ 10,848 Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $5.9 million. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $5.7 million and $10.8 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. During the third quarter of 2004, we placed in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two development projects and ceased capitalizing the related interest in accordance with our capitalization policy. Losses from early extinguishments of debt For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $12.9 million. In connection with the sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss from early extinguishment of debt which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan which is included in Properties placed in-service, as well as the modification of our unsecured line of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $6.3 million related to the repayments of our mortgage loans collateralized by One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive buildings. 49 Table of Contents Joint Ventures During the first quarter of 2005, we placed in-service 901 New York Avenue, a 539,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington, D.C., in which we have a 25% ownership interest. The addition of this property contributed approximately $2.1 million to joint venture income for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of March 1, 2006, this property is 99.3% leased. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Property Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during 2005 and 2004 which are no longer included in our operations as of December 31, 2005. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Old Federal Reserve Old Federal Reserve 40-46 Harvard Street 40-46 Harvard Street Residence Inn by Marriott Residence Inn by Marriott Sugarland Business Park-Building One 204 Second Avenue 560 Forbes Boulevard Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven 38 Cabot Boulevard The Arboretum 430 Rozzi Place Sugarland Business Park-Building Two Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza, 100 East Pratt Street and Embarcadero Center West Tower which are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. Also included in gains on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 is the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Hilltop Office Center and a land parcel in Burlington, MA. Hilltop Office Center is not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of this property after the sale. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Properties included in our gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio are shown below: Year ended December 31, 2005 Date Disposed Year ended December 31, 2004 Date Disposed Old Federal Reserve April 2005 430 Rozzi Place January 2004 Residence Inn by Marriott November 2005 Sugarland Business Park-Building Two February 2004 40-46 Harvard Street November 2005 Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven April 2004 The Arboretum April 2004 38 Cabot Boulevard May 2004 Sugarland Business Park-Building One August 2004 204 Second Avenue September 2004 560 Forbes Boulevard December 2004 50 Table of Contents Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership increased $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In connection with the special cash dividend paid to holders of common stock on October 31, 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate in the distribution on an as-converted basis with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in the minority interest in our Operating Partnership income allocation related to changes in the partnership ownership interests and an underlying change in allocable income. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. At December 31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including two hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2003 and owned by us through December 31, 2004. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2003 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2004. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired, placed in-service or repositioned for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our net property operating margins for the Total Property Portfolio, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses, exclusive of the two hotel properties, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, were 69.2% and 68.8%, respectively. 51 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,142,012 $ 1,139,919 $ 2,093 0.18 % $ 140 $ 4,532 $ 77,893 $ 24,796 $ 50,735 $ 9,455 $ 14,369 $ 16,457 $ 1,285,149 $ 1,195,159 $ 89,990 7.53 % Termination Income 3,724 6,136 (2,412 ) (39.31 )% 267 3,991 6,136 (2,145 ) (34.96 )% Total Rental Revenue 1,145,736 1,146,055 (319 ) (0.03 )% 140 4,532 78,160 24,796 50,735 9,455 14,369 16,457 1,289,140 1,201,295 87,845 7.31 % Operating Expenses 387,404 381,231 6,173 1.62 % 37 1,221 17,416 5,078 7,199 2,230 4,271 4,205 416,327 393,965 22,362 5.68 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 758,332 764,824 (6,492 ) (0.85 )% 103 3,311 60,744 19,718 43,536 7,225 10,098 12,252 872,813 807,330 65,483 8.11 % Hotel Net Operating Income 16,985 14,792 2,193 14.83 % 16,985 14,792 2,193 14.83 % Consolidated Net Operating Income 775,317 779,616 (4,299 ) (0.55 )% 103 3,311 60,744 19,718 43,536 7,225 10,098 12,252 889,798 822,122 67,676 8.23 % Other Revenue: Development and Management services 20,440 17,332 3,108 17.93 % Interest and Other 10,339 3,014 7,325 243.03 % Total Other Revenue 30,779 20,346 10,433 51.28 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 53,636 45,359 8,277 18.25 % Interest 306,170 299,436 6,734 2.25 % Depreciation and amortization 214,765 195,351 19,414 9.94 % 21 518 18,935 6,452 11,000 2,506 4,928 1,859 249,649 206,686 42,963 20.79 % Net derivative losses 1,038 (1,038 ) (100.0 )% Losses from early extinguishments of debt 6,258 1,474 4,784 324.56 % Total Other Expenses 214,765 195,351 19,414 9.94 % 21 518 18,935 6,452 11,000 2,506 4,928 1,859 615,713 553,993 61,720 11.14 % Income before minority interests $ 560,552 $ 584,265 $ (23,713 ) (4.06 )% $ 82 $ 2,793 $ 41,809 $ 13,266 $ 32,536 $ 4,719 $ 5,170 $ 10,393 $ 304,864 $ 288,475 $ 16,389 5.68 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 3,054 $ 1,903 $ 1,151 60.49 % $ 304 $ 4,113 $ (33 ) $ $ 55 $ $ $ $ 3,380 $ 6,016 $ (2,636 ) (43.82 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ 2,103 $ 4,823 $ (2,720 ) (56.39 )% $ 1,241 $ 6,102 3,344 10,925 (7,581 ) (69.39 )% Minority interests in property partnerships 4,685 1,827 2,858 156.43 % Minority interest in Operating Partnership (67,743 ) (72,729 ) 4,986 (6.86 )% Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 8,149 57,574 (49,425 ) (85.85 )% Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 27,338 73,234 (45,896 ) (62.67 )% Net Income available to common shareholders $ 284,017 $ 365,322 $ (81,305 ) (22.26 )% For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 41. 52 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of $90.0 million in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio. Rental Revenue from Properties Acquired increased approximately $53.1 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $41.3 million, Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $2.1 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $4.4 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $2.1 million. Increased rental revenue from Properties Acquired relates to the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square as of April 1, 2003, the remaining interests in One and Two Freedom Square as of August 5, 2003, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue on October 8, 2003, the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street as of March 24, 2004 and the acquisition of 1330 Connecticut Avenue on April 1, 2004. These additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately $53.1 million, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Revenue for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 $ 29,938 $ 11,731 $ 18,207 1333 New Hampshire Avenue October 8, 2003 15,480 3,524 11,956 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 13,131 9,541 3,590 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 10,870 10,870 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 8,474 8,474 Total $ 77,893 $ 24,796 $ 53,097 In addition, the placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased revenue by approximately $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as detailed below: Property Date Placed-in- service Revenue for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 36,470 $ 2,463 $ 34,007 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1 st Quarter 2003 6,599 4,613 1,986 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 4,403 4,403 Shaws Supermarket 2 nd Quarter 2003 3,263 2,379 884 Total $ 50,735 $ 9,455 $ 41,280 The increase in rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio reflects an increase in rental revenue, including operating income, parking and other income, of approximately $9.8 million offset by a decrease in straight-line rents of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. 53 Table of Contents The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset due to the sale of Hilltop Office Center during 2004 and 2300 N Street during 2003. Due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties through agreements with the buyers, the properties are not categorized as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue from properties sold decreased by approximately $4.4 million, as detailed below: Property Date Sold Revenue for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Hilltop Office Center February 4, 2004 140 1,600 (1,460 ) 2300 N Street March 18, 2003 2,932 (2,932 ) Total $ 140 $ 4,532 (4,392 ) In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property totaling approximately 397,000 square feet. The project entails removing a three-story low-rise section of the property comprised of 100,000 square feet from in-service status and developing it into a 10-story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately 610,000 square feet upon completion. This property is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Rental revenue has decreased for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to taking the three-story low-rise section out of service in September 2004. Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was related to nineteen tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $4.0 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to nineteen tenants totaling $6.1 million. Operating Expenses The increase of $22.4 million in property operating expenses in the Total Property Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses from Properties Acquired increased approximately $12.4 million, Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.2 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $5.0 million, and Properties Sold decreased approximately $1.2 million. Approximately $12.4 million of the increase in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the additions of One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Operating Expenses for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 $ 6,901 $ 2,499 $ 4,402 1333 New Hampshire Avenue October 8, 2003 3,541 640 2,901 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 2,986 2,986 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 2,775 1,939 836 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 1,213 1,213 Total $ 17,416 $ 5,078 $ 12,338 54 Table of Contents Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.2 million. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase to real estate tax expense of approximately $7.4 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, specifically in New York City. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $1.2 million to insurance expense. In addition, the placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased operating expenses by approximately $5.0 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed-in- service Operating Expenses for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 4,054 $ $ 4,054 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1 st Quarter 2003 2,360 2,022 338 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 421 421 Shaws Supermarket 2 nd Quarter 2003 364 208 156 Total $ 7,199 $ 2,230 $ 4,969 The aggregate increase in operating expenses was offset due to the sale of Hilltop Office Center during 2004 and 2300 N Street during 2003. Due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties through agreements with the buyers, the properties are not categorized as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Expenses from properties sold decreased by approximately $1.2 million, as detailed below: Property Date Sold Operating Expenses for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Hilltop Office Center February 4, 2004 37 336 (299 ) 2300 N Street March 18, 2003 885 (885 ) Total $ 37 $ 1,221 (1,184 ) Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties increased by approximately $2.2 million, or approximately 14.83%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 net operating income for the Residence Inn by Marriott was included as part of income from discontinued operations due to its sale on November 4, 2005. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. This information excludes the Residence Inn by Marriott due to its inclusion within income from discontinued operations. 2004 2003 Increase Occupancy 80.0 % 76.3 % 4.8 % Average daily rate $ 185.42 $ 177.71 4.3 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 149.04 $ 136.41 9.3 % 55 Table of Contents Development and Management Services Our third-party fee income increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended 2004 compared to 2003. Our third-party fees in Washington, D.C. with National Institute of Health and in New York at 90 Church Street increased development services by an aggregate of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our management fees increased approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the first quarter of 2004 we recognized a net amount of approximately $7.0 million in connection with the termination by a third-party of an agreement to enter into a ground lease with us. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, we had a cash balance of approximately $239.3 million which also contributed to higher interest earnings. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the Total Property Portfolio increased by $8.3 million, or 18.25% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. An aggregate of approximately $1.8 million of the increase is attributable to changes in the form of long-term equity-based compensation, as further described below. During the fourth quarter we exercised our right to terminate the purchase agreement to acquire the 21-acre site on the Boston waterfront known as Fan Pier. In conjunction with the termination, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of general and administrative expense consisting of our share of the forfeited deposit of $0.8 million and approximately $0.3 million of related due diligence costs. In addition, we recognized an expense of $0.75 million representing our payment to Mr. Alan B. Landis, a former director, in connection with the amendment to a development agreement. Other major increases during 2004 included the following: (1) increases in state taxes based on income and net worth of approximately $1.2 million; (2) increases of approximately $0.8 million in professional fees in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as fees related to increased responsibilities of our Board of Directors; and (3) an increase of approximately $2.3 million related to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2004. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 and beyond, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Stock-based compensation expense associated with $6.1 million of restricted stock that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million granted in January 2004 and approximately $11.4 million granted in January 2005 of restricted stock and LTIP units will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. To the extent we continue to grant restricted stock and LTIP awards, our expenses will continue to increase significantly until 2008 even if there are no future increases in the aggregate value of restricted equity granted each year. This is because we expense the value of the restricted stock and LTIP awards ratably over the five-year vesting period and a full run-rate will not be achieved until 2008. 56 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.7 million. The majority of the increases/decreases are due to (1) the cessation of interest capitalization at Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two, which collectively increased interest expense by approximately $7.2 million, and (2) the acquisition of our remaining interests in 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue in the second quarter of 2004 and the acquisition of our remaining interest in one Freedom Square in the third quarter of 2003 which increased interest expense by approximately $7.7 million. These increases were offset by (1) the refinancing of outstanding mortgage indebtedness at Reservoir Place in the second quarter of 2003 and 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard in the third quarter of 2003 which decreased interest expense by approximately $3.8 million, and (2) the net impact of replacing outstanding mortgage debt collateralized by properties using proceeds from our unsecured senior notes which decreased interest expense approximately $1.3 million. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2004 compared with 2003. December 31, 2004 2003 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 4,588,024 $ 4,566,188 Variable rate 423,790 438,532 Total $ 5,011,814 $ 5,004,720 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.54 % 91.24 % Variable rate 8.46 % 8.76 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.66 % 6.67 % Variable rate 3.36 % 2.87 % Total 6.38 % 6.33 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Depreciation and amortization from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $19.4 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $12.5 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.5 million, Properties Repositioned increased approximately $3.1 million and Properties Sold decreased approximately $0.5 million. The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through acquisitions increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $12.5 million, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Depreciation and Amortization for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2004 $ 7,435 $ 3,004 $ 4,431 1333 New Hampshire Avenue October 8, 2003 4,287 1,139 3,148 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2004 3,364 2,309 1,055 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 2,292 2,292 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 1,557 1,557 Total $ 18,935 $ 6,452 $ 12,483 57 Table of Contents The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through placing properties in-service increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $8.5 million, as detailed below: Property Placed in-service Depreciation and Amortization for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 7,066 7,066 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1 st Quarter 2003 2,549 2,152 397 Shaws Supermarket 2 nd Quarter 2003 542 354 188 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 843 843 Total $ 11,000 $ 2,506 $ 8,494 In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. which is classified as Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. In connection with the redevelopment project, we recognized an accelerated depreciation charge of approximately $2.6 million, which represents the net book value of the portion of the three-story, low-rise section of the building which is being redeveloped. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $5.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $10.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. During the third quarter of 2004, we placed in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two and ceased capitalizing interest in accordance with our capitalization policy. Net Derivative Losses Net derivative losses for the Total Property Portfolio represent the adjustments to fair value and cash settlements of a derivative contract that was not effective for accounting purposes. The fair value of the derivative contract, which was $1.2 million at December 31, 2004, was included within our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the expiration of this derivative contract in February 2005, we have no further earnings volatility related to this contract. See Part II-Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Losses from early extinguishments of debt For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $6.3 million related to the repayments of our mortgage loans collateralized by One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive buildings. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized approximately $1.5 million related to the early extinguishments of debt related to the repayment of the mortgage loan collateralized by 2300 N Street. Joint Ventures The decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Total Property Portfolio is related to purchasing the remaining interests in 140 Kendrick Street, One and Two Freedom Square and One and Two 58 Table of Contents Discovery Square. 140 Kendrick Street is included in the Total Property Portfolio as of March 24, 2004. One and Two Freedom Square are included in the Total Property Portfolio as of August 5, 2003. One and Two Discovery Square are included in the Total Property Portfolio as of April 1, 2003. The reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from unconsolidated joint ventures to decrease $3.8 million, which was offset by an increase in Same Property joint venture income of approximately $1.2 million. Included in our share of Same Property Portfolio joint venture income is termination income of approximately $1.8 million, of which our share is approximately $1.0 million earned in the second quarter of 2004. Included in Joint Ventures acquired during 2004 is the Value-Added Fund. Approximately $0.2 million of initial organization costs was recognized, resulting in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Property Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during the end of 2004 and 2003 which are no longer included in our operations as of December 31, 2004. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Residence Inn by Marriott Residence Inn by Marriott 40-46 Harvard Street 40-46 Harvard Street Old Federal Reserve Old Federal Reserve Sugarland Business Park-Building One Sugarland Business Park-Building One 204 Second Avenue 204 Second Avenue 560 Forbes Boulevard 560 Forbes Boulevard Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven 38 Cabot Boulevard 38 Cabot Boulevard The Arboretum The Arboretum 430 Rozzi Place 430 Rozzi Place Sugarland Business Park-Building Two Sugarland Business Park-Building Two 875 Third Avenue The Candler Building Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest Gains on the sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Hilltop Office Center and a land parcel in Burlington, MA. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily related to the sale of 2300 N Street. These properties are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee equivalent to market, of these properties after the sales. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Properties included in our gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the Total Portfolio are shown below: Year ended December 31, 2004 Date Disposed Year ended December 31, 2003 Date Disposed 430 Rozzi Place January 2004 The Candler Building January 2003 Sugarland Business Park-Building Two February 2004 875 Third Avenue February 2003 Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven April 2004 The Arboretum April 2004 38 Cabot Boulevard May 2004 Sugarland Business Park-Building One August 2004 204 Second Avenue September 2004 560 Forbes Boulevard December 2004 59 Table of Contents Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased approximately $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. This increase was due to a reduction in the minority interest in our Operating Partnership income allocation related to changes in the partnership ownership interests and an underlying increase in allocable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service requirements including the repayment or refinancing of $217.7 million of indebtedness that matures on or prior to March 1, 2007, $82.3 million of which is due in 2006 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2007, as well as the early repayment of construction financing collateralized by Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million on February 24, 2006; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund current development costs not covered under construction loans; fund new property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that these needs will be satisfied using cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities, as well as cash generated from asset sales. Base rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes. Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, possible property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness; income from operations; income from joint ventures; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in BPLP; and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities. 60 Table of Contents We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by BPLP, our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. Cash and cash equivalents were $261.5 million and $239.3 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively, representing an increase of $22.2 million. The increase was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 472,249 $ 429,506 $ 42,743 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 356,605 $ (171,014 ) $ 527,619 Net cash used in financing activities $ (806,702 ) $ (41,834 ) $ 764,868 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.3 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past year, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and raised proceeds from secured borrowings. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash provided by investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 consisted of the following: (in thousands) Net proceeds from the sales of real estate $ 749,049 Net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 2,313 The cash provided by these investing activities is offset by: Recurring capital expenditures (21,644 ) Planned non-recurring capital expenditures associated with acquisition properties (2,927 ) Hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements (4,097 ) Acquisitions/additions to real estate (366,089 ) Net cash provided by investing activities $ 356,605 Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $806.7 million. This consisted of payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and the unitholders of our Operating Partnership, including the $2.50 per share special distribution, which does not reflect the payment of approximately $12.1 million in February 2006 to holders of our Series Two Preferred Units representing their participation in the special dividend paid to holders of common stock in October 2005. Other factors include 61 Table of Contents changes to our existing debt structure, including the net repayment of certain mortgages as well as proceeds of approximately $45.0 million related to the exercise of options by holders to purchase shares of common stock. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Debt Financing. Capitalization At December 31, 2005, our total consolidated debt was approximately $4.8 billion. The weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 6.39% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.0 years. Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total market capitalization was approximately $15.1 billion at December 31, 2005. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December 30, 2005 closing stock price of $74.13 per common share and the following: (1) 112,542,262 shares of our common stock, (2) 21,377,724 outstanding common units of limited partnership of BPLP (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 4,857,395 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding preferred units of partnership interest in BPLP, (4) an aggregate of 380,821 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $4.8 billion. Our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2005 represented approximately 31.87% of our total market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness. Debt Financing As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $4.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness, representing 31.87% of our total market capitalization as calculated above under the heading Capitalization, consisting of approximately $1.5 billion in publicly traded unsecured debt at an average interest rate of 5.95% with maturities ranging from 2013 to 2015, $3.3 billion of property-specific debt, including $225.0 million of indebtedness under our unsecured line of credit, and approximately $58.0 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit. The table below summarizes our outstanding debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,952,151 $ 4,588,024 Variable rate 874,103 423,790 Total $ 4,826,254 $ 5,011,814 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 81.89 % 91.54 % Variable rate 18.11 % 8.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.70 % 6.66 % Variable rate 4.96 % 3.36 % Total 6.39 % 6.38 % 62 Table of Contents The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2005, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 0.59% per annum. Unsecured Line of Credit On May 19, 2005, we modified our $605.0 million unsecured line of credit by extending the maturity date from January 17, 2006 to October 30, 2007, with a provision for a one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.70% to Eurodollar plus 0.65%. In addition a facility fee equal to 15 basis point per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in BPLP senior unsecured debt ratings. The unsecured line of credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to us at a reduced Eurodollar rate. We utilize the unsecured line of credit principally to fund development of properties, land and property acquisitions, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and for working capital purposes. Our unsecured line of credit is a recourse obligation of BPLP. Our ability to borrow under our unsecured line of credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however for a single period of not more than five consecutive quarters the leverage ratio can exceed 60% (but may not exceed 65%); a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%; a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40; an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%; a minimum net worth requirement; an unsecured interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and restrictions on permitted investments, development, partially owned entities, business outside of commercial real estate and commercial non-office properties We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above. At December 31, 2005, we had letters of credit totaling $8.5 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit. On July 19, 2005, we refinanced $225 million of mortgage indebtedness at 599 Lexington Avenue through a secured draw on our unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had the ability to borrow an additional $313.5 million under our unsecured line of credit. As of March 8, 2006 we have borrowings of $300 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit with the ability to borrow an additional $296.5 million under our unsecured line of credit. Unsecured Senior Notes The following summarizes the unsecured senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Coupon/ Stated Rate Effective Rate (1) Principal Amount Maturity Date (2) 10 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 6.250 % 6.296 % $ 750,000 January 15, 2013 10 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 6.250 % 6.280 % 175,000 January 15, 2013 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 5.625 % 5.636 % 300,000 April 15, 2015 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 5.000 % 5.075 % 250,000 June 1, 2015 Total principal 1,475,000 Net discount (3,938 ) Total $ 1,471,062 (1) Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes. (2) No principal amounts are due prior to maturity. 63 Table of Contents Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of their principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis point in the case of the $250 million 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes that mature on June 1, 2015), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our senior unsecured notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2005 we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. BPLP investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured notes are as follows: Rating Organization Rating Moody Baa2 (stable) Standard & Poor BBB (stable) FitchRatings BBB (stable) The security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, as it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Unsecured Bridge Loan On September 25, 2002, we obtained unsecured bridge financing totaling $1.0 billion in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue. During January 2003, we repaid the remaining $105.7 million under our unsecured bridge loan with proceeds from the January 2003 offering of senior unsecured notes. Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2005, our total consolidated debt was approximately $4.8 billion. The weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 6.39% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.0 years. At December 31, 2005, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans on Times Square Tower, our Seven Cambridge Center project and our Capital Gallery Redevelopment project and mortgage indebtedness at 599 Lexington Avenue through a secured draw on our unsecured line of credit. Variable rate debt constituted 18.11% of our total debt as of December 31, 2005. We plan on financing our larger development properties with property-specific construction debt because of the time associated with the development of those properties and we plan on utilizing our unsecured line of credit for other transactions as they occur. 64 Table of Contents The following table sets forth certain information regarding our mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2005: Properties Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date (in thousands) Citigroup Center 7.19 % $ 498,073 May 11, 2011 Times Square Tower 4.87 % 475,000 (1) July 9, 2008 Embarcadero Center One and Two 6.70 % 290,285 December 10, 2008 Prudential Center 6.72 % 270,581 July 1, 2008 280 Park Avenue 7.64 % 256,111 February 1, 2011 599 Lexington Avenue 4.75 % 225,000 (2) October 30, 2007 Embarcadero Center Four 6.79 % 138,119 February 1, 2008 Embarcadero Center Three 6.40 % 135,397 January 1, 2007 Seven Cambridge Center 5.63 % 98,859 (3) April 14, 2007 Democracy Center 7.05 % 98,407 April 1, 2009 One Freedom Square 5.33 % 80,013 (4) June 30, 2012 New Dominion Tech Park, Bldg.

We intend to repay this financing upon the maturity date of the existing financing of $50.7 million at Capital Gallery upon its maturity in August 2006. (12) On January 31, 2006, we repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by this property. Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands): Year Principal Payments 2006 $ 147,730 2007 505,236 2008 1,276,323 2009 188,278 2010 134,778 Thereafter 1,044,847 $ 3,297,192 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term fixed rate non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 81.89% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates. During 2005 we entered into twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the 10-year treasury rate for a financing in February 2007 at a weighted average rate of 4.34% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $500.0 million. The swaps go into effect in February 2007 and expire in February 2017. We obtained the swaps to lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spread in contemplation of obtaining long-term fixed-rate financing to refinance existing debt that is expiring or freely prepayable prior to February 2007. We expect to settle the interest rate swaps in cash at the time we close on the long-term fixed-rate financing. Each swap contract provides for a fixed 10-year LIBOR swap rate (the fixed strike rate) ranging from 66 Table of Contents 4.562% per annum to 5.016% per annum. If the 10-year LIBOR swap rate is below the fixed strike rate at the time we settle each swap, we would be required to make a payment to the swap counter-parties; if the 10-year LIBOR swap rate is above the fixed strike rate at the time we cash settle each swap, we would receive a payment from the swap counter-parties. The amount that we either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year swap rate at the time we settle each swap. We believe that these swaps qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. We intend to consider entering into additional hedging arrangements to minimize our interest rate risk. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we had a derivative contract in a notional amount of $150 million. Prior to the modification described below, the derivative contract provided for a fixed interest rate of 6.35% when LIBOR is less than 5.80%, 6.70% when LIBOR is between 6.70% and 7.45%, and 7.50% when LIBOR is between 7.51% and 9.00% through February 2005. In August 2003, we modified the contract to provide for the counter party to pay us LIBOR and we were required to pay the counter party LIBOR in arrears plus 4.55% per annum on the notional amount of $150 million. The derivative contract expired in February 2005. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the derivative agreement is reflected at its fair market value, which was a liability of $1.2 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $874.1 million. At December 31, 2005, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 4.96%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2004, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $424 million. At December 31, 2004, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 3.36%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amounts represent of our share, which was 83.74%, 82.97%, 82.06%, 81.98% and 81.23% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 67 Table of Contents In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments. The adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions. The adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments from the first quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment. The adjustments for early lease surrender for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 resulted from a unique lease transaction related to the surrender of space by a tenant that was accounted for as a termination for GAAP purposes and recorded in income at the time the space was surrendered. However, we continued to collect payments monthly after the surrender of space through the month of July 2002, the date on which the terminated lease would otherwise have expired under its original terms. Management presents FFO after the early surrender lease adjustment because economically this transaction impacted periods subsequent to the time the space was surrendered by the tenant and, therefore, recording the entire amount of the lease termination payment in a single period made FFO less useful as an indicator of operating performance. Although these adjustments are attributable to a single lease, the transaction impacted multiple reporting periods and resulted in adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted, should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 68 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001: Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Net income available to common shareholders $ 438,292 $ 284,017 $ 365,322 $ 440,971 $ 201,440 Add: Preferred dividend 3,412 6,592 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest 4,223 6,767 Minority interest in Operating Partnership 74,103 67,743 72,729 71,587 67,049 Less: Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 47,656 27,338 73,234 25,345 Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 1,908 3,344 10,925 26,195 36,108 Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest 151,884 8,149 57,574 190,443 9,089 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 4,829 3,380 6,016 7,954 4,186 Minority interests in property partnerships 6,017 4,685 1,827 2,408 1,409 Income before minority interests in property partnerships, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership, gains on sales of real estate and other assets, discontinued operations, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and preferred dividend 304,324 304,864 288,475 263,625 231,056 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization (1) 274,476 257,319 216,235 192,574 153,550 Income from discontinued operations 2,279 4,238 13,644 32,294 44,776 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 4,829 3,380 6,016 7,954 4,186 Less: Minority interests in property partnerships share of funds from operations 113 922 3,458 3,223 2,322 Preferred dividends and distributions 12,918 (2) 15,050 21,249 28,711 33,312 Funds from operations 572,877 553,829 499,663 464,513 397,934 Add(subtract): Losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 11,041 1,474 2,386 Net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) 1,038 11,874 26,488 Early surrender lease adjustment 8,520 (8,520 ) Funds from operations after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and early surrender lease adjustment $ 583,918 $ 553,829 $ 502,175 $ 487,293 $ 415,902 Less: Minority interest in Operating Partnership share of funds from operations after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and early surrender lease adjustment 94,946 94,332 90,102 87,804 78,079 Funds from operations available to common shareholders after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and early surrender lease adjustment $ 488,972 $ 459,497 $ 412,073 $ 399,489 $ 337,823 Our percentage share of funds from operations basic 83.74 % 82.97 % 82.06 % 81.98 % 81.23 % Weighted average shares outstanding basic 111,274 106,458 96,900 93,145 90,002 (1) Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $266,829, $249,649, $206,686, $176,412 and $140,197, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $8,554, $6,814, $8,475, $8,955 and $5,410, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $812, $3,292, $3,791, $10,016 and $9,966, less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,719, $2,436, $2,717, $2,809 and $2,023 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(2) Excludes approximately $12.1 million of income allocated to the holders of Series Two Preferred Units to account for their right to participate on an as-converted basis in the special dividend that followed previously completed sales of real estate. 70 Table of Contents Net Operating Income Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses on investments in securities, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), preferred dividends, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2001 through 2005.

We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Ventures We have investments in seven unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 51%, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2005, our share of the debt related to these investments was equal to approximately $212.2 million. The table below summarizes our share of the outstanding debt (based on our respective ownership interests) of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2005: Properties Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date (in thousands) Metropolitan Square (51%) 8.23 % $ 67,529 May 1, 2010 Market Square North (50%) 7.70 % 46,057 December 19, 2010 901 New York Avenue (25%) 5.19 % 42,500 January 1,2015 265 Franklin Street (35%) 5.41 %(1) 20,850 September 30, 2007 Worldgate Plaza (25%) 5.21 %(2) 14,250 December 1, 2007 Wisconsin Place (23.89%) (3) 5.58 %(3) 8,743 March 11, 2009 Wisconsin Place (23.89%) (4) 4.38 %(4) 5,362 January 1, 2008 505 9 th Avenue (5) 5.69 %(5) 5,044 See note 5 300 Billerica Road (6) 5.69 % 1,875 January 1, 2016 Total 6.80 % $ 212,210 (1) The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.10% per annum and requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. 72 Table of Contents (2) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.89% per annum and requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. This mortgage matures in December 2007, with two one-year extension options. In addition, the Value-Added Fund entered into an agreement to cap the interest rate at 9.5% for a nominal fee. (3) Amount represents construction financing of up to $96.5 million, of which our maximum share is $23.1 million, at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum with a maturity in March 2009. The mortgage debt requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. We have guaranteed approximately $4.6 million of the total construction loan amount on behalf of the land and infrastructure entity. (4) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted to reflect the fair value of the note using an effective interest rate of 4.38% per annum. This note is non-interest bearing and matures in January 2008. The weighted average rates exclude the impact of this loan. We have agreed, together with our third-party joint venture partners to guarantee this seller financing on behalf of the land and infrastructure entity. (5) Amount represents construction financing comprised of a $60.0 million loan commitment (of which our share is $30.0 million) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.73% per annum and a $35.0 million loan commitment (of which our share is $17.5 million) which bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. The financing converts to a ten-year fixed rate loan in October 2007 at an interest rate of 5.73% per annum with a provision for an increase in the borrowing capacity by $35.0 million (of which our share would be $17.5 million). The conversion is subject to conditions which we expect to satisfy. As of December 31, 2005 the interest rate on the variable rate portion of the debt was 5.62% per annum. The weighted average rate as of December 31, 2005 is reflected in the table. (6) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. The mortgage financing bears interest at a fixed rate and requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at two of our properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In both cases we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property Status Opinions. The environmental consultant 73 Table of Contents concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. We own a property in Massachusetts where historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The environmental consultant has concluded that (1) certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off-site source property and (2) certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic release on the subject property. We have filed a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to contamination migrating from off-site and a Response Action Outcome ( RAO ) with respect to the identified historic release. The RAO indicates that regulatory closure has been achieved and that no further action is required at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. We own a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. We anticipate that additional response actions necessary to achieve regulatory closure (if any) will be performed prior to or in connection with future development activities. When appropriate, closure documentation will be submitted for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory authority public information process. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. Newly Issued Accounting Standards- In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS Statement No. 3 ( SFAS No. 154 ). SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of the change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. 74 Table of Contents In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) regarding EITF 04-5, Investor Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights ( EITF 04-5 ). The conclusion provides a framework for addressing the question of when a sole general partner, as defined in EITF 04-5, should consolidate a limited partnership. Pursuant to EITF 04-5, the general partner of a limited partnership should consolidate a limited partnership unless the limited partners have either (a) the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause, or (b) substantive participating rights. In addition, EITF 04-5 concluded that the guidance should be expanded to include all limited partnerships, including those with multiple general partners. EITF 04-5 became effective on June 29, 2005 for all agreements entered into or modified after June 29, 2005. For pre-existing agreements that have not been modified, EITF 04-05 is effective for reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 04-5 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon the acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of an asset. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 became effective and we adopted it on December 31, 2005. Certain of our real estate assets contain asbestos. Although the asbestos is appropriately contained, in accordance with current environmental regulations, our practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties. At December 31, 2005, we have recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations. 75 Table of Contents
