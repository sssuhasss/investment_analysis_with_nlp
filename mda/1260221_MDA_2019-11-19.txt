ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Selected Financial Data and TD Group consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below. Overview For fiscal year 2019 , we generated net sales of $5,223.2 million , gross profit of $2,809.3 million or 53.8% of sales, and net income of $889.8 million . We believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term. Our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business. The integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business. We believe our key competitive strengths include: Large and Growing Installed Product Base with Aftermarket Revenue Stream. We provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. We estimate that our products are installed on over 100,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft. Diversified Revenue Base. We believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. Our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. We expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications. Barriers to Entry . We believe that the niche nature of our markets, the industry stringent regulatory and certification requirements, the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products. Our business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy. Value-Driven Operating Strategy. Our three core value drivers are: Obtaining Profitable New Business. We attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. We have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and OEM products to drive our growth. Improving Our Cost Structure. We are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each. Providing Highly Engineered Value-Added Products to Customers. We focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. We believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. This has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so. Selective Acquisition Strategy. We selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. The aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. We have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. As of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired approximately 85 businesses and/or product lines since our formation in 1993. Many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing TransDigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume. In fiscal 2019, we completed our largest acquisition to date when we acquired Esterline. Esterline, through its subsidiaries, is an industry 27 Table of Contents leader in specialized manufacturing for the aerospace and defense industry, including significant aftermarket exposure, primarily within three core disciplines: advanced materials, avionics and controls and sensors and systems. Acquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years are more fully described in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenue Recognition : In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, which created a new topic in the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, ASC 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The results for periods before fiscal 2019 were not restated for the new standard and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting was recognized through retained earnings at the date of adoption. Refer to Note 5, "Revenue Recognition," for additional disclosures relating to ASC 606. Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer, which is demonstrated by our right to payment, a transfer of title, a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership, or the customer acceptance, but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods. The majority of the Company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. Inventories : Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. Because the Company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 25 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. Where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. Although management believes that the Company estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. In addition, in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year. Historically, changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets : In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. We determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Fair value adjustments to the Company assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition . 28 Table of Contents Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Company intent to do so. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates. GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. The reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit. At the time of goodwill impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit. For the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital ( WACC ) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. As an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting unit estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the Company. The Company had 54 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the date of the last annual impairment test. The estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values, and therefore, no goodwill impairment was recorded. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values. With a one percentage point increase in the discount rate, all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values. Management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. Management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the WACC methodology considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. Management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. The discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions. Stock-Based Compensation : The cost of the Company stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. The Company uses a Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the Company common shares, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the stock options award and the Company dividend yield. The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management control could have an impact on the Black-Scholes pricing model. 29 Table of Contents Income Taxes : The Company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. Historically, such adjustments have not been significant. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data of the Company, including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales (amounts in thousands): Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2019 2019 % of Sales 2018 2018 % of Sales 2017 2017 % of Sales Net sales $ 5,223,203 100.0 % $ 3,811,126 100.0 % $ 3,504,286 100.0 % Cost of sales 2,413,932 46.2 % 1,633,616 42.9 % 1,519,659 43.4 % Selling and administrative expenses 747,773 14.3 % 449,676 11.8 % 412,555 11.8 % Amortization of intangible assets 134,952 2.6 % 72,454 1.9 % 89,226 2.5 % Income from operations 1,926,546 36.9 % 1,655,380 43.4 % 1,482,846 42.3 % Interest expense net 859,753 16.5 % 663,008 17.4 % 602,589 17.2 % Refinancing costs 3,013 0.1 % 6,396 0.2 % 39,807 1.1 % Other expense 915 % 419 % 3,020 0.1 % Income tax provision 221,986 4.2 % 24,021 0.6 % 208,889 6.0 % Income from continuing operations including noncontrolling interests 840,879 16.1 % 961,536 25.2 % 628,541 17.9 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 50,432 1.0 % (4,474 ) (0.1 )% (31,654 ) (0.9 )% Net income including noncontrolling interests 891,311 17.1 % 957,062 25.1 % 596,887 17.0 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,541 ) % % % Net income attributable to TD Group $ 889,770 17.0 % $ 957,062 25.1 % $ 596,887 17.0 % Fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 Total Company Net Sales . Net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (amounts in millions): Fiscal Years Ended Change % Change Total Sales September 30, 2019 September 30, 2018 Organic sales $ 4,212.7 $ 3,811.1 $ 401.6 10.5 % Acquisition sales 1,010.5 1,010.5 26.5 % $ 5,223.2 $ 3,811.1 $ 1,412.1 37.0 % The increase in organic sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 , is primarily related to an increase in defense sales ( $180.8 million , an increase of 13.6% ), commercial OEM sales ( $115.1 million , an increase of 11.9% ) and commercial aftermarket sales ( $105.5 million , an increase of 7.9% ). Acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. The amount of acquisition sales displayed in the table above for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 are attributable to the acquisitions of Esterline (March 2019), Skandia (July 2018), Extant (April 2018) and Kirkhill (March 2018). 30 Table of Contents Cost of Sales and Gross Profit . Cost of sales increased by $780.3 million , or 47.8% , to $2,413.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared to $1,633.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 . Cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (amounts in millions): Fiscal Years Ended Change % Change September 30, 2019 September 30, 2018 Cost of sales excluding costs below $ 2,319.4 $ 1,607.2 $ 712.2 44.3 % % of total sales 44.4 % 42.2 % Inventory acquisition accounting adjustments 76.9 7.1 69.8 983.1 % % of total sales 1.5 % 0.2 % Stock compensation expense 9.3 5.9 3.4 57.6 % % of total sales 0.2 % 0.2 % Acquisition integration costs 13.1 13.8 (0.7 ) (5.1 )% % of total sales 0.3 % 0.4 % Foreign currency gain (4.8 ) (0.4 ) (4.4 ) (1,100.0 )% % of total sales (0.1 )% % Total cost of sales $ 2,413.9 $ 1,633.6 $ 780.3 47.8 % % of total sales 46.2 % 42.9 % Gross profit $ 2,809.3 $ 2,177.5 $ 631.8 29.0 % Gross profit percentage 53.8 % 57.1 % (3.3 )% The net increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to increased sales volume, both organic and from recent acquisitions, an increase in inventory acquisition accounting adjustments resulting from the Esterline acquisition, and an increase in stock compensation expense. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition integration costs and higher foreign currency gains as presented in the table above. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 3.3 percentage points to 53.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 from 57.1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 . The dollar amount of gross profit increased by $631.8 million , or 29.0% , for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 due to the following items: Gross profit on the sales from the acquisitions (excluding acquisition-related costs) was approximately $416.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 , which represented gross profit of approximately 41% of the acquisition sales. Organic sales growth described above, application of our three core value-driven operating strategies and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume resulted in an increase in gross profit of approximately $283.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 . Offsetting increases in gross profit by $68.1 million compared to the prior fiscal year was attributable to increased inventory acquisition accounting adjustments, increased stock compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition integration costs and higher foreign currency gains. Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased by $298.6 million to $748.7 million , or 14.3% of sales, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 from $450.1 million , or 11.8% of sales, for the comparable period last year. Selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (amounts in millions): Fiscal Years Ended Change % Change September 30, 2019 September 30, 2018 Selling and administrative expenses excluding costs below $ 585.9 $ 389.9 $ 196.0 50.3 % % of total sales 11.2 % 10.2 % Acquisition-related expenses 78.8 7.6 71.2 936.8 % % of total sales 1.5 % 0.2 % Stock compensation expense 84.0 52.6 31.4 59.7 % % of total sales 1.6 % 1.4 % Total selling and administrative expenses $ 748.7 $ 450.1 $ 298.6 66.3 % % of total sales 14.3 % 11.8 % 31 Table of Contents The increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 is primarily due to higher acquisition-related expenses of $71.2 million , higher stock compensation expense of $31.4 million and higher selling and administrative expenses resulting from primarily the acquisition of Esterline in March 2019. Also contributing to the increase in selling and administrative expenses was a $16.1 million payment of a voluntary refund to several U.S. Department of Defense agencies that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $135.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared to $72.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 . The increase in amortization expense of $62.5 million was primarily due to the amortization expense on the definite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Esterline. Refinancing Costs. Refinancing costs of $3.0 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and primarily related to the debt financing activities that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Refinancing costs of $6.4 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the fiscal 2018 debt financing activity. Interest Expense-net. Interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium and revolving credit facility fees slightly offset by interest income. Interest expense-net increased $196.8 million , or 29.7% , to $859.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 from $663.0 million for the comparable period last year. The net increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings, which was approximately $15.5 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared to approximately $12.6 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 . The increase in weighted average level of borrowings was primarily due to the activity in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 consisting of the issuance of $4.0 billion in 2026 Secured Notes and $550 million in 2027 Notes and the activity in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 consisting of issuing additional term loans of $700 million (gross) and issuing $500 million in 6.875% 2026 Notes. The increases in new debt described above were partially offset by principal payments on the term loans over the comparable period and redemption of the 2020 Notes. The weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2019 was 5.6%. Income Taxes. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 20.9% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 . The Company higher effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due benefits recognized in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act along with additional taxes recognized in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 as described in Note 14, Income Taxes. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations . On July 21, 2019, the Company entered into a binding offer for the acquisition by Eaton Corporation plc of the shares of Souriau-Sunbank for approximately $920 million. The parties are expected to complete the transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Therefore, Souriau-Sunbank is classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2019 . The results of operations of Souriau-Sunbank are presented in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented since the date acquired. On September 20, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its EIT group of businesses to an affiliate of KPS Capital Partners, LP for approximately $190 million. The income from discontinued operations was $50.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 , which includes the operating results for Souriau-Sunbank and EIT. On January 26, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Schroth in a management buy out to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately $61.4 million which included a working capital adjustment of $0.3 million paid in July 2018. The loss from discontinued operations was $(4.5) million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 . Net Income Attributable to TD Group . Net income attributable to TD Group decreased $67.3 million , or 7.0% , to $889.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 compared to net income attributable to TD Group of $957.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 , primarily as a result of the factors referred to above. Earnings per Share . Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and discontinued operations were $12.94 and $0.90 , respectively for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 . For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 , basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations and discontinued operations were $16.28 and $(0.08) , respectively. Net income attributable to TD Group for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 of $889.8 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $111.0 million , or $1.97 per share, resulting in net income available to common shareholders of $778.7 million , or $13.84 per share. Net income attributable to TD Group for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 of $957.1 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $56.1 million , or $1.01 per share, resulting in net income available to common shareholders of $900.9 million , or $16.20 per share. The decrease of $2.36 per share is a result of the factors referred to above. 32 Table of Contents Business Segments Segment Net Sales . Net sales by segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (amounts in millions): Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Change % Change 2019 % of Sales 2018 % of Sales Power & Control $ 2,735.6 52.4 % $ 2,139.1 56.1 % $ 596.5 27.9 % Airframe 2,329.4 44.6 % 1,530.9 40.2 % 798.5 52.2 % Non-aviation 158.2 3.0 % 141.0 3.7 % 17.2 12.2 % $ 5,223.2 100.0 % $ 3,811.0 100.0 % $ 1,412.2 37.1 % Acquisition sales for the Power & Control segment totaled $359.3 million , or an increase of 16.8% , resulting from the acquisitions of Esterline and Extant.

EBITDA As Defined by segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (amounts in millions): Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Change % Change 2019 % of Segment Sales 2018 % of Segment Sales Power & Control $ 1,395.1 51.0 % $ 1,114.4 52.1 % $ 280.7 25.2 % Airframe 1,062.7 45.6 % 759.3 49.6 % 303.4 40.0 % Non-aviation 50.6 32.0 % 44.3 31.4 % 6.3 14.2 % $ 2,508.4 48.0 % $ 1,918.0 50.3 % $ 590.4 30.8 % EBITDA As Defined for the Power & Control segment from the acquisitions of Esterline and Extant was approximately $107.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 . Organic EBITDA As Defined for the Power & Control segment increased approximately $173.2 million, an increase of 15.5%, resulting from organic sales growth in defense, commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM, along with the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume. EBITDA As Defined for the Airframe segment from the acquisitions of Esterline, Kirkhill and Skandia was approximately $191.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 . Organic EBITDA As Defined for the Airframe segment increased approximately $111.9 million, an increase of 14.7%, resulting from organic sales growth in commercial OEM, defense and commercial aftermarket, along with the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume.

Organic EBITDA As Defined for the Non-aviation segment increased approximately $5.1 million, an increase of 11.5%. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 For our results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, refer to the discussion in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 9, 2018. 33 Table of Contents Backlog For information about our backlog, see Item 1. Business. Foreign Operations Our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $1,778.4 million , $1,355.1 million , and $1,318.9 million for the fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the Company within such governments countries. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the United States will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy. Inflation Many of the Company raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation, which could result in changing operating costs. Furthermore, recently implemented changes to U.S. and other countries tariff and import/export regulations may have an unfavorable impact on raw materials pricing. The effects of inflation on the Company businesses during the fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were immaterial. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. We expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and/or through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt. We continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business. The Company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage, taking into consideration the Company debt holders, equity holders, credit ratings, acquisition opportunities and other factors. The Company debt leverage ratio, which is computed as total debt divided by EBITDA As Defined for the applicable twelve-month period, has varied widely during the Company history, ranging from approximately 3.5 to 7.2. Our debt leverage ratio at September 30, 2019 was approximately 7.0 . If the Company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt. Whether the Company undertakes common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, the Company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so. The Company ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the Company indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the Company ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control. As a result of the debt financing transactions completed during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 as described in Note 12, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements, and completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as described in the paragraphs below and in Note 26, "Subsequent Events," to the consolidated financial statements, interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements. However, in connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide more than sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs. We believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business combinations, pay dividends to our shareholders and/or make opportunistic investments in our own stock. On October 29, 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of $2.65 billion aggregate principal amount in 5.50% senior subordinated notes due November 15, 2027. The settlement of the debt financing transaction occurred on November 13, 2019. The notes were issued at a price of 100% of their principal amount. The Company will use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to redeem all of its outstanding (aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion) 6.000% senior subordinated notes due 2022. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include potential future acquisitions, dividends or repurchases under its stock repurchase program. Two recent divestitures of businesses within the Non-aviation segment are expected to provide approximately $1.1 billion in gross cash proceeds to TransDigm. On September 20, 2019, TransDigm completed the divestiture of its Esterline Interface Technology ( EIT ) group of businesses to an affiliate of KPS Capital Partners, LP for approximately $190 million. EIT was acquired by TransDigm as part of its approximately $4.0 billion acquisition of Esterline in March 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, TransDigm is expected to complete the sale of the shares of the Souriau-Sunbank Companies ( Souriau-Sunbank ) to Eaton Corporation plc for approximately $920 million. Souriau-Sunbank was also acquired by TransDigm as part of its acquisition of Esterline. On August 23, 2019, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $30.00 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on options granted under its stock incentive plans. The total cash payments related to the special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in fiscal 2019 were approximately $1.7 billion. We do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Any declaration of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions under the senior secured credit facility and Indentures, the availability of surplus under Delaware law and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. TD Group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries. Unless TD Group receives dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries, TD Group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future. The ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the 35 Table of Contents foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our senior secured credit facility and Indentures and may be limited by future debt or other agreements that we may enter into. In the future, the Company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends. Our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets. Operating Activities . The Company generated $1,015.5 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2019 compared to $1,022.2 million during fiscal 2018 . The change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2019 was a use of $82.3 million in cash compared to a use of cash of $43.8 million in fiscal 2018 . The increase in the use of cash of $38.5 million is primarily attributable to an increase in sales and related timing of receipt of payment from customers. The change in inventories during fiscal 2019 was a use of cash of $35.7 million compared to a use of cash of $17.9 million in fiscal 2018 . The increase in the use of cash of $17.8 million compared to prior year relates to the building up of inventories at certain reporting units during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 based on existing backlog for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The change in accounts payable during fiscal 2019 was a use of cash of $1.6 million compared to a source of cash of $18.1 million in fiscal 2018 with the increase in the use of cash due to the timing of payments made to certain suppliers. The Company generated $1,022.2 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2018 compared to $788.7 million during fiscal 2017. The net increase of $233.5 million is primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations of $156.6 million (excludes the non-cash effects of the adjustments resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $176.4 million). Changes in inventories, accounts payable and trade accounts receivable improved by approximately $23.4 million compared to the prior year. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $3,889.0 million during fiscal 2019 , primarily consisting of capital expenditures of $101.6 million and payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $3,976.2 million which is primarily comprised of the acquisitions of Esterline for $3,923.9 million and NavCom for $27.0 million partially offset by the net cash proceeds received from the sale of EIT of $188.8 million. The Company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2020 to be between $160 million and $190 million with the increase from previous years attributable to the Esterline businesses being under TransDigm ownership for the entire fiscal year period. The Company capital expenditures incurred from year to year are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improve our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers). In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to complete the sale of Souriau-Sunbank and receive approximately $920 million in gross cash proceeds from the sale. Net cash used in investing activities was $683.6 million during fiscal 2018 , primarily consisting of cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of Kirkhill, Extant, and Skandia of $667.6 million and capital expenditures of $73.3 million slightly offset by the net cash proceeds received from the sale of Schroth of $57.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $287.0 million during fiscal 2017 , primarily consisting of cash paid for the Third Quarter 2017 Acquisitions of $106.3 million, the cash settlement of the Breeze-Eastern dissenting shares litigation of $28.7 million, the acquisition of Schroth of $79.7 million and capital expenditures of $71.0 million . Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was $2,271.4 million . The source of cash was primarily attributable to $4,479.8 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 2026 Secured Notes and 2027 Notes offerings in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and $81.9 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. Sources were partially offset by the cash tender and redemption of the 2020 Notes for $550.0 million , repayment on term loans of $76.4 million , and the payment of $1,712.2 million in special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in fiscal 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company received gross cash proceeds of approximately $2.65 billion from the completion of the 5.50% senior subordinated Notes offering. The Company will use a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the notes to redeem all of its outstanding (aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion) 6.000% senior subordinated notes due 2022. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include potential future acquisitions, dividends or repurchases under its stock repurchase program. Net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 was $1,085.6 million. The source of cash was primarily due to the net proceeds of $678.6 million from the fiscal 2018 term loans activity and net proceeds of $489.6 million from the issuance of the 6.875% 2026 Notes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, along with $57.8 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. Partially offsetting these sources of cash were $56.1 million in dividend equivalent payments made in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was $1,443.7 million. The use of cash was primarily related to the aggregate payment of $2,581.6 million for a $24.00 per share special dividend declared and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a $22.00 per share special dividend declared and paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and 36 Table of Contents dividend equivalent payments. Also contributing to the use of cash was $1,284.7 million in debt service payments on the existing term loans and the remaining principal on the tranche C term loans, redemption and related premium paid on the 2021 Notes aggregating to $528.8 million and $389.8 million related to treasury stock purchases under the Company's share repurchase program. Slightly offsetting the uses of cash were net proceeds from the 2017 term loans (tranche F and tranche G term loans) of $2,937.7 million and the additional 2025 Notes offering of $300.4 million, $99.5 million in net proceeds from an additional A/R Securitization draw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and $21.2 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. Description of Senior Secured Term Loans and Indentures Senior Secured Credit Facilities TransDigm has $7,523.5 million in fully drawn term loans (the Term Loans Facility ) and a $760.0 million revolving credit facility. The Term Loans Facility consists of three tranches of term loans as follows (aggregate principal amount disclosed is as of September 30, 2019 ): Term Loans Facility Aggregate Principal Maturity Date Interest Rate Tranche E $2,221.2 million May 30, 2025 LIBO rate + 2.5% Tranche F $3,524.1 million June 9, 2023 LIBO rate + 2.5% Tranche G $1,778.2 million August 22, 2024 LIBO rate + 2.5% The Term Loans Facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of $19.1 million. The revolving commitments consist of two tranches which include up to $151.5 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. At September 30, 2019 , the Company had $41.5 million in letters of credit outstanding and $718.5 million in borrowings available under the revolving commitments. The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Credit Agreement are, at TransDigm option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent agreed to by each relevant lender, nine or twelve-month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The adjusted LIBO rate related to tranche E, tranche F and tranche G term loans are not subject to a floor. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 , the applicable interest rates ranged from approximately 4.7% to 5.0% on the existing term loans. Interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Amendments to the Credit Agreement On March 14, 2019, the Company entered into Amendment No. 6 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 6"). Under the terms of Amendment No. 6, the capacity of the revolving credit facility increased from $600.0 million to $760.0 million. The revolving commitments consist of two tranches which include up to $151.5 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. The terms and conditions that apply to the revolving credit facility, other than the additional revolving credit commitments, are substantially the same as the terms and conditions that applied to the revolving credit facility immediately prior to Amendment No. 6.

Interest under the Notes is payable semi-annually. The Notes represent our unsecured obligations ranking subordinate to our senior debt, as defined in the applicable indentures. The Notes are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior debt, rank equally with all of our existing and future senior subordinated debt and rank senior to all of our future debt that is expressly subordinated to the Notes. The TransDigm Inc. Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated unsecured basis by TD Group and TransDigm Inc.'s domestic restricted subsidiaries. The TransDigm UK Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by TransDigm Inc., TD Group and TransDigm Inc.'s domestic restricted subsidiaries. The guarantees of the Notes are subordinated to all of the guarantors existing and future senior debt, rank equally with all of their existing and future senior subordinated debt and rank senior to all of their future debt that is expressly subordinated to the guarantees of the Notes. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of TD Group non-guarantor subsidiaries. The Notes contain many of the restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement. TransDigm is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Notes. On January 30, 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount in 6.25% senior secured notes due 2026. In addition, on February 1, 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of $200 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior secured notes due 2026. All $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the secured notes constituted a single class and were issued under a single indenture (herein the "2026 Secured Notes"). The notes in the first secured notes offering were issued at a price of 100% of their principal amount and the notes in the second secured notes offering were issued at a price of 101% of their principal amount. The Notes are guaranteed, with certain exceptions, by TransDigm Group, TransDigm UK and all of TransDigm Inc. existing U.S. subsidiaries on a senior secured basis. The 2026 Secured Notes offerings closed on February 13, 2019 and mature on March 15, 2026. On February 13, 2019, the Company announced a cash tender offer for any and all of Esterline outstanding 2020 Notes.

On October 29, 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of $2.65 billion aggregate principal amount in 5.50% senior subordinated notes due November 15, 2027. The settlement of the debt financing transaction occurred on November 13, 2019. The notes were issued at a price of 100% of their principal amount. The Company will use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to redeem all of its outstanding 2022 Notes. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include potential future acquisitions, dividends or repurchases under its stock repurchase program. Certain Restrictive Covenants in Our Debt Documents The Credit Agreement and the Indentures governing the Notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of special dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of certain other indebtedness. The restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement are subject to amendments executed periodically. The most recent amendment that impacted the restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Agreement is Amendment No. 6 which is described above in the Recent Amendments to the Credit Agreement section. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, TransDigm is entitled, on one or more occasions, to request additional term loans or additional revolving commitments to the extent that the existing or new lenders agree to provide such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments provided that, among other conditions, our consolidated net leverage ratio would be no greater than 7.25 to 1.00 and the consolidated secured net debt ratio would be no greater than 5.00 to 1.00, in each case, after giving effect to such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments. The Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments of principal based on certain percentages of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement), commencing 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, subject to certain exceptions (including, with respect to asset sales, the reinvestment in productive assets), TransDigm will be required to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and issuance or incurrence of certain indebtedness. No matters mandating prepayments occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 . In addition, under the Credit Agreement, if the usage of the revolving credit facility exceeds 35% of the total revolving commitments, the Company will be required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt, as defined, to trailing four- 38 Table of Contents quarter EBITDA As Defined. A breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the Credit Agreement or the Indentures. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the holders of the Notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Credit Agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes. As of September 30, 2019 , the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. Trade Receivables Securitization During fiscal 2014, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility ). The Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations trade accounts receivable. The Securitization Facility includes the right for the Company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. The Company uses the proceeds from the Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs. On July 30, 2019, the Company amended the Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to July 31, 2020. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has borrowed $350 million under the Securitization Facility, which bears interest at a rate of 0.9% plus LIBOR. At September 30, 2019, the applicable interest rate was 2.94%. The Securitization Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company domestic operations trade accounts receivable. Stock Repurchase Program On November 8, 2017, our Board of Directors, authorized a stock repurchase program permitting repurchases of our outstanding shares not to exceed $650 million in the aggregate, subject to any restrictions specified in the Credit Agreement and/or Indentures governing the existing Notes. No repurchases were made under the program during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. As of September 30, 2019, $650 million in repurchases are allowable under the program subject to any restrictions specified in the Credit Agreement and/or Indentures governing the existing Notes. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2019 (in millions): 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafter Total Senior Secured Term Loans (1) $ 76.4 $ 76.4 $ 76.4 $ 3,457.4 $ 1,728.4 $ 2,108.4 $ 7,523.4 2022 Notes (2) 1,150.0 1,150.0 2024 Notes 1,200.0 1,200.0 2025 Notes 750.0 750.0 6.875% 2026 Notes 500.0 500.0 6.375% 2026 Notes 950.0 950.0 2026 Secured Notes 4,000.0 4,000.0 2027 Notes 550.0 550.0 Securitization Facility 350.0 350.0 Scheduled Interest Payments (3) 912.9 888.0 906.3 837.5 703.5 730.4 4,978.6 Government Refundable Advances 3.0 3.2 3.3 3.5 3.7 22.5 39.2 Operating Leases 22.3 31.5 17.2 14.1 12.5 27.8 125.4 Capital Leases 1.5 2.4 2.4 1.6 1.6 40.3 49.8 Pension Funding Minimums 9.1 7.8 7.6 7.7 7.8 39.5 79.5 Purchase Obligations 631.0 57.7 19.0 6.5 2.2 14.4 730.8 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 2,006.2 $ 1,067.0 $ 2,182.2 $ 4,328.3 $ 3,659.7 $ 9,733.3 $ 22,976.7 (1) The tranche E term loans mature in May 2025, the tranche F term loans mature in June 2023, and the tranche G term loans mature in August 2024.

(2) The 2022 Notes will be fully redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in connection with the issuance of $2,650.0 million of new 2027 notes. Since this transaction occurred after September 30, 2019, it is not reflected in the contractual obligations table. (3) Assumes that the variable interest rate on our tranche E, tranche F and tranche G borrowings under our Senior Secured Term Loans range from approximately 4.7% to 5.0% based on anticipated movements in the LIBO rate. In addition, interest payments include the impact of the existing interest rate swap and cap agreements described in Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements herein.
