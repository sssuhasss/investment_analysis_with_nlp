Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and ingot prices; production and shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt]) Overview Our Business Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange 43 Table of Contents (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and demand. Aluminum and alumina represent more than three-fourths of Alcoa revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners. Alcoa products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, and industrial applications. Alcoa is a global company operating in 31 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, the U.S. and Europe generated 52% and 27%, respectively, of Alcoa sales in 2009. In addition, Alcoa has investments and operating activities in Australia, Brazil, China, Iceland, Guinea, Russia, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies, laws and regulations, and other economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries. Management Review of 2009 and Outlook for the Future In 2009, management was faced with the challenge of preserving Alcoa future while navigating the Company through a global economic downturn that coupled an unprecedented decline in LME pricing levels (began in the second half of 2008) with a collapse in demand from aluminum product end markets. Management adopted a holistic response to this situation by initiating various actions, including: curtailing additional refinery and smelter capacity (necessitating further layoffs); instituting programs to identify procurement efficiencies, overhead rationalization, and working capital improvements; reducing the quarterly common stock dividend; and issuing new equity and debt instruments. All of these actions were aimed at reducing costs, improving cash levels, and preserving liquidity. Certain financial and nonfinancial information reflecting these challenges and management actions were as follows: Sales of $18,439 and a loss from continuing operations of $985, or $1.06 per diluted share; Cash from operations of $1,365 and cash on hand at the end of the year of $1,481, almost double the level at December 2008; Reduction in total debt of $759 and debt-to-capital ratio of 38.7%, a 380 basis point improvement from 2008; Capital expenditures of $1,622, a more than 50% reduction from 2008; The completion and start-up of the expanded refinery and new bauxite mine in Brazil, new lithographic sheet operations in Bohai (China), and a new can sheet and end and tab line in Russia; Secured long-term power contracts on approximately 2,000 kmt (Canada, Spain, and the U.S.) of the global smelting system (85% of system secured through at least 2025); Optimized Alcoa business and investment portfolio through the following actions: monetized the investment in Shining Prospect ($1,021); exchanged an equity interest in a soft alloy extrusion joint venture (Sapa AB) for full ownership of two smelters and an anode facility in Norway; acquired BHP Billiton interests in bauxite mines and a refinery in the Republic of Suriname; entered into an agreement with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (known as Ma aden ) to develop a complete industrial complex that will encompass the aluminum manufacturing process from bauxite mining to aluminum fabrication; and completed the divestiture of the Electronic and Electrical Solutions (EES) business. In 2010, management expects market conditions for aluminum products in certain end markets to improve, particularly in automotive and commercial transportation, while others are expected to decline, including aerospace, building and construction, and industrial gas turbines. Management is also projecting an increase in the consumption of primary aluminum, especially in China. On the cost side, increases in energy prices and continued currency movements are expected to be a challenge. Management is committed to achieving the following goals in 2010: securing and improving on the savings realized in 2009 from procurement, overhead, and working capital programs; continuing to strengthen the balance sheet using operating cash flows to further reduce debt levels; and 44 Table of Contents optimizing businesses for improved market conditions by continuing to bring the upstream operations down on the cost curve (e.g., the new complex in Saudi Arabia) and positioning the downstream operations in profitable markets. Results of Operations Earnings Summary Loss from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2009 was $985, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared with income from continuing operations of $229, or $0.27 per share, in 2008. The change of $1,214 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following: significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum; large volume decreases in the downstream segments; a charge associated with electricity pricing in Italy; a loss on the sale of an equity investment; charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Program; and higher depreciation and interest charges; all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses; the absence of the charges associated with the 2008 Restructuring Program; net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar; favorable LIFO (last in, first out) inventory adjustments; various discrete income tax benefits and a significant fluctuation in income taxes due to a change in the results of operations from pretax income to a pretax loss; a gain on the exchange of equity interests; a gain on the acquisition of an entity in the Republic of Suriname; and net income of various other nonoperating items. Income from continuing operations attributable to Alcoa for 2008 was $229, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with $2,814, or $3.22 per share, in 2007. The decrease in income from continuing operations was mostly due to the following: the absence of the gain related to the sale of Alcoa investment in Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco); charges for the 2008 Restructuring Program; continued increases in raw materials, energy, and other inputs; net unfavorable foreign currency movements; the absence of the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment for 10 months; and costs associated with a gas outage in Western Australia and a complete smelter curtailment in Rockdale, TX. These negative impacts were slightly offset by the absence of the following items that occurred in 2007: charges for the 2007 Restructuring Program; certain costs associated with the Rockdale, Tennessee, and Iceland smelters; and transaction costs and interest charges related to a potential business combination. Net loss attributable to Alcoa for 2009 was $1,151, or $1.23 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $74, or $0.10 per share, in 2008, and net income of $2,564, or $2.94 per share, in 2007. In 2009 and 2008, the net loss of $1,151 and $74 included a loss from discontinued operations of $166 and $303, respectively, all related to the EES business. In 2007, net income of $2,564 included a loss from discontinued operations of $250, comprised of a $243 loss related to the EES business and a $7 net loss of other discontinued businesses. In March 2009, Alcoa announced a series of operational and financial actions, which were in addition to those announced at the end of 2008, to significantly improve Alcoa cost structure and liquidity. Operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements. Financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.03 per share, which began with the dividend paid on May 25, 2009, and the issuance of 172.5 million shares of common stock and $575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded $1,438 in net proceeds. In late 2008, management made the decision to reduce Alcoa aluminum and alumina production in response to the significant economic downturn. As a result of this decision, reductions of 750 kmt, or 18%, of annualized output from Alcoa global smelting system were implemented (includes previous curtailment at Rockdale, TX in June 2008). Accordingly, reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by 1,500 kmt-per-year across the global refining system. The aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early 2009 as planned. Smelters in Rockdale (267 kmt-per-year) and Tennessee (215 kmt-per-year) were fully curtailed while another 268 kmt-per-year was partially curtailed at various other locations. The refinery in Point Comfort, TX was partially curtailed by approximately 1,500 kmt- per-year between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 (only approximately half of this amount remains curtailed as of December 31, 2009). In mid-2009, further action became 45 Table of Contents necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the Massena East, NY smelter (125 kmt-per-year) and partially curtail the Suralco (Suriname) refinery (480 kmt-per-year represented AWAC previous 55% ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt). In June 2008, Alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production (three of six operating potlines or 120 kmt) at its Rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with Rockdale onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that Alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues. In September 2008, Alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines, or 147 kmt, as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter, well-known issues regarding the cost and long-term reliability of the power supply, and overall market conditions. In 2008, the earnings impact of the idled potlines was $55 ($90 pretax). Alcoa is seeking damages and other relief from its power supplier through ongoing litigation. Additionally, in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges in 2008 of $31 ($48 pretax) mostly for the layoff of approximately 870 employees (see Restructuring and Other Charges below for additional information). Also in June 2008, a major gas supplier to Alcoa Western Australia refining operations (part of Alcoa of Australia) suffered a pipeline rupture and fire, which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers. The disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in Alcoa of Australia production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations. As a result, shortly thereafter, Alcoa of Australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts. During the second half of 2008, the supplier partially restored the gas supply to Alcoa of Australia (full restoration occurred in the first half of 2009). In addition, insurance recoveries of $52 were received in the second half of 2008. Net of insurance benefits, Alcoa earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was $49 ($102 before tax and noncontrolling interest) in 2008. The Alumina segment was impacted by $33 ($47 before tax) and the remaining impact of $29 ($55 before tax) was reflected in Corporate due to Alcoa captive insurance program. In 2009, additional insurance recoveries of $24 were received, which benefited the results of Alcoa by $10 ($24 before tax and noncontrolling interest) and the Alumina segment by $17 ($24 before tax). Alcoa of Australia is part of Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), which is 60% owned by Alcoa and 40% owned by Alumina Limited. Sales Sales for 2009 were $18,439 compared with sales of $26,901 in 2008, a decline of $8,462, or 31%. The decrease was primarily due to a drop in realized prices for alumina and aluminum, driven by significantly lower London Metal Exchange (LME) prices; volume declines in the downstream segments due to continued weak end markets; unfavorable foreign currency movements, mostly the result of a weaker euro and Australian dollar; and the absence of sales from the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment ($516 in 2008); all of which was slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in Norway. Sales for 2008 were $26,901 compared with sales of $29,280 in 2007, a decline of $2,379, or 8%. The decrease was driven mainly by the absence of 10 months of sales ($2,781) from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment, the absence of sales from the soft alloy extrusion business ($1,115 in 2007), and volume declines for most downstream businesses, especially related to the automotive and commercial transportation markets in North America and Europe. These negative impacts were principally offset by significantly higher primary aluminum volumes, mostly as a result of sales related to the production of the Iceland smelter for a full year, and favorable foreign currency movements, primarily due to a stronger euro and Australian dollar. Cost of Goods Sold COGS as a percentage of Sales was 91.7% in 2009 compared with 82.4% in 2008. The percentage was negatively impacted by significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum, lower demand in the downstream segments, and a charge related to a recent European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters in Italy ($250). These items were somewhat offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses, net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and positive LIFO adjustments. In 2009, Alcoa recognized $361 ($235 after-tax) in income due to the reductions in LIFO inventory quantities and the considerable drop in LME prices. Of this amount, 71% occurred in the second half of the year. During 2010, 46 Table of Contents management expects to maintain inventory levels comparable to 2009; however, this will not generate LIFO income in the first quarter of 2010 and is not expected to generate LIFO income for the remainder of 2010. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 82.4% in 2008 compared with 77.9% in 2007. The increase in the percentage was mainly the result of continued cost increases in raw materials, energy, and other inputs; unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker U.S. dollar; the production at the Iceland smelter that did not occur in 2007; and the impacts of the gas outage in Western Australia and the 2008 smelter curtailment at Rockdale. These items were primarily offset by the absence of the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment for 10 months (84.0%); the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business (97.1% in 2007); productivity improvements in most of the businesses within the Engineered Products and Solutions segment; and the absence of certain costs incurred in 2007 as a result of production curtailments associated with the Tennessee and Rockdale smelters and startup costs at the Iceland smelter, among others. Selling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses SG&A expenses were $1,009, or 5.5% of Sales, in 2009 compared with $1,167, or 4.3% of Sales, in 2008. The decline of $158 was primarily due to reductions in labor costs, mainly as a result of implemented severance programs; decreases in expenses for travel, contractors and consultants, information technology, selling and marketing, and various other administrative items as part of Alcoa cost reduction initiatives; the absence of the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment ($37 in 2008); and a decrease in bad debt expense; all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation, mostly the result of the plans improved performance, and an increase due to SG&A of the acquired smelters in Norway. SG&A expenses were $1,167, or 4.3% of sales, in 2008 compared with $1,444, or 4.9% of sales, in 2007. The decrease of $277 was mostly due to the absence of 10 months of expenses ($180) from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment; the absence of transaction costs related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($46); and the absence of expenses from the soft alloy extrusion business ($33 in 2007). Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses were $169 in 2009 compared with $246 in 2008 and $238 in 2007. The decline in 2009 as compared to 2008 was principally due to the implementation of Alcoa cost reduction initiatives and the absence of the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment ($3 in 2008). The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 was mainly driven by expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the Flat-Rolled Products segment and the Primary Metals segment, partially offset by the absence of 10 months of expenditures ($16) from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment. Provision for Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization The provision for DD&A was $1,311 in 2009 compared with $1,234 in 2008. The increase of $77, or 6%, was mostly due to the acquired smelters in Norway and assets placed into service during 2009, including the Juruti bauxite mine and S o Luis refinery in Brazil, the new Bohai (China) flat-rolled product facility, and a high-quality coated sheet line at the Samara (Russia) facility. These increases were slightly offset as a result of the cessation of DD&A, which began in January 2009, related to the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses due to the classification of these businesses as held for sale and a reduction in DD&A as a result of the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review, which was completed in mid-2008, of estimated useful lives ($11). The provision for DD&A was $1,234 in 2008 compared with $1,244 in 2007. The decline of $10, or 1%, was principally the result of the absence of nine months of depreciation from the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment ($89 in 2007), which was classified as held for sale, and the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of refining and smelting locations and various rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review of estimated useful lives completed during 2008 ($61). Offsetting these reductions was a significant increase ($83) in depreciation expense related to the Iceland smelter and Norway anode facility being in service for a full year and unfavorable foreign currency movements as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. 47 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 were comprised of the following: 2009 2008 2007 Asset impairments $ 54 $ 670 $ 214 Layoff costs 186 183 35 Other exit costs 37 109 47 Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs* (40 ) (23 ) (28 ) Restructuring and other charges $ 237 $ 939 $ 268 * Reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs resulted from changes in facts and circumstances that led to changes in estimated costs. Layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements, and the expected timetable for completion of the plans. 2009 Restructuring Program In 2009, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $237 ($151 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $177 ($121 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for the layoff of approximately 6,600 employees (2,980 in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment; 2,190 in the Flat-Rolled Products segment; 1,080 in the Primary Metals segment; 180 in the Alumina segment; and 170 in Corporate) to address the impact of the global economic downturn on Alcoa businesses and a $9 ($6 after-tax) curtailment charge due to the remeasurement of pension plans as a result of the workforce reductions; $41 ($20 after-tax) in adjustments to the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses held for sale due to unfavorable foreign currency movements for both businesses and a change in the estimated fair value for the Global Foil business and $13 ($11 after-tax) in other asset impairments; $18 ($12 after-tax) for the write-off of previously capitalized third-party costs related to potential business acquisitions due to the adoption of changes to accounting for business combinations and net costs of $19 ($10 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for various other items, such as accelerated depreciation and lease termination costs for shutdown facilities; and $40 ($29 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 4,400 of the 6,600 employees were terminated. Cash payments of $62 were made against the 2009 Restructuring Program layoff reserves in 2009. 2008 Restructuring Program In late 2008, Alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio, partly due to the economic downturn. Such actions included targeted reductions, curtailments, and plant closures and consolidations, which will reduce headcount by approximately 5,300, resulting in layoff charges of $138 ($98 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), asset impairments of $156 ($88 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), and other exit costs of $58 ($57 after-tax). The significant components of these actions were as follows: As a result of market conditions, the Primary Metals segment reduced production by 483 kmt and the Alumina segment reduced production by a total of 1,500 kmt (fully implemented in early 2009; further reductions occurred later in 2009). These production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately 1,110 positions totaling $23 in layoff costs. Asset impairments of $116 related to these two segments were also recognized, including the write off of $84 in engineering costs related to a 1,500 kmt planned expansion of Jamalco Clarendon, Jamaica refinery. The Flat-Rolled Products segment was restructured through the following actions: Restructuring and downsizing of the Mill Products businesses in Europe and North America, resulting in severance charges of $53 for the reduction of approximately 850 positions; Alignment of production with demand at operations in Russia, through the elimination of approximately 1,400 positions resulting in severance charges of $7; 48 Table of Contents The shutdown of the Foil business in Bohai, resulting in severance charges of $6 for the reduction of approximately 400 positions, asset impairments of $24, and other exits costs of $54, primarily related to lease termination costs. The Engineered Products and Solutions segment was restructured through the following actions: Exiting of the Auto Cast Wheel business, through the closure of the only remaining facility, which employed approximately 270, by June 2009 for severance costs of $2; Consolidation of operations in the Building and Construction Systems business to maximize operating efficiencies and align capacity with the decline in the commercial building and construction markets, resulting in severance charges of $6 for the elimination of approximately 400 positions; Alignment of production with demand across the Power and Propulsion business, resulting in the reduction of approximately 250 positions for a cost of $6; Optimization of the Global Hard Alloy Extrusion operations, resulting in severance charges of $13 for a headcount reduction of approximately 240 and asset impairments of $3 (previously reported as part of the Flat-Rolled Products segment see Segment Information); Other severance charges of $8 for the elimination of approximately 250 positions, asset impairments of $13, and other exit costs of $1. In order to reduce overhead serving various businesses, approximately 130 positions will be eliminated at Corporate, resulting in severance charges of $14 and other exits costs of $3. In addition to the above actions, Alcoa intends to sell its Global Foil (the Sabi nigo, Spain and Shanghai, China plants were sold in late 2009) and Transportation Products Europe businesses in order to streamline its portfolio. As a result of this decision, the assets and related liabilities of the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses were classified as held for sale. Asset impairments of $129 ($100 after-tax) and $52 ($49 after-tax) were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses, respectively. Also, Alcoa and Orkla ASA agreed to exchange their stakes in the Sapa AB and Elkem Aluminium ANS joint ventures. This portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of $333 ($223 after-tax) to reflect the estimated fair value of Alcoa investment in Sapa AB. Earlier in 2008, Alcoa recorded $48 ($31 after-tax) in charges, which consisted of $44 ($29 after-tax) for the layoff of approximately 870 employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and $4 ($2 after-tax) for other exit costs, associated with the complete production curtailment of the Rockdale, TX smelter (267 kmt) due to ongoing power supply issues with Rockdale onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that Alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues. Also during 2008, Alcoa recorded a loss of $43 ($32 after-tax) on the sale of its Packaging and Consumer businesses. The remaining net charges in 2008 were comprised of $1 ($1 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for layoff related to a reduction in headcount of approximately 30, $4 for other exit costs ($6 after-tax), and $23 ($15 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) for reversals of previously recorded costs, slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 5,900 of the 6,200 employees were terminated. Cash payments of $112 and $7 were made against the 2008 Restructuring Program layoff reserves in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 2007 Restructuring Program In 2007, Alcoa recorded Restructuring and other charges of $268 ($201 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), which were comprised of the following components: $257 ($174 after-tax) in asset impairments associated with a strategic review of certain businesses; a $62 ($23 after-tax) reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in 2006 related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business, which was contributed to a joint venture effective June 1, 2007; and $73 ($50 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) in net charges comprised of layoff charges of $35 ($26 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the elimination of approximately 400 positions and asset impairments of $19 ($12 after-tax) of various other businesses and facilities, 49 Table of Contents other exit costs of $47 ($31 after-tax and noncontrolling interests), primarily for accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of certain facilities in 2007 related to the 2006 Restructuring Program, and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs of $28 ($19 after-tax and noncontrolling interests) due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances. In April 2007, Alcoa announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for the potential disposition of the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment and the Automotive Castings business. In September 2007, management completed its review of strategic alternatives and determined that the best course of action was to sell the Packaging and Consumer and Automotive Castings businesses. As a result of this decision, the assets and related liabilities of the Packaging and Consumer and Automotive Castings businesses were classified as held for sale. Alcoa recorded impairment charges of $215 ($140 after-tax) related to the Packaging and Consumer businesses and $68 ($51 after-tax) for the Automotive Castings business to reflect the write-down of the carrying value of the assets of these businesses to their respective estimated fair values. In addition, Alcoa recorded a $464 discrete income tax charge related to goodwill associated with the planned sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses that would have been non-deductible for tax purposes under the transaction structure contemplated at the time. In November 2007, Alcoa completed the sale of the Automotive Castings business and recognized a loss of $4 ($2 after-tax). In December 2007, Alcoa agreed to sell the Packaging and Consumer businesses for $2,700 in cash, and reduced the impairment charge by $26 ($17 after-tax) and the discrete income tax charge by $322 as a result of the structure of the agreed upon sale (this sale was completed in 2008). As of December 31, 2008, the terminations associated with the 2007 restructuring program were essentially complete. Cash payments of $1 and $20 were made against the 2007 Restructuring Program layoff reserves in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Alcoa does not include Restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments. The pretax impact of allocating Restructuring and other charges to such results would have been as follows (prior period amounts presented were revised to reflect a change in segments see Segment Information): 2009 2008 2007 Alumina $ 5 $ 89 $ - Primary Metals 30 94 (2 ) Flat-Rolled Products 65 273 56 Engineered Products and Solutions 64 104 67 Packaging and Consumer - 45 189 Segment total 164 605 310 Corporate 73 334 (42 ) Total restructuring and other charges $ 237 $ 939 $ 268 Interest Expense Interest expense was $470 in 2009 compared with $407 in 2008, resulting in an increase of $63, or 15%. The increase was primarily due to a 10% higher average debt level, mostly the result of $575 in convertible notes issued in March 2009 and increased borrowings on loans in Brazil (began in April 2008) related to the Juruti, S o Lu s, and Estreito growth projects; and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs, mainly due to a $66 beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and $43 in fees paid for the $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (entered into in October 2008 and expired in October 2009); both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of Alcoa debt portfolio. Interest expense was $407 in 2008 compared with $401 in 2007, resulting in an increase of $6, or 1%. The increase was principally caused by a 22% higher average debt level, mostly due to the issuance of $1,500 in new senior notes in July 2008 and significantly higher commercial paper levels; and a decrease in capitalized interest ($32), primarily due to placing growth projects into service, such as the Iceland smelter and the Norway anode facility in 2007. These items were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($67) and a lower weighted-average effective interest rate, driven mainly by the decrease in LIBOR rates. 50 Table of Contents Other Income, net Other income, net was $161 in 2009 compared with $59 in 2008. The increase of $102 was mainly the result of a $188 gain on the Elkem/Sapa AB exchange transaction; favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar; net gains related to the improvement in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance; an $92 gain related to the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname; and a $22 gain on the sale of property in Vancouver, WA. These positive impacts were partially offset by a $182 realized loss on the sale of the Shining Prospect investment; a decline in the value of mark-to-market derivative contracts; a decrease in equity income related to Alcoa share of the results of Elkem, Sapa AB, and Shining Prospect prior to the exchange and sale of these investments; the absence of a 2008 negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment ($39); and an estimated loss on excess power at the Ferndale, WA smelter ($30). Other income, net was $59 in 2008 compared with $1,920 in 2007. The decrease of $1,861 was mostly due to the absence of the $1,754 gain related to the sale of Alcoa investment in Chalco. Other items impacting this decline were losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets; unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; the absence of dividend income from Alcoa former stake in Chalco; and the absence of a non-recurring foreign currency gain in Russia; all of which was partially offset by mark-to-market gains on derivative contracts and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior Alcoa divestiture ($39). Income Taxes Alcoa effective tax rate was 38.3% (benefit on a loss) in 2009 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a $12 income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and the following discrete tax items: a $71 benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment; a $34 benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets; a $31 benefit for a tax rate change (from 15% to 18%) in Iceland; a $31 benefit related to a Canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in U.S. dollars; a $10 benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the Global Foil business than originally anticipated; and a $7 benefit related to the Elkem/Sapa AB exchange transaction. Partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in Italy, which included a $41 valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows: $250 related to a recent decision by the European Commission on electricity pricing, $15 for environmental remediation, and $15 for layoffs. Alcoa effective tax rate was 43.2% (provision on income) in 2008 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to the following income tax charges: $73 for the asset impairments included in the 2008 restructuring program; $28 due to a decrease in deferred tax assets of the Iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change (from 18% to 15%); a net $19 associated with the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses, mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated, somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations. These charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a $20 discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the 2007 U.S. income tax return. Alcoa effective tax rate was 33.8% (provision on income) in 2007 compared with the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower taxes on foreign income, mostly offset by a discrete income tax charge of $142 related to goodwill that is non-deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses. Management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2010 will be approximately 35%. However, changes in the current economic environment, tax legislation, currency fluctuations, and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate significantly. Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $61 in 2009 compared with $221 in 2008. The decline of $160 was principally due to lower earnings at AWAC, which is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. The lower earnings at AWAC were mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices, 51 Table of Contents somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and the absence of the impact of the 2008 gas outage in Western Australia. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $221 in 2008 compared with $365 in 2007. The decrease of $144 was mostly due to lower earnings at AWAC attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy, unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, and the impact of the gas outage in Western Australia. Loss From Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations in 2009 was $166 comprised of a $129 ($168 pretax) loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business, a $9 ($13 pretax) loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the EES business, and the remainder was for the operational results of the EES business prior to the divestitures. Loss from discontinued operations in 2008 was $303 comprised of asset impairments of $162 ($225 pretax) to reflect the estimated fair value of the EES business and a net operating loss of $141 ($199 pretax), which included restructuring charges of $39 ($53 pretax) for headcount reductions of approximately 6,200 and a charge of $16 ($25 pretax) for obsolete inventory. Loss from discontinued operations in 2007 was $250 comprised of a $243 loss related to the EES business, including severance charges of $36 ($53 pretax) for headcount reductions of approximately 5,900, as part of a strategic business review to restructure EES, and impairment charges of $93 ($133 pretax) for goodwill and $60 ($74 pretax) for various fixed assets, as the forecasted future earnings and cash flows of the EES business no longer supported the carrying values of such assets; an $11 loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the 2006 sale of the home exteriors business; and net operating income of $4 for other discontinued businesses. In late 2008, Alcoa reclassified the EES business to discontinued operations based on the decision to sell the business. The Consolidated Financial Statements for all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the EES business in discontinued operations. The sale of the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business was completed in June 2009 and the sale of the electronics portion of the EES business was completed in December 2009. The results of the Engineered Products and Solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the EES business into discontinued operations. Segment Information In May 2009, management approved the movement of Alcoa hard alloy extrusions business from the Flat-Rolled Products segment to the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. This move was made to capture market, customer, and manufacturer synergies through the combination of the hard alloy extrusions business with the power and propulsion and forgings businesses. Prior period amounts were reclassified to reflect this change. Alcoa operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions (the Packaging and Consumer segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 2008). Segment performance under Alcoa management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is the after-tax operating income (ATOI) of each segment. Certain items such as the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest income and expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gains/losses are excluded from segment ATOI. Segment assets exclude, among others, cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes, goodwill not allocated to businesses for segment reporting purposes, corporate fixed assets, LIFO reserves, and assets classified as held for sale related to discontinued operations. 52 Table of Contents ATOI for all reportable segments totaled $(234) in 2009, $2,199 in 2008, and $3,162 in 2007. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 for additional information. The following discussion provides shipments, sales, and ATOI data for each reportable segment and production data for the Alumina and Primary Metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Alumina 2009 2008 2007 Alumina production (kmt) 14,265 15,256 15,084 Third-party alumina shipments (kmt) 8,655 8,041 7,834 Third-party sales $ 2,161 $ 2,924 $ 2,709 Intersegment sales 1,534 2,803 2,448 Total sales $ 3,695 $ 5,727 $ 5,157 ATOI $ 112 $ 727 $ 956 This segment consists of Alcoa worldwide alumina system, including the mining of bauxite, which is then refined into alumina. Alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers that process it into industrial chemical products. A portion of this segments third-party sales are completed through the use of agents, alumina traders, and distributors. Slightly more than half of Alcoa alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide, while the remainder is used internally. In 2009, alumina production decreased by 991 kmt compared to 2008. The reduction was mostly the result of the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009, which included approximately 1,500 kmt-per-year at the Point Comfort, TX refinery (only approximately half of this amount remains curtailed as of December 31, 2009) and approximately 480 kmt-per-year at the Suralco (Suriname) refinery (represented AWAC previous 55% ownership interest at the time of curtailment total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt). Partially offsetting the curtailments was increased production at the following refineries (all set production records in 2009): Jamalco (Jamaica), Pinjarra and Wagerup (Australia), and S o Luis (Brazil), where ramp-up of the 2,100 kmt expansion began in late 2009. Production also increased due to additional capacity of approximately 600 kmt from the acquisition (total acquired was approximately 990 kmt 390 was curtailed) of BHP Billiton 45% interest in Suralco on July 31, 2009 (100% of the Suralco refinery operations were reflected in this segment beginning August 1, 2009). In 2008, alumina production increased by 172 kmt compared to 2007 with the largest increase occurring at the Pinjarra refinery due to the continued positive effects of the efficiency upgrade expansion completed in 2006. In late 2008, Alcoa reduced production at its Point Comfort refinery by 550 kmt-per-year due to negative market conditions; however, production for the year slightly exceeded the refinery 2007 production performance. Third-party sales for the Alumina segment declined 26% in 2009 compared with 2008, principally due to a 35% drop in realized prices, driven by significantly lower LME prices, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker Australian dollar, both of which were somewhat offset by an increase in volumes. Third-party sales for this segment rose 8% in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily related to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger Australian dollar and increases of 3% and 2% in third-party shipments and realized prices, respectively. Intersegment sales for the Alumina segment dropped 45% in 2009 compared with 2008, mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a reduction in demand from the Primary Metals segment. Intersegment sales for this segment climbed 15% in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly as a result of a 6% increase in volumes and higher realized prices. ATOI for the Alumina segment declined 85% in 2009 compared with 2008, principally due to the significant drop in realized prices; a tax settlement related to an equity investment in Brazil ($30); and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of growth projects placed into service mid-to-late 2009 in Brazil (Juruti bauxite mine and S o Luis refinery); all of which was partially offset by net procurement and overhead cost savings across most regions, favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, a $60 gain recognized on the acquisition of BHP Billiton interest 53 Table of Contents in Suralco, and a positive impact related to the 2008 gas outage in Western Australia (absence of $69 in costs partially offset by $19 less in insurance recoveries). ATOI for this segment decreased 24% in 2008 compared with 2007, mostly due to significant cost increases for bauxite, caustic soda, fuel oil, and natural gas; unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; and the impact of the gas outage in Western Australia ($33 net of insurance benefits); all of which was partially offset by higher realized prices, productivity improvements, and a positive impact due to the curtailment of production at the Point Comfort refinery. In 2010, increased benefits from cost savings initiatives are expected and improved customer demand is anticipated, especially in China as indicated by the significant increase in shipments in late 2009. Also, higher production levels due to the start-up of the Juruti bauxite mine (total additional 2,600 kmt of bauxite, Alcoa share is 1,560 kmt) and S o Luis refinery (total additional alumina production of 2,100 kmt, Alcoa share is 948 kmt) are expected; while full production at these facilities will result in higher depreciation expense. Primary Metals 2009 2008 2007 Aluminum production (kmt) 3,564 4,007 3,693 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 3,038 2,926 2,291 Alcoa average realized price per metric ton of aluminum $ 1,856 $ 2,714 $ 2,784 Third-party sales $ 5,252 $ 8,021 $ 6,576 Intersegment sales 1,836 3,927 4,994 Total sales $ 7,088 $ 11,948 $ 11,570 ATOI $ (612 ) $ 931 $ 1,445 This segment consists of Alcoa worldwide smelter system. Primary Metals receives alumina, primarily from the Alumina segment, and produces primary aluminum used by Alcoa fabricating businesses, as well as sold to external customers, aluminum traders, and commodity markets. Results from the sale of aluminum powder, scrap, and excess power are also included in this segment, as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts. Primary aluminum produced by Alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices. The sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90% of this segment third-party sales. At December 31, 2009, Alcoa had 1,234 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,813 kmt. In 2009, idle capacity increased by 480 kmt compared to 2008 due to the completion of targeted curtailment reductions, including 215 kmt at the Tennessee smelter, 125 kmt at the Massena East, NY smelter, and 140 kmt at various other smelters, in response to the significant decline in LME prices and aluminum demand both as a result of the global economic downturn. Base capacity rose by 282 kmt at December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008 due to the March 31, 2009 acquisition of two smelters in Norway, in which Alcoa previously held a 50% equity interest. At December 31, 2008, Alcoa had 754 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4,531 kmt. In 2008, idle capacity increased by 302 kmt as compared to 2007 due to the complete production curtailment at Rockdale, TX (267 kmt) and partial curtailments of approximately 35 kmt related to other smelters, all of which were the result of negative market conditions. Base capacity dropped by 42 kmt at December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007, primarily driven by 53 kmt permanently curtailed in November 2008 at the Baie Comeau smelter as part of a modernization program initiated early due to the global economic downturn. In 2009, aluminum production declined 443 kmt, mainly the result of the effects of smelter curtailments that began mid-2008, including the smelters in Rockdale (267 kmt-per-year), Tennessee (215 kmt-per-year), and Massena East (125 kmt-per-year), all of which was partially offset by an increase in production at the Iceland smelter (344 kmt-per-year), as this smelter was not at full capacity until April 2008, and the acquisition of the Lista (94 kmt-per-year) and Mosj en (188 kmt-per-year) smelters in Norway. In 2008, aluminum production increased by 314 kmt, mostly due to the Iceland smelter, as 2008 was its first full year of production; the Ferndale smelter as a result of the restart of additional pots early in the year; and the Tennessee smelter; all of which was slightly offset by a reduction 54 Table of Contents at the Rockdale smelter due to Alcoa decision to curtail all production at this facility until competitive market conditions return (267-kmt-per-year). In late 2008, Alcoa started partial production curtailments at various smelters, including Ferndale and Baie Comeau, Quebec, resulting in an additional decline of 350 kmt-per-year. Third-party sales for the Primary Metals segment decreased 35% in 2009 compared with 2008, mostly the result of a 32% drop in realized prices, driven by a 35% decline in LME prices, slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in Norway. Third-party sales for this segment climbed 22% in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly due to higher volumes, primarily the result of the sales related to the production from the Iceland smelter, shipments made to the Packaging and Consumer businesses subsequent to their divestiture in 2008, and shipments made in the first half of 2008 to the Sapa AB joint venture (shipments to Alcoa soft alloy extrusion business were included in intersegment sales in the first half of 2007), somewhat offset by lower realized prices of 3%. Intersegment sales for the Primary Metals segment declined 53% in 2009 compared with 2008, mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a decline in volume due to lower demand from the downstream segments. Intersegment sales for this segment decreased 21% in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly as a result of lower demand from Alcoa downstream businesses, the absence of 10 months of shipments to the Packaging and Consumer businesses that occurred in 2007, and the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in 2007. ATOI for the Primary Metals segment declined $1,543 in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to the significant drop in realized prices; a charge related to a recent European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters in Italy ($250); a decline in intersegment sales volume; the impact of curtailing operations; and additional power costs related to smelters in Italy as a result of the termination of the then existing power tariff structure under legislative authority of the Italian Parliament ($15); all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all regions; lower costs for alumina; favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar; and a gain related to the acquisition of two smelters in Norway ($112). ATOI for this segment dropped 36% in 2008 compared with 2007, principally related to higher alumina, carbon, and energy costs; increased spending on repairs and maintenance, outside services, and labor; lower realized prices; the impact of the 2008 curtailment of all production at Rockdale ($55); and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar. These negative impacts were partially offset by the absence of costs incurred in 2007 associated with the following: the start-up of the Iceland smelter, the smelter production curtailment of one of the potlines in Rockdale, and the smelter curtailment associated with the power outage in Tennessee. In 2010, continued benefits from cost savings initiatives are expected; however, two smelters in Italy (Fusina and Portovesme 194 kmt-per-year) may be fully curtailed due to uneconomical power rates. Flat-Rolled Products 2009 2008 2007 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 1,831 2,221 2,358 Third-party sales $ 6,069 $ 8,966 $ 9,349 Intersegment sales 113 218 248 Total sales $ 6,182 $ 9,184 $ 9,597 ATOI $ (49 ) $ (3 ) $ 178 This segment principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate, sheet, and foil. This segment includes rigid container sheet (RCS), which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans. Seasonal increases in RCS sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year. This segment also includes sheet and plate used in the transportation, building and construction, and distribution markets (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables), which is sold directly to customers and through distributors. Approximately one-third of the third-party sales in this segment consist of RCS, while the remaining two-thirds of third-party sales are derived from sheet and plate and foil used in 55 Table of Contents industrial markets. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of RCS, sheet, and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Third-party sales for the Flat-Rolled Products segment declined 32% in 2009 compared with 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a drop in prices, attributable to unfavorable changes in the variable components of certain customer contracts, and a reduction in volumes across most businesses, both of which were mostly the result of weak end markets in Europe and North America, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro and Australian dollar. Third-party sales for this segment decreased 4% in 2008 compared with 2007. The decline was principally due to lower volumes across all businesses, mainly the result of weak end markets in North America and Europe, partially offset by positive foreign currency movements, mostly due to a stronger euro, and a favorable pricing and product mix. ATOI for the Flat-Rolled Products segment fell $46 in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily as a result of reduced volumes across most businesses, the previously mentioned drop in prices, and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the new coating line commissioned in Samara (Russia) and the new flat-rolled product facility in Bohai (China). All of these items were mostly offset by procurement and overhead cost savings and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar. ATOI for this segment declined $181 in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly the result of continued higher direct materials, energy, and other cost increases and lower volumes across all businesses, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. In 2010, continued benefits from cost savings initiatives are anticipated while higher energy costs are expected. Also, can sheet volumes are expected to decline significantly in North America, the largest market for can sheet, due to a change in pricing strategy, which will allow cost increases to be passed on to customers. The decision to reduce volumes, particularly in the first quarter, will provide longer-term profitability for this business. Further, management continues to explore divestiture alternatives for the remaining Global Foil business (the Sabi nigo, Spain and Shanghai, China plants were sold in late 2009). Engineered Products and Solutions 2009 2008 2007 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) 180 257 290 Third-party sales $ 4,689 $ 6,199 $ 5,834 ATOI $ 315 $ 533 $ 435 This segment includes titanium, aluminum, and super alloy investment castings; forgings and fasteners; aluminum wheels; integrated aluminum structural systems; and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, commercial transportation, and power generation markets. These products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Additionally, hard alloy extrusions products, which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors, serve the distribution, aerospace, automotive, and commercial transportation markets. Third-party sales for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment declined 24% in 2009 compared with 2008. The decrease was mostly due to lower volumes (aluminum and nonaluminum) across all businesses because of weak end markets, lower pricing in the building and construction sector, and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro. Third-party sales for this segment increased 6% in 2008 compared with 2007. The improvement was primarily due to higher demand in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets; favorable pricing in the building and construction market; positive foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro; and the addition of two fastener businesses acquired in early 2008; all of which was partially offset by significant volume declines in the commercial transportation market. ATOI for the Engineered Products and Solutions segment fell 41% in 2009 compared with 2008, principally the result of lower volumes across all businesses and lower pricing, partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings 56 Table of Contents realized in all businesses. ATOI for this segment climbed 23% in 2008 compared with 2007, mainly due to continued strong demand and productivity improvements in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets, favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro, and the positive contribution of the acquired fastener businesses, all of which was somewhat offset by significantly lower volumes in the commercial transportation market. In 2010, continued benefits from cost savings initiatives are anticipated; however, weak end markets and destocking in the aerospace fastener and industrial gas turbine markets are expected to continue. Also, management continues to explore divestiture alternatives for the Transportation Products Europe business. Packaging and Consumer 2009 2008 2007 Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) - 19 157 Third-party sales $ - $ 516 $ 3,288 ATOI $ - $ 11 $ 148 The businesses within this segment were sold to Rank Group Limited in 2008; therefore, this segment no longer contains any operations. Prior to the sale of these businesses, this segment included consumer, foodservice, and flexible packaging products; food and beverage closures; and plastic sheet and film for the packaging industry. The principal products in this segment included aluminum foil; plastic wraps and bags; plastic beverage and food closures; flexible packaging products; thermoformed plastic containers; and extruded plastic sheet and film. Consumer products were marketed under brands including Reynolds Wrap , Diamond , Baco , and Cut-Rite . Seasonal increases generally occurred in the second and fourth quarters of the year for such products as consumer foil and plastic wraps and bags, while seasonal slowdowns for closures generally occurred in the fourth quarter of the year. Products were generally sold directly to customers, consisting of supermarkets, beverage companies, food processors, retail chains, and commercial foodservice distributors. Reconciliation of ATOI to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Alcoa Items required to reconcile segment ATOI to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa include: the impact of LIFO inventory accounting; interest income and expense; noncontrolling interests; corporate expense (general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities, along with depreciation and amortization on corporate-owned assets); restructuring and other charges; discontinued operations; and other items, including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments, differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate, the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gains/losses. The following table reconciles total segment ATOI to consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa: 2009 2008 2007 Total segment ATOI $ (234 ) $ 2,199 $ 3,162 Unallocated amounts (net of tax): Impact of LIFO 235 (7 ) (24 ) Interest income 12 35 40 Interest expense (306 ) (265 ) (261 ) Noncontrolling interests (61 ) (221 ) (365 ) Corporate expense (304 ) (328 ) (388 ) Restructuring and other charges (155 ) (693 ) (201 ) Discontinued operations (166 ) (303 ) (250 ) Other (172 ) (491 ) 851 Consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa $ (1,151 ) $ (74 ) $ 2,564 57 Table of Contents The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net loss attributable to Alcoa for 2009 compared with 2008 consisted of: a $242 change in the Impact of LIFO due to lower prices for alumina and metal, both of which were driven by a significant drop in LME prices, and reductions in LIFO inventory quantities, which caused a partial liquidation of the lower cost LIFO inventory base; a $41 increase in Interest expense, primarily due to a 10% higher average debt level, mostly the result of $575 in convertible notes issued in March 2009 and increased borrowings on loans in Brazil (began in April 2008) related to the Juruti, S o Lu s, and Estreito growth projects; and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs, mainly due to a $66 beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and $43 in fees paid for the $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (entered into in October 2008 and expired in October 2009); both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of Alcoa debt portfolio; a $160 decrease in Noncontrolling interests, principally due to lower earnings at AWAC, mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices, somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and the absence of the impact of the 2008 gas outage in Western Australia; a $24 decline in Corporate expense, primarily due to reductions in labor costs, mainly as a result of implemented severance programs; and decreases in expenses for travel, contractors and consultants, information technology, and various other administrative items as part of Alcoa cost reduction initiatives; all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation, mostly the result of the plans improved performance; a $538 change in Restructuring and other charges, reflecting, in 2009, $20 in adjustments to the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses held for sale due to unfavorable foreign currency movements for both businesses and a change in the estimated fair value for the Global Foil business; $12 for the write-off of previously capitalized third-party costs related to potential business acquisitions due to the adoption of changes to accounting for business combinations; and the remainder for the layoff of approximately 6,600 employees to address the impact of the global economic downturn on Alcoa businesses and a related curtailment charge due to the remeasurement of pension plans as a result of the workforce reductions, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and lease termination costs for shutdown facilities, and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances; compared with, in 2008, $372 in asset impairments to reflect the estimated fair values of Alcoa investment in Sapa AB and the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses, as a result of management decision to divest these assets; a $32 loss on the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses; and the remainder for the layoff of approximately 6,200 employees, additional asset impairments, and other exit costs due to the global economic downturn and curtailed operations, and the reversal of previously recorded costs, slightly more than half of which related to a shutdown facility; a $137 change in Discontinued operations, reflecting a $124 loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the EES business, a $13 loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the EES business, and the remainder was for the operational results of the EES business prior to the divestitures in 2009, compared with asset impairments of $162 to reflect the estimated fair value of the EES business and a net operating loss of $141, which included restructuring charges of $39 for headcount reductions of approximately 6,200 and a charge of $16 for obsolete inventory, for EES in 2008; and a $319 change in Other, mainly due to income tax benefits related to the difference in the consolidated effective tax rate and tax rates applicable to the segments, including various discrete income tax items, favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger U.S. dollar, and a $21 adjustment for the finalization of the estimated fair value of the Sapa AB joint venture, all of which was partially offset by a $118 realized loss on the sale of the Shining Prospect investment and the absence of a 2008 negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment ($24). 58 Table of Contents The significant changes in the reconciling items between total segment ATOI and consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Alcoa for 2008 compared with 2007 consisted of: a $4 increase in Interest expense, principally caused by a 22% higher average debt level, mostly due to the issuance of $1,500 in new senior notes in July 2008 and significantly higher commercial paper levels; and a decrease in capitalized interest ($21), primarily due to placing growth projects into service, such as the Iceland smelter and the Norway anode facility in 2007; both of which were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($43) and a lower weighted-average effective interest rate, driven mainly by the decrease in LIBOR rates; a $144 decrease in Noncontrolling interests, mostly due to lower earnings at AWAC, attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy, unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar, and the impact of the gas outage in Western Australia; a $60 decline in Corporate expense, principally due to the absence of transaction costs related to the 2007 offer for Alcan Inc. ($30); a $492 change in Restructuring and other charges, reflecting, in 2008, $372 in asset impairments to reflect the estimated fair values of Alcoa investment in Sapa AB and the Global Foil and Transportation Products Europe businesses, as a result of management decision to divest these assets; a $32 loss on the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses; and the remainder for the layoff of approximately 6,200 employees, additional asset impairments, and other exit costs due to the global economic downturn and curtailed operations, and the reversal of previously recorded costs, slightly more than half of which related to a shutdown facility; compared with, in 2007, $174 in asset impairments associated with a strategic review of the Packaging and Consumer and Automotive Castings businesses; a $23 reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in 2006 related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business; and the remainder for the layoff of approximately 400 employees, asset impairments of various other businesses and facilities, other exit costs, primarily for accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of certain facilities in 2007 related to the 2006 Restructuring Program, and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances; a $53 change in Discontinued operations, mainly due to a $51 higher net operating loss of the EES business; and a $1,342 change in Other, mostly due to the following: the absence of a $1,140 gain on the sale of the Chalco investment; a net income tax charge of $100 for various items; losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets; and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker U.S. dollar; all of which was somewhat offset by the absence of a $142 discrete income tax charge related to goodwill that is non-deductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses; mark-to-market gains on derivative contracts; and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior Alcoa divestiture ($24). Environmental Matters See the Environmental Matters section of Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Alcoa takes a very disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet. In 2009, management continued to face the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the Company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively due to the global economic downturn. In response to changes in the economic markets across the globe in the second half of 2008, management initiated the following actions to conserve cash and preserve liquidity: greater scrutiny over the daily management of Alcoa cash 59 Table of Contents position; higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels; targeted headcount reductions across the globe; a global salary and hiring freeze; suspension of the existing share repurchase program; and the addition of a new 364-day $1,900 revolving credit facility (expired in October 2009). A number of changes were also made to Alcoa capital expenditures strategy as follows: capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically; growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible; and all non-critical capital expenditures were stopped. Capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain Alcoa compliance with the law, keep a facility operating, or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs. The planned sale or shutdown of various businesses contributed positively to Alcoa liquidity position in 2009. In March 2009, Alcoa announced an additional series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve the Company cost structure and liquidity. Operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements. Financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.03 per share, which began with the dividend paid on May 25, 2009, and the issuance of 172.5 million shares of common stock and $575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded $1,438 in net proceeds. Along with the foregoing actions, cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover Alcoa current operational and business needs. For a discussion of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Cash from Operations Cash from operations in 2009 was $1,365 compared with $1,234 in 2008, resulting in an increase of $131, or 11%. The improvement of $131 is principally related to a $1,639 cash inflow associated with working capital, $395 in lower pension contributions, and a positive change of $103 in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, all of which was mostly offset by significantly lower earnings (including the effects of non-cash income and expenses) and $147 in cash used for discontinued operations. The components of the change in working capital were as follows: a $443 decrease in receivables, primarily as a result of lower sales across all businesses and heightened collection efforts; a $1,611 reduction in inventories, mostly due to lower levels of inventory on-hand in response to a significant drop in demand, curtailed production at Alcoa refineries and smelters, and reduced costs for certain raw materials; a $223 decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets; a $653 decrease in accounts payable, trade, principally the result of fewer purchasing needs and declining commodity prices; a $187 increase in accrued expenses, mainly driven by a charge related to a recent European Commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters; and a decline of $172 in taxes, including income taxes, mostly due to the change from an operating income position to an operating loss position. In 2010, Alcoa estimates that a payment in the range of $300 to $500 will be required related to the aforementioned European Commission decision. Additionally, Alcoa expects to receive a U.S. federal income tax refund of $300 to $350 for the carryback of its 2009 net operating loss to the 2007 and 2006 tax years. Cash from operations in 2008 was $1,234 compared with $3,111 in 2007, resulting in a decrease of $1,877, or 60%. The decline of $1,877 was primarily due to a decrease in earnings (including the effects of non-cash income and expenses); a $779 cash outflow associated with working capital; $201 in higher pension contributions; and the absence of $93 in cash received on a long-term aluminum supply contract. These cash outflows were slightly offset by $97 in cash provided from discontinued operations. The components of the $779 change in working capital are as follows: a $142 increase in receivables, primarily as a result of improved sales from most businesses not classified as held for sale; a $522 increase in inventories, mostly due to higher costs of raw materials and other inputs; a $37 decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets; a $156 decrease in accounts payable, trade; a $209 decrease in accrued expenses; and a $213 increase in taxes, including taxes on income. Financing Activities Cash provided from financing activities was $37 in 2009 compared with cash provided from financing activities of $1,478 in 2008 and cash used for financing activities of $1,538 in 2007. 60 Table of Contents The source of cash in 2009 was primarily due to $1,049 in additions to long-term debt, mainly driven by net proceeds of $562 from the issuance of $575 in convertible notes and $394 in borrowings under loans that support the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project in Brazil; net proceeds of $876 from the issuance of 172.5 million shares of common stock; and net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $340, principally related to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; all of which was mostly offset by a $1,535 decrease in outstanding commercial paper, partly due to tightening in the credit markets and a reduction in market availability as a result of the change in Alcoa credit ratings in early 2009; $228 in dividends paid to shareholders; a $292 net change in short-term borrowings ($1,300 was borrowed and repaid under Alcoa $1,900 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility in early 2009 and $255 in new loans to support Alcoa Alum nio export operations was borrowed and repaid during 2009), mostly the result of repayments of working capital loans in Spain and Asia and a $155 decrease in accounts payable settlement arrangements; and payments on long-term debt of $156, including $97 related to the loans in Brazil for growth projects. The source of cash in 2008 was principally the result of $2,253 in additions to long-term debt, mainly driven by net proceeds of $1,489 from the July 2008 public debt offering and $721 in borrowings under the loans in Brazil for growth projects; a $679 increase in outstanding commercial paper to support operations and capital spending; net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $348, principally related to Alumina Limited share of AWAC; and $177 in proceeds from employees exercising their stock options; all of which was partially offset by $1,082 for the repurchase of common stock; $556 in dividends paid to shareholders; payments on long-term debt of $204, mainly due to a repayment of $150 for 6.625% Notes due March 2008; and a $96 net change in short-term borrowings, mostly the result of a $78 decrease in accounts payable settlement arrangements. The use of cash in 2007 was primarily due to $2,496 for the repurchase of common stock; payments on long-term debt of $873, primarily related to the January 2007 purchase of $333 of outstanding 4.25% Notes due August 2007 and the repayment of the remaining $459 of outstanding 4.25% Notes in August 2007; a $617 decrease in outstanding commercial paper, mostly due to the repayment of commercial paper with proceeds from the issuance of new long-term debt; and $590 in dividends paid to shareholders; all of which was partially offset by $2,050 in additions to long-term debt, principally due to proceeds of $1,994 from the issuance of new 5.55% Notes due 2017, 5.9% Notes due 2027, and 5.95% Notes due 2037; $835 in proceeds from employees exercising their stock options; and net cash received from noncontrolling interests of $106, principally related to Alumina Limited share of AWAC. Alcoa maintains a Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2007 (the Credit Agreement ), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. The Credit Agreement provides a $3,250 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Alcoa, including support of Alcoa commercial paper program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Alcoa may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the Credit Facility, not to exceed $500 in aggregate principal amount, and may also request the issuance of letters of credit, subject to a letter of credit sub-limit of $500 under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility matures on October 2, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Alcoa may make two one-year extension requests during the term of the Credit Facility, with any extension being subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. In order to maintain the Credit Facility, Alcoa pays a fee of 0.125% per annum, based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2009, of the total commitment. The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Alcoa. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. Loans will bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Alcoa outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. The applicable margin on LIBOR loans will be 0.475% per annum based on Alcoa long-term debt ratings as of December 31, 2009. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. 61 Table of Contents The Credit Agreement includes the following covenants, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) limitations on Alcoa ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money, (c) limitations on Alcoa ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, and (d) limitations on Alcoa ability to change the nature of its business. The obligation of Alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such Events of Default include, among others, (a) Alcoa failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Alcoa in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Alcoa breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Alcoa. In July 2008, Alcoa increased the capacity of the Credit Facility by $175 as provided for under the Credit Agreement. In October 2008, Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (LCPI), a lender under the Credit Agreement with $150 in commitments, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. It is not certain if LCPI will honor its obligations under the Credit Agreement. The total capacity of the Credit Facility, excluding LCPI commitment, is $3,275. There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In January 2008, Alcoa entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA-1) with two financial institutions. RCA-1 provided a $1,000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF-1), with a stated maturity of March 28, 2008. RCA-1 contained a provision that if there were amounts borrowed under RCF-1 at the time Alcoa received the proceeds from the sale of the Packaging and Consumer businesses, the company must use the net cash proceeds to prepay the amount outstanding under RCF-1. Additionally, upon Alcoa receipt of such proceeds, the lenders commitments under RCF-1 would be reduced by a corresponding amount, up to the total commitments then in effect under RCF-1, regardless of whether there was an amount outstanding under RCF-1. In February 2008, Alcoa borrowed $1,000 under RCF-1 and used the proceeds to reduce outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. Subsequent to the $1,000 borrowing, Alcoa completed the sale of its Packaging and Consumer businesses in February 2008. As a result, Alcoa also repaid the $1,000 under RCF-1 in February 2008, and the lenders commitments under RCF-1 were reduced to zero effectively terminating RCA-1. Also in January 2008, Alcoa entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA-2) with LCPI, as administrative agent, and Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank (LBCB), as lender. RCA-2 provided a $1,000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF-2), which would have matured on January 31, 2009. In October 2008, LCPI filed for bankruptcy protection under section 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result, in October 2008, Alcoa gave notice in accordance with the provisions of RCA-2 to permanently terminate in whole LBCB total commitments under RCF-2 effective October 30, 2008. To Alcoa knowledge, LBCB did not file for bankruptcy protection. On October 14, 2008, Alcoa entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (RCA-3) with a syndicate of lenders. RCA-3 provided a $1,150 senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF-3), which matured on October 12, 2009. In October and November 2008, Alcoa increased the capacity of RCF-3 by $500 and $250, respectively, as provided for under RCA-3. Alcoa paid a total of $43 in financing costs, which were deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the facility, for the initial capacity under RCF-3 and for the $750 in increased capacity. In early 2009, Alcoa borrowed $1,300 under RCF-3 to support its operations during the global economic downturn. The $1,300 was repaid on March 24, 2009 with the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and common stock. There were no amounts outstanding under RCF-3 at December 31, 2008. In March 2008, Alcoa filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance. This shelf registration statement replaced Alcoa existing shelf registration statement. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, $2,075 and $1,500, respectively, in senior debt securities were issued under the current shelf registration statement. 62 Table of Contents On February 10, 2009, Standard and Poor Ratings Services (S&P) changed its long-term debt rating of Alcoa from BBB+ to BBB- and its short-term debt rating from A-2 to A-3. S&P rating report stated that the changes in Alcoa ratings reflect uncertainties regarding the length and depth of the ongoing economic downturn; expectations of a long, slow economic recovery; S&P belief that Alcoa credit metrics will deteriorate significantly during 2009; and S&P concerns regarding Alcoa liquidity position. S&P removed all ratings from negative creditwatch; however, the current outlook remains negative based on expected weak earnings in 2009 and weak credit metrics based on the new S&P ratings. The report further stated that the ratings reflect Alcoa strong business position as one of the largest integrated aluminum producers in the world, with broad product, business, and geographic diversity and efficient alumina operations. On February 13, 2009, Moody Investors Service (Moody s) changed its long-term debt rating of Alcoa from Baa1 to Baa3 and its short-term debt rating from Prime-2 to Prime-3. Moody rating report stated that the changes in Alcoa ratings reflect the relatively weak debt protection measures, increased debt levels and leverage ratios, and negative cash flow position of Alcoa going into a major economic downturn. Moody removed all ratings from negative creditwatch and the current outlook was changed from negative to stable. The change in the outlook was based on Moody view that Alcoa will be able to materially reduce short-term debt outstanding due to the monetization of Alcoa investment in Shining Prospect, the anticipation that Alcoa will continue to focus on reducing cash consumption, and that liquidity will remain comfortably above requirements. On December 21, 2009, Moody changed their current outlook from stable to rating under review for both long-term and short-term debt of Alcoa. Moody review reflects Alcoa announcement that it signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new industrial complex in Saudi Arabia, comprised of a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter, and rolling mill, which will require the Company to spend approximately $900 over a four-year period. The potential for further delay in balance sheet improvement and debt reduction as a result of this investment, given Moody expectation for only slow recovery in the aluminum industry and in Alcoa earnings, was a consideration prompting this review. The review also results from the slower than anticipated (by Moody s) recovery in earnings generation through 2009 by Alcoa despite higher than anticipated aluminum prices together with the more moderate pace of improvement in debt protection metrics, debt reduction, and balance sheet strength. On February 13, 2009, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) changed its long-term debt rating of Alcoa from BBB to BBB- and its short-term debt rating from F2 to F3. Fitch rating report stated that the changes in Alcoa ratings reflect lower earnings coupled with higher than expected debt levels resulting in higher financial leverage. Fitch also changed the current outlook from stable to negative. The report further stated that the ratings reflect Alcoa leading position in the industry, its strength in low-cost alumina production, and the operating flexibility afforded by the scope of the Company operations. Investing Activities Cash used for investing activities was $721 in 2009 compared with $2,410 in 2008 and $1,625 in 2007. The use of cash in 2009 was mainly due to $1,622 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $59), 68% of which related to growth projects, including the S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, and Estreito hydroelectric power project; $181 in additions to investments, mostly for $83 in available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance program and an $80 interest in a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; and a net cash outflow of $65 for the divestiture of assets and businesses, including a cash outflow of $204 for the EES business, cash inflows of $111 for the collection of a note related to the 2007 sale of the Three Oaks mine and the sale of property in Vancouver, WA, and a cash inflow of $20 for the sale of the Shanghai (China) foil plant; all of which was partially offset by $1,031 from sales of investments, mostly related to the receipt of $1,021 for the sale of the Shining Prospect investment; and a net cash inflow of $112 from acquisitions, mainly due to $97 from the acquisition of a BHP Billiton subsidiary in the Republic of Suriname and $18 from the Elkem/Sapa AB exchange transaction. The use of cash in 2008 was principally due to $3,438 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $241), 58% of which related to growth projects, including the S o Lu 63 Table of Contents refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, Estreito hydroelectric power project, and flat-rolled products projects in Bohai (China) and Russia; $1,303 in additions to investments, mostly related to the $1,200 investment made in Shining Prospect Pte. Ltd. to acquire common stock of Rio Tinto plc; and $417 in acquisitions for the purchase of two aerospace fastener manufacturing businesses ($276), the buyout of outstanding noncontrolling interests in Bohai ($79) and Russia ($15), and a contingent payment made to Camargo Corr a Group related to the 2003 acquisition of 40.9% of Alcoa Alum nio S.A. ($47); all of which was partially offset by $2,710 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, mostly due to the $2,651 in net proceeds from the sale of the businesses within the former Packaging and Consumer segment. The use of cash in 2007 was primarily due to $3,636 in capital expenditures (includes costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities of $274), 64% of which related to growth projects, including the Iceland smelter, Mosj en anode facility in Norway, S o Lu refinery expansion, Juruti bauxite mine development, Estreito hydroelectric power project, and flat-rolled products projects in Bohai and Russia; and $131 in additions to investments, mostly due to various hydroelectric power projects in Brazil, a natural gas pipeline in Australia, and available-for-sale securities held by Alcoa captive insurance program; all of which was partially offset by $2,011 from sales of investments, mostly related to the $1,942 in proceeds received from the sale of the Chalco investment; and $183 in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses, principally due to cash received from the sales of a mine in Texas ($70) and the Automotive Castings business ($33). Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations. Alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, debt agreements, and lease agreements. Alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans, provide payments for postretirement benefit plans, and finance capital projects. As of December 31, 2009, a summary of Alcoa outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information): Total 2010 2011-2012 2013-2014 Thereafter Operating activities: Energy-related purchase obligations $ 18,674 $ 1,239 $ 2,283 $ 2,052 $ 13,100 Raw material purchase obligations 2,412 905 839 278 390 Other purchase obligations 364 61 130 131 42 Operating leases 1,027 224 397 180 226 Interest related to total debt 5,039 566 984 789 2,700 Estimated minimum required pension funding 2,530 100 1,280 1,150 - Postretirement benefit payments 2,705 285 580 560 1,280 Layoff and other restructuring payments 226 159 36 31 - Deferred revenue arrangements 140 8 16 16 100 Uncertain tax positions 64 - - - 64 Financing activities: Total debt 9,777 842 1,545 2,341 5,049 Dividends to shareholders - - - - - Investing activities: Capital projects 1,271 586 476 209 - Payments related to acquisitions - - - - - Totals $ 44,229 $ 4,975 $ 8,566 $ 7,737 $ 22,951 Obligations for Operating Activities Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 40 years. The majority of raw material and other purchase obligations have expiration 64 Table of Contents dates of 24 months or less. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain computer equipment, plant equipment, vehicles, and buildings. Interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2009 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2037. The effect of outstanding interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges, are included in interest related to total debt. As of December 31, 2009, these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on $1,890 of debt through 2018. As the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. Estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. The minimum required cash outlays for pension funding are estimated to be $100 for 2010 and $610 for 2011 (see Note Y to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K). The increase in the projected funding is the result of a reduction in available pension funding credits from 2010 to 2011. The funding estimate is $670 for 2012, $620 for 2013 and $530 for 2014. The expected pension contributions in 2010 and later reflect the impacts of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008. Pension contributions are expected to decline beginning in 2015 if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future. Postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate $300 annually, net of the estimated subsidy receipts related to Medicare Part D, and are reflected in the preceding table through 2019. Alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and postretirement benefit payments beyond 2014 and 2019, respectively. Layoff and other restructuring payments primarily relate to severance costs and are expected to be paid within one year. Amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to ongoing site remediation work, special termination benefit payments, and lease termination costs. Deferred revenue arrangements require Alcoa to deliver alumina over the specified contract period through 2027. While these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments, they represent contractual obligations for which the Company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made. Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. The amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of December 31, 2009. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary. Obligations for Financing Activities Total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt, including short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Maturities for long-term debt extend to 2037. Alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock. Including dividends on preferred stock, Alcoa paid $228 in dividends to shareholders during 2009. Because all dividends are subject to approval by Alcoa Board of Directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table until such authorization has occurred. As of December 31, 2009, there were 974,378,820 and 546,024 shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock, respectively. The annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of $3.75 per share. In March 2009, Alcoa decreased its annual common stock dividend from $0.68 per share to $0.12 per share, which began with the dividend paid on May 25, 2009, as part of a series of operational and financial actions taken to significantly improve Alcoa liquidity position. 65 Table of Contents Obligations for Investing Activities Capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2009. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is anticipated that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $1,000 in 2010. In December 2009, Alcoa signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new industrial complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, comprised of a bauxite mine, alumina refinery, aluminum smelter, and rolling mill, which will require the Company to spend approximately $900 over a four-year period (2010 through 2013). This amount is not reflected in the preceding table, as estimates of amounts per year are still being determined. Payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from Alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds. Amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur. In connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in Russia, Alcoa could be required to make additional contingent payments of approximately $85 through 2015, but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2009, Alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of $378. These guarantees expire in 2015 through 2027 and relate to project financing for hydroelectric power projects in Brazil. Alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to legal, customs duties, and leasing obligations, among others, which expire at various dates, that total $490 at December 31, 2009. Alcoa has outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $273 as of December 31, 2009. These letters of credit relate primarily to workers compensation, derivative contracts, and leasing obligations, and expire at various dates, mostly in 2010. Alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to customs duties, self-insurance, and legal obligations. The total amount committed under these bonds, which automatically renew or expire at various dates, mostly in 2010, was $140 at December 31, 2009. Alcoa has a program to sell a senior undivided interest in certain customer receivables, without recourse, on a continuous basis to a third-party for cash. This program was renewed on October 29, 2009 and expires on October 28, 2010. In August 2008, Alcoa increased the capacity of this program from $100 to $250. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, Alcoa derecognized $250 in Receivables from customers on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet under this program. Alcoa services the customer receivables for the third-party at market rates; therefore, no servicing asset or liability was recorded. Alcoa had an existing program with a different third-party to sell certain customer receivables. The sale of receivables under this program was conducted through a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE) that was bankruptcy remote, and, therefore, was not consolidated by Alcoa. Effective August 31, 2008, Alcoa terminated this program and all outstanding customer receivables were collected by the QSPE through the end of 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying Notes. Areas that require significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities; environmental and litigation matters; asset retirement obligations; the testing of goodwill, equity investments, and properties, plants, and equipment for impairment; estimating fair value of businesses to be divested; pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes. 66 Table of Contents Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments, estimates, and assumptions, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the Company Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A summary of the Company significant accounting policies is included in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about the Company operating results and financial condition. Derivatives and Hedging. Derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, Alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur, future gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in other income or expense. Alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing long-term debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges. As a result, the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to sales, cost of goods sold, or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge. These contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures, generally not exceeding five years. If no hedging relationship is designated, the derivative is marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions. Environmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery. Claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations. Litigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an 67 Table of Contents unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters, among others. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely, then, a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed periodically or sooner if significant changes in matters have occurred to determine if a change in the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a loss is necessary. Asset Retirement Obligations. Alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of Alcoa bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting facilities. These AROs consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal, closure of bauxite residue areas, mine reclamation, and landfill closure. Alcoa also recognizes AROs for any significant lease restoration obligation, if required by a lease agreement, and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities. The fair values of these AROs are recorded on a discounted basis, at the time the obligation is incurred, and accreted over time for the change in present value. Additionally, Alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life. Certain conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) related to alumina refineries, aluminum smelters, and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date. A CARO is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within Alcoa control. Such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures, maintenance and upgrade programs, and other factors. At the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made, Alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal, treatment, transportation, storage and (or) disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos, underground and aboveground storage tanks, polychlorinated biphenyls, various process residuals, solid wastes, electronic equipment waste, and various other materials. Such amounts may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are recorded. If Alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately, the estimated CARO as of December 31, 2009 ranges from less than $1 to $52 per structure (131 structures) in today dollars. Goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, or slower growth rates, among others. It is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Alcoa has nine reporting units (previously there were ten reporting units the EES business was sold in 2009), of which five are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment. The remaining four reporting units are the Alumina segment, the Primary Metals segment, the Flat-Rolled Products segment, and the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil, which is included in Corporate. Almost 90% of Alcoa total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows: Alcoa Fastening Systems (AFS) ($1,018) and Alcoa Power and Propulsion (APP) ($1,622) businesses, both of which are included in the Engineered Products and Solutions segment, and Primary Metals ($1,794). These amounts include an allocation of Corporate goodwill. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the current fair value of its 68 Table of Contents reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rate, and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The betas used in calculating the individual reporting units weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts. In 2009, the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, resulting in no impairment. The impairments tests yielded similar results between 2009 and 2008, including a smaller excess for Primary Metals than had been the case historically. In 2008, the excess of the estimated fair value of Primary Metals over its carrying value was substantially less than in prior years due to the unprecedented decline in the LME price that occurred in the second half of the year. Historically, LME pricing levels and corresponding input costs (e.g., raw materials, energy) have generally trended in the same manner, resulting in relatively consistent cash margins over time. However, the decline in the LME price significantly outpaced any decreases in associated input costs, causing expected cash margins in the early years in the DCF model to be lower than normal and lower than long-term expectations. In 2009, the LME price increased gradually throughout the year and exceeded $2,000 (in whole dollars) per metric ton by the end of the year, resulting in higher undiscounted expected future cash flows for Primary Metals, as the historical trend between LME pricing levels and input costs began to return. However, Primary Metals WACC, the measure used by Alcoa to discount expected future cash flows, increased from 8.4% in 2008 to 10.4% in 2009, effectively negating the positive impact the rising LME price had on expected future cash flows. As a result, Primary Metals fair value continued to exceed its carrying value even though the excess has not yet returned to levels prior to 2008. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, additional analysis would be required. The additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill, which may involve the use of valuation experts. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized, which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders equity. Equity investments. Alcoa invests in a number of privately-held companies, primarily through joint ventures and consortiums, which are accounted for on the equity method. The equity method is applied in situations where Alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired. The following items are examples of impairment indicators: significant, sustained declines in an investee revenue, earnings, and cash flow trends; adverse market conditions of the investee industry or geographic area; the investee ability to continue operations measured by several items, including liquidity; and other factors. Once an impairment indicator is identified, management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary, in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value. An impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations. Properties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets (asset group) to their carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets (asset group) exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets (asset group) over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a DCF model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group and the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows also require significant judgments. 69 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale. The fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a DCF model, valuations performed by third parties, earnings multiples, or indicative bids, when available. A number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques, including the forecasting of markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs and expenses, and multiple other factors. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made; however, the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits. Liabilities and expenses for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age, and mortality). The interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the interest rates available at year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. The impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 1/4 of 1% is approximately $340 and either a charge or credit of $16 to after-tax earnings in the following year. The long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated by considering expected returns on current asset allocations, which is supported by historical actual returns, and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of assets. A change in the assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact after-tax earnings by approximately $16 for 2010. In 2009, the expected long-term rate of return was reduced to 8.75% due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the global economic downturn. This was supported by the fact that for the first time in 20 years in 2008, the 10-year moving average of actual performance fell below 9%, even though the 20-year moving average continued to exceed 9%. In 2009, the 20-year moving average of actual performance fell below 9% for the first time in more than 15 years, but has continued to exceed 8.75%. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.75% in 2010. In 2009, a net charge of $182 ($102 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate, which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. In 2008, a net charge of $2,181 ($1,374 after-tax) was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of plan assets, which was somewhat offset by the decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation (as a result of a 20 basis-point increase in the discount rate) and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs. Additionally, in both 2009 and 2008, a charge of $8 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy. Stock-based Compensation. Alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, annual forfeiture rate, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time. As part of Alcoa stock-based compensation plan design, individuals who are retirement-eligible have a six-month requisite service period in the year of grant. Equity grants are issued in January each year. As a result, a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first and second quarters of each year for these retirement-eligible employees. Compensation expense recorded in 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $87 ($58 after-tax), $94 ($63 after-tax), and $97 ($63 after-tax), respectively. Of this amount, $21, $19, and $19 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirement-eligible employees. On December 31, 2005, Alcoa accelerated the vesting of 11 million unvested stock options granted to employees in 2004 and on January 13, 2005. The 2004 and 2005 accelerated options had weighted average exercise prices of $35.60 and $29.54, respectively, and in the aggregate represented approximately 12% of Alcoa total outstanding options. The decision to accelerate the vesting of the 2004 and 2005 options was made primarily to avoid recognizing the 70 Table of Contents related compensation expense in future earnings upon the adoption of a new accounting standard. The accelerated vesting of the 2004 and 2005 stock options reduced Alcoa after-tax stock option compensation expense in 2007 by $7. Plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options, stock awards, or a combination of both. This choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable. Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Alcoa assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized. Related Party Transactions Alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies, consisting of entities in which Alcoa retains a 50% or less equity interest, at negotiated arms-length prices between the two parties. These transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of Alcoa for all periods presented.
