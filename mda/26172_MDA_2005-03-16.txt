Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is management discussion of the financial results, liquidity and capital resources, contractual obligations and commercial commitments, financial covenants and credit ratings, off balance sheet arrangements, financial guarantees, critical accounting estimates and other key items related to our business and performance. This section should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in the Financial Statements section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain prior year amounts included in this section have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All references to per share amounts are diluted per share amounts. Our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS included in Part I of this report and Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements presented at the end of this section. OVERVIEW Cummins is a global power leader comprised of four reportable complementary business segments: Engine, Power Generation, Filtration and Other and International Distributors. Our businesses design, manufacture, distribute and service diesel and natural gas engines and related technologies, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, and filtration, emissions solutions and electrical power generation systems. Our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. Major OEM customers include DaimlerChrysler, PACCAR, International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar), Volvo, Komatsu, Ford, Volkswagen, CNH Global and our joint venture partners in China (Dongfeng Cummins Engine Co. Ltd.) and India (Tata Cummins Limited). We serve our customers through a network of more than 550 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,000 dealer locations in more than 160 countries and territories. Our business units share technology, customers, strategic partners, brands and our distribution network. Our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature and varying conditions of the markets we serve, particularly the automotive, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of crude oil (fuel costs), volume of freight tonnage, interest rate levels, non-residential construction spending and general industrial capital spending. Economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales volume and pricing of our products and reduce earnings and cash flow. Although cyclicality is a factor in our business, the financial impact of it has been reduced somewhat by our geographical expansion, growth in our distributor business and improvements in our fixed cost structure that have resulted in a lower break-even point of our production costs. 25 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW The table below sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Earnings data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 2002 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 80.1 82.2 82.1 Gross margin 19.9 17.8 17.9 Selling and administrative expenses 12.0 13.2 12.6 Research and engineering expenses 2.9 3.2 3.4 Equity, royalty and other income from investees (1.3 ) (1.1 ) (0.4 ) Restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) (0.1 ) Interest expense 1.3 1.4 1.0 Loss on early retirement of debt 0.1 Other income, net (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.2 ) Earnings before income taxes, minority interests, dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 5.1 1.4 1.3 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 0.7 0.2 (0.7 ) Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 0.3 0.2 0.3 Dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust 0.1 0.4 Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 4.1 0.9 1.3 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principles, net of tax (0.1 ) 0.1 Net earnings 4.1 0.8 1.4 Cummins experienced very strong performance in 2004 with record sales and earnings. Net earnings were $350 million, or $7.39 per share, on sales of $8.4 billion, compared to 2003 net earnings of $50 million, or $1.27 per share, on sales of $6.3 billion. The earnings improvement was driven by a 34 percent increase in net sales, primarily from our Engine Business and record sales at our Power Generation Business. Both segments experienced strong demand across respective automotive and industrial markets, with particularly strong demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market where engine sales were up 94 percent from the prior year and our market share increased significantly. Sales also increased in the Filtration and Other and International Distributor Businesses in 2004 compared to 2003 reflecting substantial improvement in demand and business conditions. Our joint ventures contributed $111 million in earnings in 2004 compared to $70 million in 2003, with the largest increase from our expanded joint venture in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company (DCEC). Overall, 2004 was an exceptionally strong financial year for Cummins and we believe the programs we have in place position us for another good year in 2005. BUSINESS OUTLOOK Our Engine Business experienced much stronger than expected volumes in virtually all of its markets in 2004 and most economic indicators point toward continued improvement at a moderate pace in the North American heavy-duty truck market in 2005. We currently expect North American heavy-duty truck production levels to increase a minimum of 15 percent, from an estimated 245,000 units in 2004 to approximately 280,000 to 285,000 units in 2005. While 2004 demand was driven partially from fleets adding capacity as freight volume increased, the majority of the increase resulted from the replacement of aging vehicles. In 2005, we expect demand will be driven primarily by the economy as manufacturing and consumer spending levels increase and trucking fleets expand their capacity by adding equipment. We also expect sales of our midrange engines to the medium-duty markets to increase in 2005, as economic indicators for this market historically correlate with those of the heavy-duty market. Currently, we estimate 26 our engine volumes for the worldwide medium-duty truck market to increase 20 percent in 2005, including an increase in market share. Sales of our 5.9 liter turbo diesel engine to Daimler Chrysler for the Dodge Ram truck reached record levels in 2004 and we expect 2005 volumes will increase with the scheduled availability of our engine in the new Dodge Ram Mega Cab. We expect the Dodge Ram Heavy-Duty Cummins Turbo will continue to result in strong sales volumes as demand for diesel-powered light vehicles increases. Our industrial markets also experienced a strong recovery in 2004 and continued growth is expected through 2005, particularly overall demand from construction and mining OEMs. Our Power Generation Business struggled financially in 2002 and 2003 as demand for global power generation declined, resulting in high inventory levels, over-capacity and market pricing pressures. In 2004, profitability returned to this segment based upon strong demand for commercial products in China and the Middle East, a significant increase in alternator sales to generator set OEMs, record sales of Onan branded generator sets to RV OEMs, our focus on cost reduction initiatives, benefits from restructuring and new product introductions. In 2005, we expect continued growth in commercial international markets for power generation and alternators and stronger growth in domestic markets. In our consumer business, we expect two new product launches, a portable generator set and a residential standby generator set, to offset a slight volume decline in RV generator sets. Overall, Power Generation revenues are expected to increase in 2005 with improved profitability for this segment. In our Filtration and Other Business, our long term agreements with key customers executed in 2003 and 2004 provided excellent revenue growth in 2004 although our financial results were impacted by the dramatic rise in steel prices and capacity constraints in our exhaust manufacturing. We expect revenue growth to continue in 2005 and we also expect some growth in aftermarket revenues from new products released in 2004. Revenue from our Emission Solutions business is expected to increase in 2005 as we continue to gain market share in the domestic retrofit business. Overall, Filtration and Other Business revenues are expected to increase approximately 7 percent in 2005, and profitability is expected to improve as a result of cost reduction initiatives and the impact of pricing actions to offset steel cost increases. In 2004, revenues improved in every geographic region and profitability was up significantly in our International Distributor Business. As the worldwide economy continues to improve and our engine population increases, we expect sales growth in engines, parts, service and power generation equipment and solid profit margins to continue in this business as we capitalize on a growing global customer base. We expect revenues to increase over 10 percent in 2005 from economic growth and increased profitability from higher sales volume, managed expenses and planned consolidations. Income from our joint ventures is expected to continue to be strong in 2005, particularly in Asia, through our partnership, DCEC, which is a supplier to the second largest truck manufacturer in China, and in North America through our distributorship joint ventures. We expect our businesses to generate sufficient cash from operations in 2005 to fund capital expenditures, research and development, pension funding, debt service costs and dividend payments. In addition, we expect cash outflows to fund our joint ventures will approximate $25 - $30 million in 2005. We have available various short and long-term credit arrangements, which are discussed below and disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . These credit arrangements and other programs, such as our accounts receivable program, provide the financial flexibility, when needed, to satisfy future short-term funding requirements of our debt service obligations and projected working capital requirements. On March 1, 2005, we repaid our $225 million 6.45% notes on their maturity date from cash and cash equivalents on hand. With the exception of payments required under various operating and capital leases, principal and interest payments on notes issued by a consolidated VIE and our pension funding commitments, there are no major fixed cash payment obligations occurring until 2010 when our 9.5% Notes with principal amount of $250 million mature. 27 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS, TRANSACTIONS AND FINANCIAL TRENDS Throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis we have disclosed significant events or transactions that had a material impact on our net earnings or segment EBIT, financial position and cash flows. In 2004, our net earnings benefited from significant tax events that likely will not recur with similar materiality or impact on our effective tax rate. Our 2004 tax expense was reduced by the following nonrecurring benefits: We reassessed the treatment of foreign tax credits previously recognized as tax deductions and used them as tax credits ($25 million), We amended prior years U.S. income tax returns and claimed additional export tax benefits ($11 million), We reversed valuation allowances related to state tax net operating losses that were no longer needed ($16 million), and We reduced our tax expense for a change in the estimated state income tax rate used to value deferred tax assets ($9 million). Other significant events and transactions that occurred during 2004 were: We adopted certain provisions of FIN 46R as of March 28, 2004, which required us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of three variable interest entities previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As of April 25, 2004, we consolidated another entity under the provisions of FIN 46R. After eliminating intercompany transactions, our assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2004, increased $319 million and $251 million, respectively, and our net sales, gross margin and net earnings increased $145 million, $60 million and $0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004 (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). Our gross margin and net earnings were negatively affected by the rising cost of steel and other commodities, primarily copper, manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies due to significant increases in production and supplier constraints to meet growing demand. Steel prices increased 50-60 percent during 2004 and it is likely they will remain high in the first half of 2005 although we expect increases to be less significant than those experienced in 2004. While our primary focus remains on controlling our costs through cost reduction efforts and Six Sigma projects, we have implemented pricing actions in our businesses to offset our current estimate of the impact of commodity prices in 2005. In addition, we have engaged in detailed capacity and throughput analysis work with many of our key suppliers to help them manage capacity constraint issues and have also developed a recovery plan to address our manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies. During 2004 we amended the master lease agreements related to two leases representing a majority of equipment leased in our PowerRent program. One of the lease amendments required us to retain full residual risk on the equipment and the other required us to repurchase the equipment at the end of the two-year non-cancelable lease terms. As a result, both leases are now classified as capital leases. The total addition to our Consolidated Balance Sheets as property, plant and equipment relating to the capital leases was $104 million and the balance of the capital lease obligations at December 31, 2004, was $103 million. (See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). $6 million pre-tax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in 2001 and 2002. 28 Significant transactions included in 2003 earnings were: $7 million pre-tax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in 2001 and 2002, and $4 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the consolidation of a variable interest entity. Significant transactions included in 2002 earnings were: $57 million tax adjustment credit related to the settlement of U.S. income tax audits for the years 1992 through 1999, $8 million credit for excess costs of restructuring actions, $8 million pre-tax charge related to early extinguishment of debt, $4 million pre-tax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in 2001 and 2002, and $3 million after-tax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to changing our pension measurement date. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Net sales of our business segments for the years ended December 31, follows: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions Engine $ 5,500 $ 3,631 $ 3,435 Power Generation 1,877 1,329 1,226 Filtration and Other 1,484 1,056 951 International Distributor 856 669 574 Elimination of intersegment sales (1,279 ) (389 ) (333 ) Total consolidated net sales $ 8,438 $ 6,296 $ 5,853 Sales of our Engine Business increased $1,869 million, or 51 percent (38 percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under Business Segment Results), compared to the prior year, primarily due to strong demand from heavy- and medium-duty truck OEMs, increased shipments to Chrysler of light-duty engines for the Dodge Ram truck and higher engine shipments to industrial OEMs. Engine and part sales to automotive markets were 42 percent higher than 2003 with increased shipments in all market segments, except bus applications. Power Generation sales increased $548 million, or 41 percent, (45 percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under Business Segment Results) compared to the prior year, buoyed by strong demand for generator sets and alternators in international markets and continued robust demand for RV and other consumer power generation products. Sales in the Filtration and Other Business were up $428 million, or 41 percent, (21 percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under Business Segment Results) compared to the prior year, with improvements in most markets, but primarily driven by North American OEMs. Sales in our International Distributor Business increased $187 million, or 28 percent, compared to 2003, with moderate growth in engine, parts and service and strong demand for power generation products. 29 Total sales in 2004 increased approximately $145 million from the consolidation of entities under FIN 46R (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). Sales increased in all of our business segments in 2003 compared to 2002, with a majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year as economic conditions strengthened and overall demand for our products improved. Engine Business sales increased $196 million, or 6 percent, primarily from higher engine sales to DaimlerChrysler for the Dodge Ram truck. Power Generation sales increased $103 million, or 8 percent, compared to the prior year, buoyed by strong fourth quarter demand. Sales in the Filtration and Other Business exceeded the $1 billion level, up $105 million, or 11 percent year-over-year, reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration. Sales in our International Distributor Business increased $95 million, or 17 percent, compared to 2002, primarily from strong sales of engines and parts at our distributorships in Australia, Dubai and South Africa. Gross Margin Our gross margin was $1,680 million in 2004 compared to $1,123 million in 2003, with related gross margin percentages of 19.9 and 17.8, respectively. The majority of the change in year-over-year gross margin was a result of the following: higher engine shipments, particularly to the North American automotive and industrial markets, higher sales across our other three businesses ($525 million), and related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs ($125 million), increased product coverage costs due to higher volumes ($69 million), higher material costs for copper and steel, net of price realization ($53 million), supplier inefficiencies resulting from higher volumes, including premium freight charges and overtime ($40 million), the impact of favorable currency exchange rates ($18 million), and one-time charge for inventory valuation ($9 million). Approximately 11 percent of the increase in 2004 gross margin was a result of consolidating entities under FIN 46R (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). Product coverage expense as a percent of net sales was 3.1 percent in 2004 compared to 3.0 percent in 2003. In the fourth quarter we revised our definition of product coverage expense to include only the cost of base engine warranty and exclude the costs of other marketing and extended warranty programs, the majority of which are purchased by customers. In our view, this definition is a more relevant and preferable measure than previously used and accordingly, we have presented base engine warranty expense as a percent of net sales for 2003 and 2002 on a comparable basis. Gross margin increased $78 million in 2003, compared to 2002, on a net sales increase of $443 million and the related gross margin percentages were relatively flat at 17.8 percent. The gross margin on our new emissions compliant engine models was essentially flat compared to the pre-emission engines as the higher price of the new engine models was offset by incremental costs of new parts and components and higher accrual for product coverage costs. The gross margin percentage in 2003, however, appears lower as the gross margin dollar amount was measured against a higher sales value due to the pricing action. Base 30 engine warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was essentially flat year-over-year at 3.0 percent in 2003 and 3.1 percent in 2002. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses were $1,015 million, or 12.0 percent of net sales in 2004 compared to $830 million, or 13.2 percent of net sales in 2003, or an increase of $185 million, or 22 percent, year-over-year. The increase was comprised of $107 million for selling expenses (including $25 million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates) and $78 million for administrative expenses (including $9 million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates). The year-over-year increase in selling expenses was a result of the following: higher compensation expense and fringe benefits from incremental staffing ($47 million), increases in marketing program expenses including travel and entertainment ($18 million) and other volume variable expenses that individually were not significant, and increased variable compensation from improved financial performance ($14 million). The increase in administrative expenses was attributable to the following: increased variable compensation from improved financial performance ($35 million), higher compensation and fringe benefits from incremental staffing ($15 million), and increased consulting expenses, primarily Sarbanes-Oxley implementation costs ($14 million). Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on 2004 selling and administrative expenses, primarily due to changes in the Pound Sterling ($16 million), Australian dollar ($7 million) and the Euro ($5 million). Approximately $34 million, or 18 percent, of the increase in selling and administrative expenses resulted from consolidating entities under FIN 46R (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). In 2003, selling and administrative expenses were $830 million (13.2 percent of net sales) compared to $736 million (12.6 percent of net sales) in 2002. Included in the increase was $28 million from the impact of foreign exchange rate changes at our foreign entities. Of the total increase, approximately $56 million was related to selling expenses and $38 million to administrative expenses. The increase in selling expense was attributable to the following: higher compensation expense from incremental sales staffing ($13 million), funding of growth initiatives including outside consulting services ($11 million), increases in fringe expenses including pensions ($9 million), increases in variable incentive compensation due to improved segment financial performance ($7 million), and other volume variable expenses that individually were not significant. The increase in administrative expenses resulted from the following: higher fringe benefit expenses, primarily pensions ($9 million), increases in audit and non-audit services ($9 million) resulting from a reaudit of the 2001 and 2000 Consolidated Financial Statements, increases in legal fees ($7 million), higher salaries and wages from staffing increases ($5 million), and and other miscellaneous items that individually are not significant. 31 Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses were $241 million (2.9 percent of net sales) in 2004 compared to $200 million (3.2 percent of net sales) in 2003, or an increase of $41 million or 21 percent. A majority of the increase was a result of the following: increased variable compensation from improved earnings ($13 million), higher spending on 2005 and 2007 product development programs ($11 million), increased compensation and fringe benefit expenses from incremental staffing ($9 million), and other general research and developmental expenses, none of which were individually significant. The increase includes $3 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates and $4 million from consolidating entities under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). Research and engineering expenses were $200 million (3.2 percent of net sales) in 2003 compared to $201 million (3.4 percent of net sales) in 2002, or a decrease of $1 million. Significant items comprising the year-over-year change follows: decreased salary and wages ($10 million), reduced spending on heavy-duty development program following the introductory launch of our new emissions compliant engines in 2002 ($14 million), decreased expenses related to development costs of our European Engine Alliance joint venture ($10 million), partially offset by increased development work and testing on Euro emissions and on Tier II and III industrial emissions engines ($20 million), increased fringe expenses, primarily pension expense ($5 million), and other expenses that individually were not material. Equity, Royalty and Other Income from Investees Earnings from our joint ventures and equity method investees were $111 million in 2004 compared to $70 million in 2003, an increase of $41 million, or 59 percent. The year-over-year increase was attributable to improved earnings across most of our joint ventures, including the following: our expanded joint venture in China, DCEC ($20 million), our North American distributor joint ventures ($9 million), our joint venture in India, Tata Cummins Ltd ($2 million), and Cummins MerCruiser, our marine joint venture ($2 million). Income from royalties and technical fees, which included a one-time $2 million fee from a China joint venture, was $12 million in 2004 compared to $5 million in 2003. Earnings from our joint ventures and alliances were $70 million in 2003 compared to $22 million in 2002, an increase of $48 million. The year-over-year increase was attributable to improved earnings at most of our joint ventures including the following: DCEC ($20 million), North American distributor joint ventures ($9 million), The European Engine Alliance ($5 million), 32 Chongqing Cummins Engine Company Ltd. ($4 million), Tata Holset and Tata Cummins Ltd. ($4 million), and Cummins MerCruiser ($3 million). Royalty income from joint ventures and alliances increased $3 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) Through the end of 2002, we continued a restructuring program initiated in 1998 to improve our cost structure. The charges related to this program included staffing reductions and reorganizations in various business segments, asset impairment write-downs for manufacturing equipment, facility closure and consolidation costs, dissolution costs and restructuring actions related to joint venture operations, cancellation of a new engine development program and exit costs related to several small business operations. Our 2002 results included a net $8 million credit related to restructuring programs comprised of a net $2 million charge in the second quarter and a $10 million reversal of excess accruals in the fourth quarter. The second quarter charge included $16 million for restructuring actions recognized in the quarter, offset by a $14 million reversal of excess accruals. The excess accruals resulted from realigning or canceling restructuring actions taken in 2001 and 2000. The $16 million second quarter charge included the following: $11 million attributable to workforce reductions, $3 million for asset impairment, and $2 million related to facility closures and consolidations. The workforce reduction included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately 220 salaried and 350 hourly employees and was based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations. The overall workforce reductions were a result of closing operations and moving production to available capacity. The asset impairment charge related to equipment available for disposal. The carrying value of the equipment and the effect of suspending depreciation on the equipment were not significant. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the number and mix of employees terminated under this program differed from our original estimate and we reversed approximately $1 million of excess accruals for severance costs and benefits. Approximately 210 salaried and 350 hourly employees were terminated under this plan. Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a schedule that presents by major cost component, activities related to the 2002 restructuring action, including adjustments to the original charges. All restructuring actions were completed as of December 31, 2003. Interest Expense Interest expense was $113 million in 2004, an increase of $23 million compared to $90 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to the following: the consolidation of entities under the provisions of FIN 46R ($12 million), and interest related to certain capital leases for power generation equipment ($2 million). 33 In addition to the above, the adoption of SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity required prospective classification of dividends on our preferred securities as interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings effective July 1, 2003. Including dividends on our preferred securities, interest expense increased $11 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The preferred securities are no longer reported as an obligation in our Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the adoption of FIN 46R (see Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), rather, the convertible subordinated debentures issued by us and representing the sole assets of the trust issuing the securities, are now classified as long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest expense was $90 million in 2003 compared to $61 million in 2002. Most of the increase resulted from the following: higher debt levels ($15 million), higher borrowing rates ($7 million) on our 9.5% Senior Notes issued in November 2002, and required presentation of dividends on our preferred securities as interest expense ($11 million) effective July 1, 2003, in accordance with a new accounting standard (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). The amount of interest paid in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $113 million, $90 million and $52 million, respectively. Other Income, net Other income, net was $10 million, $18 million and $9 million income in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively and includes losses on asset sales, impairment losses, foreign currency exchange, interest income, royalty income and other miscellaneous income and expense items. Other income decreased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to losses on the sale of fixed assets and investment write-downs, partially offset by higher royalties from increased sales volumes and higher technology income from joint venture partners. The major components of other income and expense, segregated between operating items and non-operating items, are disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Our income tax provision was $56 million in 2004, compared to a $12 million provision in 2003 and a $38 million income tax benefit in 2002. The higher 2004 tax provision reflects the increase in profit before taxes. Our effective tax rate is normally below the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35 percent, primarily because of research tax credits and reduced taxes on export earnings. Our 2004 effective tax rate of 13 percent is unusually low not only because of the normal favorable effects of research credits and export tax benefits, but also because of the following nonrecurring benefits: As a result of continued earnings improvement and improved economic outlook, we reassessed the treatment of 2002 and 2003 foreign tax credits previously recognized as tax deductions and determined they could be used as full tax credits. The more favorable treatment of these credits reduced our 2004 income tax provision by $25 million. As a result of improved cash flow during 2004, we filed amended U.S. income tax returns to claim additional export tax benefits related to prior years which we had previously forgone to avoid the associated tax payments required on the non-exempt export income of our foreign sales corporation. These additional export tax benefits related to prior years reduced our 2004 income tax provision by $11 million. 34 The 2004 earnings improvement also caused us to reassess our ability to realize state tax benefits from net operating losses generated in prior years. Previously, we had provided a valuation allowance to reduce the recorded tax value of these loss carryforwards to a lower estimated realizable value. Our reassessment determined that $16 million of this allowance was no longer needed and was recorded as a reduction of our 2004 income tax expense. In conjunction with our reassessment of the realizable value of state tax benefits, we also recognized a change in the estimated average state income tax rate used to value our deferred tax assets. This rate change reduced our 2004 income tax expense by $9 million. Excluding the unusual or nonrecurring benefits described above, our 2004 effective tax rate was 27 percent. This rate was lower than the 35 percent U.S. tax rate, primarily because of export tax benefits and research tax credits generated by 2004 operations. We expect our 2005 effective tax rate to be higher than this, but still well below 35 percent. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 phases out the export tax benefits (reduced 20 percent for 2005) that have been a key factor in our low tax rate. However, those benefits are replaced with a new U.S. manufacturer tax deduction which phases in beginning in 2005. The Jobs Act also includes a special one-year 85 percent deduction for qualifying dividends repatriated from foreign operations. Generally, the special 2005 repatriation rules are only beneficial on very low-taxed foreign earnings. We are reviewing the possible application of the rules to some foreign joint venture repatriations that could potentially reduce our 2005 income tax provision by $5 million to $10 million. The 2002 income tax benefit included a one-time, $57 million favorable tax adjustment credit related to the settlement of U.S. Internal Revenue Service income tax audits for tax years 1994 through 1999. The amount of income taxes paid in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $87 million, $50 million and $30 million, respectively. Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a complete disclosure of our income taxes including a reconciliation of the income tax provision (benefit) that would be expected using the 35 percent U.S. Federal income tax rate to the actual income tax provision (benefit) recorded. Minority Interests in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interests in our consolidated operations were $26 million in 2004, compared to $14 million in 2003 and $16 million in 2002. Approximately one-half of the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted from higher earnings at Wuxi Holset Ltd ($3 million), a 55 percent owned subsidiary, and Cummins India Limited ($4 million), a 51 percent owned-subsidiary. The remainder of the increase in minority interests is attributable to consolidating the results of four entities under the provisions of FIN 46R (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). The decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 is a result of lower earnings at Wuxi Holset and Cummins India Limited, partially offset by income from our 60 percent-owned subsidiary in Brazil, Cummins Powerent Comericio e Loca o, Ltda. Dividends on Preferred Securities Dividends on our preferred securities were $11 million in 2003 and $21 million in 2002. Effective July 1, 2003, these dividends were prospectively classified as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in accordance with SFAS 150. A description of our obligation relating to these preferred securities is provided in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principles Consolidation of a Variable Interest Entity 2003 In 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement whereby we sold and leased back heavy-duty engine manufacturing equipment from a grantor trust wholly-owned by a financial institution. In December 2003, the grantor trust, which acts as a lessor in the sale-leaseback transaction, was consolidated 35 when we adopted FIN 46R. Under FIN 46R, the lessor trust was deemed a variable interest entity (VIE) and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of the trust by virtue of our guaranteeing the leased equipment residual value. Accordingly, we recorded the cumulative effect of consolidating the VIE in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a change in accounting principle as of December 31, 2003, with the following impact: reduced earnings $6 million ($4 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share) which represents the reversal of the original sale-leaseback transaction (as if it had not occurred), and the consolidation of the VIE from the inception of the lease, and increased property, plant and equipment by a net $92 million (current carrying value as if it had been depreciated since the beginning of the lease) and increased long-term debt, other liabilities and minority interests by a net $98 million. Our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2004 also included interest expense on the lessor debt of $7 million and depreciation expense on the equipment of $11 million rather than rent expense. The effect of consolidating this VIE in 2004 reduced our pre-tax earnings by approximately $5 million which represents the difference between the sum of interest and depreciation expense recorded in 2004 and rent expense that would have been recorded prior to consolidation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the change in accounting and Note 18 for a description of the original leasing transaction. The consolidation of the VIE did not impact 2003 Consolidated Statements of Earnings, other than the cumulative effect at December 31, 2003, nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. Change in Pension Measurement Date 2002 During the fourth quarter of 2002, we changed the measurement date for measuring the return on assets invested in our pension plans and the minimum liability for pension plan obligations from September 30 to November 30. This change in measurement date aligns more closely with our fiscal year-end , and we believe provides a more current measurement of plan obligations and investment return on plan assets than previously presented. In accordance with GAAP, we have reported this change in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative after-tax effect of the change increased 2002 earnings $3 million, or $0.07 per share, and was recorded as of January 1, 2002. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of this accounting change. BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS We have four reportable business segments: Engine, Power Generation, Filtration and Other and International Distributors. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets served by each segment and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. We evaluate the performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest, taxes, minority interests, and cumulative effect of accounting changes (Segment EBIT) and return on average net assets (excluding debt, taxes and adjustments to the minimum pension liability). Prior to January 1, 2004, intersegment transfers between the Engine segment and the Power Generation segment and between the Filtration and Other segment and the Engine segment were recorded at cost and a sale was not recorded by the transferor segment. Effective January 1, 2004, all intersegment sales of the transferor segments were recorded at a market-based transfer price discounted for certain items. Unit shipments are now also reflected in the sales volumes of the transferor segments. Certain intersegment cost allocations to the transferor segments have also been eliminated. In addition, certain engines manufactured by the Engine segment and sold to International Distributors through Power Generation were previously recorded as a sale by Power Generation; however, under the new methodology Power Generation now records a sale commission on such sales. We believe this change allows our 36 segment management to focus on those pricing decisions and cost structuring actions within their control. The impact of this change in methodology to 2004 segment results follows: Engine Business sales increased $502 million, Filtration and Other Business sales increased $205 million, Power Generation sales decreased $44 million, and Intersegment sales eliminations increased $663 million. The net impact of this change did not have a material effect on segment EBIT for any of our segments. Segment results for 2003 and 2002 were not restated to reflect the change to market-based transfer pricing as it was impracticable to do so. Engine The net sales and segment EBIT for the Engine Business for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions Net sales $ 5,500 $ 3,631 $ 3,435 Segment EBIT $ 341 $ 70 $ 49 Net sales for this business increased $1,869 million, or 51 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to the economic recovery evidenced by strong demand across all market sectors, particularly the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty truck markets and the light-duty automotive market with record engine sales to DaimlerChrysler for the Dodge Ram truck. Total automotive-related engine sales were 67 percent of Engine Business sales in 2004 compared to 71 percent in 2003. Net sales for this business increased $196 million, or 6 percent in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to strong sales of ISB engines to DaimlerChrysler for the Dodge Ram truck. Segment EBIT increased $271 million in 2004, to almost five times segment EBIT in 2003. The year-over-year improvement was primarily a net result of the following: Improved gross margin resulting from higher engine volumes and service part sales and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants along with the consolidation of heavy-duty test and assembly operations ($458 million), increased selling and administrative expenses ($96 million) and research and engineering expenses ($29 million), higher product coverage expense from increased sales volumes ($59 million), steel surcharges ($28 million) from higher steel prices, and premium freight costs ($17 million). In addition, income from joint ventures increased $34 million compared to 2003, primarily from higher volumes and earnings at our China joint venture, DCEC, and earnings from our North American distributorships. 37 In 2003, segment EBIT increased $21 million, or 43 percent, compared to 2002. The year-over-year improvement in earnings was primarily a net result of the following: higher earnings from joint ventures and alliances ($41 million) resulting from higher sales volumes from DCEC and North American distributors, increased selling and administrative expenses ($38 million) resulting from higher pension cost and higher variable compensation as a consequence of earnings improvement, higher engine volumes and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants and our consolidation of heavy-duty test and assembly operations ($20 million), and reduced spending for research and development following the launch of our 2002 emissions-compliant engines ($7 million). A summary and discussion of Engine Business net sales by market for the years ended December 31, follows: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions Heavy-Duty Truck $ 1,741 $ 1,100 $ 1,069 Medium-Duty Truck and Bus 773 560 599 Light-Duty Automotive 1,176 935 781 Total Automotive 3,690 2,595 2,449 Industrial 1,288 1,036 986 Stationary Power 522 n/a n/a Total net sales $ 5,500 $ 3,631 $ 3,435 Unit shipments increased 98,600 units, or 31 percent, in 2004 compared to unit shipments a year earlier. Unit shipments in 2003 increased 9,600 units, or 3 percent, compared to 2002 shipments. A summary of unit shipments by engine category for the three years ended December 31, follows: 2004 2003 2002 Midrange 331,200 266,800 251,100 Heavy-Duty 80,500 47,400 53,600 High-Horsepower 4,700 3,600 3,500 Total unit shipments 416,400 317,800 308,200 Heavy-Duty Truck Sales to the heavy-duty truck market increased significantly in 2004, up $641 million, or 58 percent, compared to 2003. The increase resulted from strong demand in the North American truck industry driven primarily by economic growth and related increase in freight tonnage and higher replacement demand for trucks. Unit shipments of heavy-duty truck engines were up 84 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 with North American shipments up 97 percent and international shipments up 26 percent. In 2003, sales to the heavy-duty truck market increased $31 million, or 3 percent, compared to 2002 sales. The increase was primarily attributable to a modest recovery in the North American truck industry evidenced by strong demand at the end of the year as fourth quarter sales increased 15 percent compared to the previous quarter. Unit shipments of heavy-duty truck engines declined 14 percent in 2003 compared 2002. The decline was a result of significant pre-buy activity prior to the North American October 1, 2002, EPA emissions standards. The volume decline in 2003 unit shipments was more than offset by higher unit pricing for our new ISX and ISM emissions compliant engines and higher part sales. 38 Medium-Duty Truck and Bus Medium-duty truck and bus revenues increased $213 million, or 38 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003. Shipments of medium-duty truck engines were up 93 percent to North American OEMs and up 36 percent to international OEMs compared to 2003. The increase in medium-duty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavy-duty market. Worldwide shipments of bus engines were down 10 percent in 2004 compared to 2003. Most of the decline occurred in international markets with some demand recovery in China where volumes were up compared to 2003. However, lower sales to India and Europe/CIS more than offset the increase. In 2003, medium-duty truck and bus revenues declined $39 million, or 7 percent, compared to 2002. The majority of the decrease resulted from declining bus engine sales as engine sales for medium-duty trucks were essentially flat compared to 2002. Worldwide bus engine sales declined 37 percent in 2003 and unit shipments were down 39 percent, primarily in North America, due to declining market share from a major bus OEM and also lower engine sales to China where sales were replaced by sales from one of our joint ventures in China. Light-Duty Automotive Sales of light-duty automotive engines increased $241 million, or 26 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003. Total unit shipments were 178,000 in 2004, an increase of 18 percent compared to 2003. Most of the increase in light-duty automotive sales was driven by strong demand from DaimlerChrysler for Dodge Ram truck engines with record shipments of 154,300 units, or a 20 percent increase compared to 2003. Engine shipments to recreational vehicle OEMs decreased slightly, down 3 percent in 2004 compared to 2003, partially as a result of higher shipments in 2003 in advance of new product introductions and slightly lower market share in 2004. In 2003, sales from our light-duty automotive engines increased $154 million, or 20 percent, compared to 2002. Total unit shipments in 2003 were 150,300, an increase of 21 percent compared to the prior year. Engine shipments to DaimlerChrysler for the Dodge Ram truck set a record in 2003, increasing 28 percent, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased demand and market share improvement. Unit shipments of medium-duty engines to the recreational vehicle market declined 13 percent year-over-year, reflecting a pre-buy of engine models in 2002 prior to the new emissions standards. Industrial Total industrial sales to the construction, agricultural, mining, marine, government, oil and gas and rail markets increased $252 million, or 24 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003. Unit shipments increased 26 percent year-over-year reflecting a slight change in sales mix to lower-priced engines. Approximately 42 percent of the shipments were to North American markets and 58 percent to international markets compared to 39 percent and 61 percent, respectively, in 2003. Overall growth in industrial markets was driven by strong demand in 2004 as the capital goods sector of the economy experienced a significant recovery. The year-over-year increase in sales resulted primarily from the following: Engine sales to the construction market increased 25 percent year-over-year with shipments to North American OEMs up 41 percent and shipments to international OEMs up 20 percent, Engine sales to agricultural equipment OEMs increased 18 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 with a 15 percent increase in North American shipments and a 1 percent increase in shipments to international OEMs, Engine sales to the mining equipment market, comprised mostly of high-horsepower engines, were up 56 percent in 2004, driven primarily by higher coal and metal prices. Engine shipments to mining OEMs in North America increased 59 percent and were up 44 percent to international OEMs, 39 Engine sales to the commercial marine market increased 24 percent year-over-year while shipments increased 9 percent evidencing a higher mix of sales to higher priced engines, Engine sales to government markets, primarily for military use, were relatively flat year-over-year, Engine shipments to the OEMs in the oil and gas market were up significantly in 2004 compared to a low base in 2003 as our QSK engine continues to be well received in this relatively new market, and, Engine sales to rail equipment OEMs, primarily railcar builders in international locations, increased 64 percent in 2004 compared to 2003, indicating strong demand for this market segment. In 2003, total industrial sales increased $50 million, or 5 percent compared to 2002, while shipments were down 2 percent year-over-year, reflecting a change in sales mix to higher-priced engines. The year-over-year increase was attributable to the following: Sales to construction equipment OEMs increased 9 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 with shipments to North American OEMs down 10 percent and shipments to international OEMs up 9 percent, Total 2003 engine shipments to the agricultural equipment market increased 9 percent compared to 2002 with a 32 percent increase to international OEMs due to strong demand in Latin America, Engine shipments to mining equipment OEMs, primarily K and Q series high-horsepower engines, were down 6 percent to OEMs in North America but were more than offset by a 44 percent increase from international OEMs, primarily due to market share gain, Engine shipments to the marine market declined 20 percent in 2003 compared to 2002, partially as a result of our new joint venture with Brunswick Corporation, Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine LLC, which records sales of our midrange and heavy-duty engines for recreational marine applications, Engine sales to government markets increased 59 percent in 2003, Engine shipments to the recently entered oil and gas equipment market were up significantly in 2003, primarily from market share gains in North America, and Shipments of engines to railcar builders declined 30 percent in 2003, as a result of weak demand. Stationary Power Engine Business sales to stationary power markets were $522 million in 2004. This new sales category arose from a change in 2004 where all intersegment engine sales from the Engine Business to the Power Generation Business are recorded at a market-based transfer price. Prior to 2004, intersegment transfers were recorded at cost and a sale was not recorded by the Engine Business. Segment financial results for 2003 and 2002 were not restated to reflect this change as it was impracticable to do so. Power Generation The net sales and segment EBIT for Power Generation for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions Net sales $ 1,877 $ 1,329 $ 1,226 Segment EBIT $ 69 $ (15 ) $ (25 ) 40 Net sales for this business increased $548 million, or 41 percent, compared to 2003 (excludes $44 million attributable to the change in intersegment transfer pricing). A majority of the sales increase was driven by improved economic conditions in the commercial, consumer and alternator product markets as follows: Unit shipments of commercial generator drives (g-drives) and generator sets (gen sets), alternators, and gen sets for the consumer and mobile/RV markets increased significantly in 2004 as a result of strong demand, Year-over-year gen set sales increased 38 percent, G-drive sales were up 47 percent, Revenues from alternators increased 110 percent, and Sales in the consumer mobile/RV market increased 20 percent. Approximately $90 million of the sales increase resulted from the consolidation of new entities, including those consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46R. Net sales in our Power Generation Business increased $103 million, or 8 percent, in 2003 compared to 2002. A majority of the sales increase occurred in the second half of the year, as general economic conditions improved and demand for commercial power equipment began to recover. Overall, sales of generator drives increased 22 percent, alternator sales increased 24 percent, sales of small generator sets to the consumer mobile/RV market increased 8 percent and sales of commercial generator sets were flat year-over-year. A summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category for the years ended December 31, follows: 2004 2003 2002 Midrange 16,800 14,000 14,000 Heavy-duty 6,700 5,300 4,300 High-horsepower 7,400 5,200 5,400 Total unit shipments 30,900 24,500 23,700 Total Power Generation shipments increased 6,400 units, or 26 percent, compared to 2003. Unit shipments of power generation equipment with midrange engines increased 20 percent: g-drive midrange powered units increased 8 percent in 2004 compared to 2003, and midrange powered g-sets increased 35 percent with strong demand in East Asia. Unit shipments of power generation equipment with heavy-duty engines increased 1,400 units, or 26 percent compared to 2003: g-drive heavy-duty powered units increased 27 percent, and heavy-duty powered g-sets increased 31 percent with strong demand in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Unit shipments of power generation equipment with high-horsepower engines that typically have higher sales values, increased 2,200 units, or 42 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003: high-horsepower g-drive units increased 36 percent, and high-horsepower g-sets increased 53 percent year-over-year, primarily due to strong demand in Middle East, India and China. 41 Total unit sales for Power Generation increased 800 units, or 3 percent, in 2003 compared to 2002. Unit shipments of power generation equipment with midrange engines were unchanged compared to 2002. Unit shipments of power generation equipment with heavy-duty engines increased 1,000 units, or 23 percent compared to 2002: g-drive units increased 23 percent, and g-sets increased 17 percent. Unit shipments of power generation equipment with high-horsepower engines decreased 200 units, or 4 percent compared to 2002: high-horsepower g-drive units increased 5 percent, and high-horsepower g-sets decreased 15 percent year-over-year. The overall increase in 2003 unit sales of g-drive and gen sets was attributable to improvement in commercial markets during the second half of the year. Sales of power generation equipment in North America was flat in 2003 compared to 2002 with sales to international locations up 11 percent, primarily in India, South Pacific, Brazil, Mexico and Europe. Alternator sales increased 24 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 while sales of small generator sets for the consumer mobile/RV market increased 8 percent, reflecting strong demand in this segment and market penetration in the consumer-towable RV market. In 2004, Power Generation segment EBIT was $69 million, compared to a $15 million loss before interest and taxes in 2003, or a year-over-year improvement of $84 million. The improvement was largely attributable to the strong commercial sales volumes across all geographic markets driven by an improving economy and increased capital goods spending. The increase in segment EBIT was attributable to the following: higher volumes and related absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses ($81 million), cost reduction actions ($29 million), price realization ($16 million), higher earnings at joint ventures ($6 million), partially offset by increased costs of steel and copper ($14 million), unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates ($10 million), and higher selling, administrative and research and engineering expenses ($35 million). In 2003, Power Generation incurred a loss before interest and taxes of $15 million, compared to a $25 million loss before interest and taxes in 2002, an improvement of $10 million year-over-year. The improvement was primarily attributable to the following: increase in gross margin on higher sales during the second half of the year ($16 million), improved earnings at joint ventures ($4 million), partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses ($17 million), and other items that individually were not significant. The sales increase was a result of modest demand improvement, primarily in the second half of the year, as overall economic conditions began to improve. 42 Filtration and Other Business The net sales and segment EBIT for Filtration and Other for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions Net sales $ 1,484 $ 1,056 $ 951 Segment EBIT $ 84 $ 86 $ 94 This business achieved record sales in 2004 reflecting demand improvement from OEMs and increased market share. Sales increased $428 million, or 41 percent in 2004, compared to 2003 (includes $205 million due to the change in intersegment transfer pricing). A majority of the increase was volume related and reflected strong OEM and aftermarket sales demand as follows: sales of filtration and exhaust products in the U.S. increased 16 percent compared to 2003, sales to international locations increased 14 percent, most notably in Europe, Asia, and Australia, partially offset by sales declines in Canada, and sales of our Holset subsidiary, which manufacturers turbochargers, increased 45 percent in 2004, compared to 2003, (excluding the impact of intersegment transfers), with higher aftermarket sales to OEMs, and strong demand from our joint ventures in China. Net sales increased $105 million, or 11 percent, in 2003 compared to 2002. Domestic sales of filtration products increased 12 percent and international sales also increased 12 percent, most notably in Europe, Asia, Australia and South Africa, partially offset by sales declines in Canada and Mexico. The increase in sales was primarily volume related and reflected higher OEM demand and increased aftermarket sales of filtration products. Sales of Holset turbochargers increased 22 percent in 2003, compared to 2002, with strong demand from OEMs, aftermarket sales and sales to joint ventures partially offset by lower sales to our China joint ventures. Segment EBIT in 2004 was $84 million, slightly below segment EBIT in 2003. While higher filtration sales and increased volumes at Holset contributed an incremental $40 million to gross margin year-over-year, gross margin percentage declined in 2004 compared to 2003. The lower gross margin percentage resulted from the following: higher steel prices used in manufacturing filters and exhaust products ($17 million, net of $7 million price recovery), and production inefficiencies from capacity constraints ($21 million). In addition, higher selling, and administrative expenses ($30 million), and increases in research and engineering expenses ($16 million) reduced segment EBIT in 2004, compared to 2003, and were partially offset by higher earnings at joint ventures ($2 million) and other income ($2 million). Segment EBIT declined $8 million, or 9 percent, compared to 2002. Earnings were lower in 2003 primarily from: higher selling and administrative expenses ($19 million) from funding growth initiatives, increased logistics and higher employee benefit costs, including pensions, increases in research and engineering expenses ($5 million), offset by volume driven improvement in gross margin ($13 million), and improved earnings at joint ventures ($2 million). 43 International Distributor Business The net sales and segment EBIT for International Distributor for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions Net sales $ 856 $ 669 $ 574 Segment EBIT $ 51 $ 40 $ 29 Our International Distributor Business recorded record sales in 2004, up $187 million, or 28 percent, compared to 2003. Approximately one-half of the total sales increase was attributable to parts and service revenue, up 21 percent, with increases at almost all distributor locations and significant increases at distributorships in Dubai, Australia, China and South Africa. Engine sales, representing 22 percent of the total sales increase, were up 37 percent compared to the prior year with strong demand across most locations and significantly higher engine sales at distributorships in Europe/CIS, Singapore, India and Dubai. Sales of power generation equipment accounted for 26 percent of the total sales increase in 2004 and were up 58 percent with strong demand at distributorships in Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. Approximately $46 million of the sales increase was attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Sales increased $95 million, or 17 percent in 2003, compared to 2002. Engine sales were relatively flat year-over-year, while part sales increased 31 percent in 2003 and sales of power generation equipment increased 50 percent, primarily at our Dubai distributor. Sales increased at all distributor locations with the exception of Hong Kong and Zimbabwe, with significant increases in Australia, India, South Africa, Dubai and Europe, primarily the U.K. and Ireland. Segment EBIT increased $11 million in 2004, or 28 percent, compared to 2003. The increased earnings resulted from the following: higher gross margin driven by higher sales of engines, parts and service and power generation equipment ($28 million), partially offset by higher volume variable selling expenses ($19 million), and other miscellaneous items that individually were not significant. Gross margin was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates ($10 million) but the impact was offset by the unfavorable effects of exchange rates on selling and administrative expenses. In 2003, segment EBIT increased $11 million, or 38 percent, compared to 2002. The increase in earnings was attributable to improved gross margin from higher sales volumes ($24 million), partially offset by increases in volume variable expenditures, primarily selling and administrative expenses ($19 million). Geographic Markets Sales to international markets were 48 percent of total net sales in 2004, compared to 47 percent of total net sales in 2003 and 45 percent of total net sales in 2002. 44 A summary of net sales by geographic territory for the years ended December 31, follows: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions United States $ 4,363 $ 3,356 $ 3,202 Asia/Australia 1,474 1,112 1,023 Europe/CIS 1,145 827 763 Mexico/Latin America 567 475 423 Canada 549 292 283 Africa/Middle East 340 234 159 Total international 4,075 2,940 2,651 Total consolidated net sales $ 8,438 $ 6,296 $ 5,853 Shipments of heavy-duty automotive engines to international markets in 2004 were up 26 percent compared to 2003, primarily due to strong demand in Mexico and Asia. Shipments of midrange automotive engines to international markets increased 36 percent in 2004 compared to 14 percent growth in 2003 due to increased shipments to Latin American OEMs. Shipments of light-duty automotive engines to international markets increased 20 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 while shipments of bus engines to international locations decreased 14 percent due to lower shipments to India, Europe/CIS and East Asia. Industrial engine shipments to international markets were up 19 percent in 2004, compared to 2003, with strong demand from construction and mining equipment OEMs in Asia, Latin America and Europe/CIS. The increase in international sales was primarily a result of the following: Sales to the Asia/Australia region increased $362 million, or 33 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily from increased demand from construction equipment OEMs in Asia and strong demand for power generation equipment in Southeast Asia, Australia and India, Sales to Europe/CIS, representing 28 percent of international sales and 14 percent of total sales in 2004, increased 38 percent compared to the prior year, mostly due to increased engine shipments to European OEMs and strong demand for filtration products, Sales to Mexico/Latin America, representing 14 percent of international sales, increased $92 million, or 19 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily from higher engine sales to automotive, agricultural and construction equipment OEMs in South America, Sales to Canada, representing 13 percent of international sales and 7 percent of total sales in 2004, increased 88 percent compared to 2003, driven by higher heavy-duty and midrange automotive sales, and Sales to Africa/Middle East increased $106 million, or 45 percent, in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily driven by increased sales of engines and parts and power generation equipment at our Dubai and South Africa distributors. Net sales to international markets increased $289 million, or 11 percent in 2003, compared to 2002. Sales increased in all geographic regions in 2003, primarily on the strength of increased demand for engines and generator drive units at our Australian distributorship, increased medium duty engines sales to UK OEMs, higher engine sales to agricultural OEMs, higher power generation sales to Mexico/Latin America and higher sales of engines and parts at our distributors in Dubai and South Africa. 45 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Capital Structure Cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of funding our working capital requirements. At certain times, cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and as a result, we use periodic borrowings, primarily our accounts receivable sales program and our revolving credit facility, to fund our working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2004, there were no amounts outstanding under our receivable sales program or our revolving credit facility. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we entered into a receivable securitization program that provided a cost-effective method to fund our trade accounts receivable. This program diversified our funding base and provided a flexible source of funding that was not reported on our balance sheet. In December 2003, this program expired and there were no amounts outstanding under the program at that time. In January 2004, we entered into a similar type of program with a different financial institution. A more complete description of this program, which discloses certain cash flows related to the program, is found below under the caption, Off Balance Sheet Financing Sale of Accounts Receivable and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We also have various short and long-term credit arrangements available, which are also discussed below and disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We believe cash generated from operations, our credit facility arrangements and our accounts receivable program provide us with the financial flexibility required to satisfy future short-term funding requirements for working capital, debt service obligations, capital spending and projected pension funding. On March 1, 2005 we repaid our 6.45% Notes with principal amount of $225 million from cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2004, we believe our liquidity is adequate with cash and cash equivalents of $611 million, $530 million available under our new revolving credit facility and $175 million available under our accounts receivable program (see the table below under Available Credit Capacity). Our total debt including convertible subordinated debentures was $1,645 million as of December 31, 2004, compared to $1,429 million, at December 31, 2003. Total debt, including our convertible subordinated debentures, as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 54.0 percent at December 31, 2004, compared to 60.1 percent at December 31, 2003. Included in long-term debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $81 million and $90 million, respectively, attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). Also included in short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2004, was $132 million from the consolidation of four joint ventures previously reported under the equity method of accounting and now consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). The consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our 2004 net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. We do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods. Restructuring Actions During the period 2000-2002, we recorded significant charges to restructure our operations, largely focused in our Engine Business. These actions and the resulting charges were primarily taken in response to the downturn in the North American trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions, asset impairment losses, termination of a new engine development program and other charges. Total net cash outflows associated with these actions approximated $91 million, including $25 million in 2002 and $2 million in 2003. The associated annual savings from these restructuring actions were estimated at $97 million. Certain of these restructuring actions are also described above and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . All of the restructuring actions were completed as of December 31, 2003. 46 Available Credit Capacity The table below provides the components of available credit capacity as of December 31: 2004 2003 $ Millions Revolving credit facility $ 530 $ 276 International credit facilities accessible by local entities 76 52 International credit facilities accessible by corporate treasury 38 36 Accounts receivable(1) 175 Total available credit capacity $ 819 $ 364 (1) Our previous accounts receivable program expired in December 2003 and in January 2004 we entered into a new three-year agreement for a similar program with a different financial institution (see discussion below under the caption Sale of Accounts Receivable ). Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased $503 million during 2004 and were $611 million at the end of the year compared to $108 million at the beginning of the year. Cash and cash equivalents were higher in 2004 as a result of an increase in cash provided by operations generated primarily by higher net earnings. The following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 2002 $ Millions Net cash provided by operating activities $ 614 $ 158 $ 193 Net cash used in investing activities (189 ) (135 ) (152 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 74 (145 ) 131 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 4 6 2 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 503 $ (116 ) $ 174 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities improved $456 million in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to higher net earnings ($300 million), increase in non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization expense ($49 million) and pension expense ($28 million). Net changes in working capital also provided $80 million in cash during 2004 compared to a $5 million use in 2003, or a net increase in cash provided by working capital of $85 million year-over-year. The increase was a result of increases in accounts payable ($110 million) and accrued expenses ($214 million), partially offset by increases in accounts receivable ($99 million) and inventories ($141 million). Accounts payable and inventory were higher in 2004 primarily from higher production levels necessary to meet increased demand and from the effects of consolidating entities under FIN 46R, ($70 million and $73 million, respectively). Accounts receivable increased due to higher sales levels and the impact of FIN 46R ($72 million) and accrued expenses increased primarily from payroll and variable compensation accruals ($87 million), pension liability ($22 million) and the impact of FIN 46R ($44 million). Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $54 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was due to higher capital expenditures ($40 million), increased investment in and advances to equity investees ($15 million), acquisition of a business ($18 million for purchase of a distributorship), partially offset by cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities ($22 million). The majority of our capital spending in 2004 included equipment for new product support and capacity expansion in our Engine and Filtration and Other segments. Our 2005 capital spending program is 47 expected to be in the range of $220 million to $240 million, primarily for increased capacity and funding investment in manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $74 million in 2004 compared to a net cash outlflow of $145 million in 2003, or a net change in cash inflows of $219 million year-over-year. Most of the change occurred from a significant cash outflow in March 2003 from the payment of our $125 million 6.25% Notes and significant cash inflows in 2004 from the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of a large number of stock options ($148 million). Cash Requirements A summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2004, is shown in the tables below: Contractual Cash Obligations 2005 2006-2007 2008-2009 After 2009 Total $ Millions Loans payable $ 62 $ $ $ $ 62 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations 284 151 94 1,054 1,583 Operating leases 61 94 70 104 329 Capital expenditures 88 88 Purchase commitments for inventory 391 391 Other purchase commitments 179 75 34 288 Pension funding obligations(1) 135 135 Total $ 1,200 $ 320 $ 198 $ 1,158 $ 2,876 (1) Pension funding obligations are included only for 2005 as the amount of our funding obligations beyond the next year are not yet determinable. Other Commercial Commitments 2005 2006-2007 2008-2009 After 2009 Total $ Millions Standby letters of credit under revolving credit agreement $ 106 $ 10 $ 2 $ $ 118 International and other domestic letters of credit 24 4 28 Performance and excise bonds 16 41 57 Other guarantees 16 1 17 Total $ 162 $ 10 $ 6 $ 42 $ 220 Financial Covenants and Credit Rating A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale-leaseback agreement, have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. Our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies and includes an annual assessment of the creditworthiness of our debt securities and other obligations. It is intended to measure the probability of timely repayment of principal and interest of our notes and short-term debt. Generally, a higher credit rating leads to a more favorable effect on the marketability and pricing of our debt instruments in the capital markets. A credit rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody or a rating of BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor s, two of the major credit rating agencies, is considered investment grade. Currently, the corporate credit rating of our debt securities is below investment grade. 48 Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides the circumstances warrant that change, and there can be no assurance that our debt ratings will not be lowered further or withdrawn by a rating agency. Any future lowering of our credit ratings could further increase the cost of our financing agreements and arrangements, and may have a negative impact on our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at current rates. Our current rating and ratings outlook from each of the credit rating agencies is shown in the table below, and remain unchanged from the prior year except each agency updated its ratings outlook from Negative to Stable in 2004. Each rating should be viewed independently of any other rating. Credit Rating Agency Senior L-T Debt Rating S-T Debt Rating Outlook Moody Investors Service, Inc. Ba2 Not Prime Stable Standard & Poor BB+ WR Stable Fitch BB- BB+ Stable We do not believe a further downgrade of our credit rating will have a material impact on our financial results, financial condition or access to sufficient liquidity. However, one of our corporate goals is to regain an investment grade credit rating from the rating agencies. To achieve this goal, we have placed significant management focus on earnings improvement, increased cash flow and debt reduction. The impact of credit ratings on our financing arrangements is discussed below. New Revolving Credit Facility In December 2004, we entered into a new revolving credit facility. The new facility replaced our previous $385 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in November 2005. Deferred debt issue costs related to the previous facility were expensed in the fourth quarter and were not material. The new facility provides for aggregate unsecured borrowings up to $650 million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of five years. Borrowings are primarily available in U.S. dollars, although up to $60 million of the facility is available for multicurrency borrowings and letters of credit, up to $200 million is available for total letters of credit and up to $50 million is available for swing-line loans. A number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the facility, although aggregate borrowings and letters of credit for our subsidiaries may not exceed $60 million. Subsidiary borrowings under the facility are guaranteed by us and the borrowing subsidiary. Certain of those guarantees are limited by the terms of our existing public indenture which governs a number of our outstanding notes and debentures. The indenture restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness, and their ability is also limited by similar terms in the indenture governing our $250 million Senior Notes. At our option, borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the following: the London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR) plus a spread ranging from 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent based on our credit rating, or the Alternate Base Rate rate or ABR (which is the greater of the administrative agent prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent) plus a spread ranging from 0 percent to 1.0 percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. In addition, we are required to pay quarterly fees on unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility, which are based on our credit rating, and also an annual administration fee to the administrative agent for the facility. 49 The terms of the revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to among other things, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into merger agreements, consolidation or asset sale transactions, dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries, incur subsidiary indebtedness and enter into speculative swap transactions. The revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to, under the terms of our existing public indenture, re-designate unrestricted subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries or designate future subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries. The revolving credit facility also includes the following financial covenants which are measured quarterly: the ratio of (1) the sum of our consolidated indebtedness and our securitization financings to (2) the sum of our consolidated EBITDA for any period of four consecutive quarters may not exceed 3.25 to 1.0 for the periods prior to December 31, 2006 and may not exceed 3.0 to 1.0 for the periods thereafter; and the ratio of (1) our consolidated EBITDA minus capital expenditures to (2) our consolidated interest expense for any period of four consecutive quarters, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.0. For purposes of the financial covenants described above, consolidated indebtedness, consolidated EBITDA, consolidated interest expense, securitization financings, capital expenditures and other financial measurements are calculated and defined by the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement. Legal and bank facility fees of $3.6 million related to this agreement were capitalized as deferred debt costs and will be amortized over the five year life of the facility. As of December 31, 2004, we had $118 million of letters of credit outstanding against this facility, no borrowings and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the agreement. Off Balance Sheet Financing Sale of Accounts Receivable In January 2004, we entered into a new three year facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Trade Receivables, LLC (CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary. As necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in Receivables, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $200 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as those described above under our revolving credit facility. The interest in receivables sold under this program to the financial institution in 2004 was not significant and as of December 31, 2004, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. Under our old program which expired on December 15, 2003, we had an agreement with a different financial institution where we sold a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Receivable Corporation (CRC), a special purpose subsidiary. Under this program, CRC transferred an interest in its receivables, without recourse, to limited purpose receivable securitization companies (conduits) that were established and maintained by an independent financial institution. The conduits would then fund their purchases by issuing commercial paper. No accounts receivable sold to either subsidiary were written off during 2004, 2003 or 2002. The weighted average interest rate on securitized repayments during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 2.6 percent, 1.2 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. The sold receivables servicing portfolio, which is included in 50 receivables at December 31, and the proceeds from the sale of receivables and other related cash flows are disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sale-Leaseback Transactions In 2001, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement with a variable interest entity (VIE) whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease. As a result of the Moody downgrade in April 2002, and a Standard & Poor downgrade in October 2002, we were required, under the lease agreement, to obtain irrevocable, unconditional standby letters of credit in an amount of $69 million. The letters of credit were posted to the benefit of the equipment lessor and lenders and will remain in effect until we achieve and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for 12 consecutive months. The sale-leaseback transaction is described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In December 2003, the grantor trust which acts as a lessor in the sale and lease back transaction discussed above was consolidated due to the adoption of FIN 46R. The impact of adopting FIN 46R and a description of the entities consolidated under FIN 46R are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the consolidation, the manufacturing equipment and the present value of the minimum lease payments were included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as property, plant and equipment and long-term debt, respectively. In addition, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings includes interest expense on the lessor debt obligations and depreciation expense on the manufacturing equipment rather than rent expense under the lease agreement. The cumulative effect of this transaction was recorded as a change in accounting principle effective December 31, 2003 and reduced net earnings by $6 million before related tax benefits of $2 million. The amount of interest expense and depreciation expense was $7 million and $11 million in 2004, respectively. The consolidation of the VIE did not impact our credit rating or compliance with our debt covenants. PowerRent Business In 1999, our Power Generation Business entered into an ongoing leasing program in which it built and sold power generation equipment to a financial institution and leased the equipment and related components back under a three-month, noncancelable lease arrangement with subsequent renewals on a monthly basis up to a maximum of 36 months. The equipment was sold at cost and pursuant to lease accounting rules; the excess of the fair value of the equipment sold over its cost was recognized as prepaid rent and reflected the normal profit margin that would have been realized at the time of sale. The margins on the equipment sales were deferred and the leases recorded as operating leases. The prepaid rent was amortized ratably over the accounting lease term. Upon termination of the leases through a sale of the equipment to a third party, the previously deferred margins on the sale to the financial institution were recorded as income. We sublease the equipment to customers under short-term rental agreements with terms that vary based upon customer and geographic region. In June 2004, the master lease agreement associated with this arrangement was amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries other than the U.S. The amendment required us to retain full residual risk on the equipment value at the end of the non-cancelable lease term. As a result of this amendment, the leases under this program were classified as capital leases. At the end of the non-cancelable lease term, we may either (1) extend the lease term for an additional period, (2) repurchase the equipment at the current guaranteed value, or (3) arrange for a sale of the equipment to a third party and pay the difference between the guaranteed value and the proceeds recovered from the sale. During 2002 and 2003, we entered into new leases for portions of the equipment with a different lessor ($29 million and $34 million, respectively). The new leases had a minimum two-year non-cancelable lease term with monthly renewal options for the 2002 transaction and four six-month renewal options for the 2003 transaction. The deferred margin associated with the equipment that transferred to the new lessor 51 remained unchanged, as there was not an ultimate sale to a third party. In December 2004, the master lease agreement associated with these leases was also amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries outside the U.S. This amendment required us to repurchase the equipment at the end of the two-year non-cancelable lease terms, and as a result, the leases were classified as capital leases. The financial impact of amending these leasing arrangements, which represent the substantial majority of the equipment under lease in our PowerRent program, resulted in an increase in our capital lease obligations by the present value of: (1) the remaining minimum lease payments, plus (2) any guaranteed residual or repurchase obligation at the time of amendment. In addition, we increased the amount of our property, plant and equipment by this same amount, reduced for the remaining deferred gains associated with the original sale-leaseback of the units discussed above. The equipment will be depreciated over its expected remaining useful life. The total increase in our property, plant and equipment at the time the leases were amended was $104 million. The balance of the capital lease obligations related to these programs at December 31, 2004, was $103 million. Future lease payments, including repurchase obligations, under each lease are included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We do not expect the reclassification of the leases to have a material impact on net earnings or affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. Financing Arrangements for Related Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures, sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value. We purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines, components and service parts from Consolidated Diesel Company (CDC), a general partnership that was formed in 1980 with J. I. Case (Case) to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity. Cummins and Case (now CNH Global N.V.) are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in CDC. Under the terms of the agreement, CDC is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners. Each partner is entitled to purchase up to one-half of CDC actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one-half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner purchase requirement. The partners are each obligated, unconditionally and severally, to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by CDC, provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced. The transfer price of CDC engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period, including interest and financing expenses, but excluding depreciation expense (other than Scheduled Depreciation Expense as defined in the agreement). In addition, each partner is obligated to contribute one-half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity, which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee. To date, neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at CDC. We are not a guarantor of any of CDC obligations or commitments. However, we are required as a partner, to provide up to 50 percent of CDC base working capital as defined by the agreement. The amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required, the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by CDC, or we may elect to fund the requirement, although we are under no obligation to do so. To date, when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount, we have elected to provide that funding to CDC. If the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital 52 amount, it is funded equally by the partners. Excess cash generated by CDC is remitted to Cummins until CDC working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount. Any further cash remittances from CDC to the partners are shared equally by the partners. In the first quarter of 2004, we adopted certain provisions of FIN 46R. Under the provisions of FIN 46R, CDC and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us were considered VIE and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of CDC and the other engine manufacturer as of March 28, 2004. Previously, these joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Investments in and advances to equity investees. First quarter results for these entities were recorded as Equity, royalty and other income from investees in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and results for the rest of the year were consolidated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For a further discussion of the impact of adopting FIN 46R, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing Arrangements and Guarantees of Distributors, Residual Value Guarantees and Other Guarantees and Indemnifications U. S. Distributors Since 1997 we have had an operating agreement with a financial institution that requires us to guarantee revolving loans, equipment term loans and leases, real property loans and letters of credit made by the financial institution to certain independent Cummins and Onan distributors in the United States, and to certain distributors in which we own an equity interest. The agreement has been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified several times since 1997 and in the third quarter of 2004, we amended, restated and simplified the terms of the operating agreement. Under the amended and restated terms, our guarantee of any particular distributor financing is limited to the amount of the financing in excess of the distributor borrowing base. The borrowing base is equal to the amount the distributor could borrow from the financial institution without a Cummins guarantee. Furthermore, if any distributor defaults under its financing arrangement with the financial institution, and the maturity of amounts owed under the agreement is accelerated, then we are required to purchase from the financial institution at amounts approximating fair market value certain property, inventory and rental power generation equipment manufactured by Cummins that are secured by the distributor financing agreement. The operating agreement will continue in effect until February 7, 2007, and may be renewed for additional one-year terms. As of December 31, 2004, we had $10 million of guarantees outstanding under the operating agreement relating to distributor borrowings of $122 million. Residual Value Guarantees Leased Equipment As more fully discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , we have various residual value guarantees on equipment leased under operating leases. The amount of those guarantees at December 31, 2004, was $11 million. Other Guarantees In addition to the guarantees discussed above, from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements, including non-North American distributor financing, guarantees of third party debt and other miscellaneous guarantees. The maximum potential loss related to these guarantees was $21 million at December 31, 2004. 53 We also have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties. The penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs. If we were to discontinue purchasing from these suppliers as of December 31, 2004, the penalties would approximate $37 million. However, we do not anticipate paying any supplier penalties under these arrangements based on our current forecast of purchasing volumes. Indemnifications Periodically we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third party against certain types of losses, including the following: product liability and license, patent or trademark indemnifications as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the sold asset; and any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter-party for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract. We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and accrue for expected losses that are probable. Because the indemnifications are not related to specific known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature, we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this annual report. We believe the application of our accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful, reliable and timely information about our earnings results, financial position and cash flows. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that often require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for product coverage programs, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill. 54 Product Coverage Programs We estimate and record a liability for product coverage programs, primarily base warranty, other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the time of failure. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record product coverage expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our product coverage liability account for 2004, 2003 and 2002 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2004, the Company has recorded net deferred tax assets of $ 960 million. These assets include $248 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in 2012. The ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a sustained level of profitability. Having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits, a valuation allowance of $39 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Should the Company operating performance deteriorate, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect our ability to sustain profitability include, but are not limited to, a decline in sales or gross margin, loss of market share, increased competition and existing and future regulatory emissions standards. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. However, we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans in the U.S., the U.K. and various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These 55 assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span, and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future . The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets used to develop our pension expense was 8.5%, 8.5% and 10.0% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The expected rate of return on non-U.S. pension plan assets was 8.08%, 8.44% and 8.53%. In 2005, we plan to use an expected rate of return of 8.5% for U.S pension plan assets and 7.5 % for non-U.S. pension plan assets. A lower rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. Our net periodic pension expense was $89 million in 2004, $61 million in 2003 and $21 million in 2002. Our net periodic pension expense is expected to be in a range of $105 million to $115 million in 2005. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The discount rate used to develop our net periodic pension expense in the U.S. was 6.25%, 7.0% and 7.25% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The discount rate for our non-U.S. pension expense was 5.66%, 5.91% and 6.34%. We will use 5.75% and 5.32% for U.S. and non-U.S. pension expense in 2005. Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation and due to the fact that the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is calculated on a present value basis, changes in the discount rate assumption will impact the current ABO. An increase in the ABO caused by a decrease in the discount rate may result in additional voluntary contributions to a pension plan as our funding strategy is to fund the plan approximately 90% on an ABO basis in the U.S. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2005 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. Impact on Pension Expense Inc (Dec) $ Millions Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25% increase $ (7.9 ) 0.25% decrease 7.4 Expected rate of return on assets: 1% increase (22.5 ) 1% decrease 22.4 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. The methodology used to determine the expected rate of return on the pension plan assets in the U.S. was based on a combination of two studies performed by independent consultants. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the 56 risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2004, 2003 and target allocation for 2005 are as follows: Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Investment description 2005 2004 2003 Equity securities 62.2 % 68.3 % 72.7 % Fixed income 29.8 % 24.9 % 27.0 % Real estate/Other 8.0 % 6.8 % 0.3 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002. This Act included temporary rules allowing companies to use, for funding purposes, discount rates for 2002 and 2003 equal to 120 percent of the weighted average 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond yield. During 2004 and 2003, we made cash contributions to our pension plans of $135 million and $118 million, respectively, and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $135 million in 2005. Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under the provisions of SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the carrying value of assets acquired, including goodwill, is reviewed annually. During the 2004 review, the fair value of the reporting units to which the assets, including goodwill, were assigned was carried forward from the previous year in compliance with certain criteria set forth in SFAS 142, except for the goodwill resulting from the consolidation of VIEs. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows before interest less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate its weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. As of the end of the third quarter in 2004, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by SFAS 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2004, our recorded goodwill was $355 million. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised version of FIN 46, FIN 46R. We adopted the provisions of FIN 46R in December 2003 for certain entities previously considered to be Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) under GAAP and for new entities created on or after February 1, 2003. The remaining provisions of FIN 46R were adopted as of March 28, 2004, resulting in the consolidation of three joint ventures previously accounted for under the equity method. In 57 the second quarter ended June 27, 2004, we consolidated another entity under the provisions of FIN 46R. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of FIN 46R. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2 , Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, (FSP 106-2) in response to a new law that provides a federal subsidy for prescription drug benefits under Medicare to certain sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. This FSP requires the effects of the subsidy and expected changes in plan participation be accounted for currently as an actuarial experience gain to be recognized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants and allows several implementation alternatives. We determined the effects of the Medicare Act were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore the adoption of FSP 106-2 did not require us to remeasure our liability or expense for postretirement benefits at an interim date. Rather, the effects of the Medicare Act were included in the determination of our annual postretirement plan liability in November 2004. A small, grandfathered portion of our retiree population qualifies for the Medicare subsidy under our current retiree health care plans. The subsidy lowered our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately 4 percent. The participation in our plans could decrease if participants elect the Medicare coverage. We have modeled the sensitivity of our APBO to reflect participation changes. If 10 percent of our retiree population left our plan and enrolled in Medicare, our APBO would be reduced an additional 3 percent. The net impact of the subsidy and a 10 percent hypothetical decline in population would not have been material to our 2004 expense. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) was signed into law by President Bush in October 2004. The Act includes a special one-year 85 percent deduction for qualifying dividends repatriated from foreign operations. Generally, the special 2005 repatriation rules are only beneficial on very low-taxed foreign earnings. We are studying the possible application of these rules to some foreign joint venture repatriations up to approximately $40 million that could potentially reduce our 2005 income tax provision by $5 million to $10 million. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead as an inventory cost. The new statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in SFAS 151 must be applied prospectively and become effective for us beginning January 1, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB published SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, (SFAS 123R). This statement requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions. Share-based payment transactions within the scope of SFAS 123R include stock options, restricted stock plans, performance-based awards, stock appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans. The provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, we will implement the revised standard in the third quarter of 2005. Currently, we account for stock-based employee awards using the fair value method preferred by SFAS 123 and therefore we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. This statement amends APB Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary 58 Transactions, to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that have no commercial substance. Under SFAS 153, if a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets meets a commercial-substance criterion and fair value is determinable, the transaction must be accounted for at fair value resulting in recognition of any gain or loss. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary transactions in fiscal periods that begin after June 15, 2005 and becomes effective for us beginning July 1, 2005. We do not expect the adoption SFAS 153 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
