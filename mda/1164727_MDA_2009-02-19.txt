ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont, the Company, our and we ). References to A$ refer to Australian currency, C$ to Canadian currency, NZ$ to New Zealand currency, IDR to Indonesian currency and $ to United States currency. This discussion addresses matters we consider important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2008, as well as our future results. It consists of the following subsections: Overview, which provides a brief summary of our consolidated results and financial position and the primary factors affecting those results, as well as a summary of our expectations for 2009; Accounting Developments, which provides a discussion of recent changes to our accounting policies that have affected our consolidated results and financial position; Critical Accounting Policies, which provides an analysis of the accounting policies we consider critical because of their effect on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses in our consolidated financial statements and/or because they require difficult, subjective or complex judgments by our management; Consolidated Financial Results, which includes a discussion of our consolidated financial results for the last three years; Results of Consolidated Operations, which sets forth an analysis of the operating results for the last three years; Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, which summarizes recently published authoritative accounting guidance, how it might apply to us and how it might affect our future results; and Liquidity and Capital Resources, which contains a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, investing activities and financing activities, contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. This item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and Fortune 500, and was the first gold company included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties. We have significant assets or operations in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico. We face key risks associated with our business. One of the most significant risks is fluctuation in the prices of gold and copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Other challenges we face include capital and production cost increases and social, political and environmental issues. Operating costs at our mines are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing commodity prices, ore grades, metallurgy, revisions to mine plans and changes in accounting principles. At foreign locations, operating costs are also influenced by currency fluctuations that may affect our U.S. dollar operating costs. In addition, we must continually replace reserves depleted 37 Table of Contents through production by expanding known ore bodies, by acquisition or by locating new deposits in order to offset the organic decline in production levels which occurs over the long term. Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance The table below highlights key financial and operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 6,199 $ 5,526 $ 4,882 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 829 $ (963 ) $ 563 Net income (loss) $ 853 $ (1,886 ) $ 791 Net income (loss) per common share, basic: Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 1.83 $ (2.13 ) $ 1.25 Net income (loss) $ 1.88 $ (4.17 ) $ 1.76 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands) (1) 6,255 6,184 7,186 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 290 428 435 Average price received, net (2) Gold (per ounce) $ 874 $ 697 $ 594 Copper (per pound) $ 2.59 $ 2.86 $ 1.54 Costs applicable to sales (3) Gold (per ounce) $ 440 $ 389 $ 288 Copper (per pound) $ 1.38 $ 1.05 $ 0.67 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 20, 6 and 100 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Incremental start-up includes the removal and production of de minimis saleable materials during development and is recorded as Other income , net of incremental mining and processing costs. (2) After treatment and refining charges and excluding settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. (3) Excludes Amortization , Accretion , the 2007 Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and the 2007 Midas redevelopment . Consolidated Financial Performance Gold revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in the average realized price and an increase in consolidated gold ounces sold. Gold sales increased to 6.3 million ounces in 2008 from 6.2 million ounces in 2007, primarily due to higher production at Yanacocha, Ahafo and Australia/New Zealand, partially offset by lower production at Batu Hijau and Nevada. Copper revenues decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to lower throughput, grade and recovery at Batu Hijau and a decrease in the average realized price (see Results of Consolidated Operations below). The gold price increases over the last three years were partially offset by lower production and higher production costs as we have seen significant increases in the costs of labor, fuel, power and other bulk consumables. In addition, our 2008 financial and operating results were impacted by the following: Reclamation and remediation costs ($102, primarily at former mining operations); Advanced projects, research and development expense ($166, primarily at our Fort a la Corne JV diamond, Hope Bay, Euronimba and Ghana investments); Losses on write-down of marketable equity securities and other assets ($251, as the credit crisis affected the market for junior mining companies); 38 Table of Contents Write-down of property, plant and mine development ($137, primarily related to assets in Canada, Indonesia and Nevada); and Tax planning and restructuring ($159). Liquidity Our financial position was as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 Total debt $ 3,542 $ 2,938 Total stockholders equity $ 7,102 $ 7,548 Cash and cash equivalents $ 435 $ 1,231 Marketable equity securities $ 621 $ 1,500 During 2008 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net proceeds from the issuance of debt of $591; Net cash provided from continuing operations of $1,403; Capital expenditures of $1,875; Completion of the Miramar acquisition for $325; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $182; Dividends paid to minority interests of $389; and Changes in the value of our marketable equity securities as a result of broad declines in the equity markets. Looking Forward Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Fluctuations in gold and copper prices; We expect higher 2009 consolidated gold sales of approximately 6.35 to 6.85 million ounces, primarily as a result of the start-up of Boddington, completion of the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% of Boddington, as well as increased gold sales at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau, partially offset by lower sales in Nevada; Costs applicable to sales gold for 2009 are expected to be approximately $400 to $440 per ounce due to the start-up of lower cost production from Boddington (100%), higher expected gold sales from our Yanacocha and Batu Hijau operations, as well as lower oil price and Australian dollar exchange rate assumptions, partially offset by lower by-product credits resulting from lower copper price assumptions; We expect 2009 consolidated copper sales of approximately 460 to 510 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per pound as a result of higher expected sales, processing higher grade ore and lower waste removal costs. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,400 to $1,600 in 2009, with approximately 60% in Australia/New Zealand, 15% in Nevada and the remaining 25% invested at other locations. Approximately 45% of the 2009 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 55% allocated to project development initiatives, including completion of the Boddington project (100%) in Australia; 39 Table of Contents In March 2009, we expect to close the acquisition transaction for the additional 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. for $750 payable in cash at closing, $240 payable in cash and/or Newmont common stock, at our option, in December 2009, and a royalty capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized operating margin (Revenue less Costs applicable to sales on a by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce, payable on one-third of gold sales from Boddington. We expect 2009 exploration expenditures of approximately $165 to $175 and 2009 advanced projects, research and development expenditures of approximately $120 to $150. In February 2009, we completed a public offering of $518 convertible senior notes, maturing February 15, 2012 for net proceeds of $504. In February 2009, we completed a public offering of 34,500,000 of our common shares for net proceeds of $1,233. The completion of the Boddington project as well as potential future investments in the Hope Bay project in Canada, the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained; and Our 2009 expectations, particularly with respect to sales volumes and costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound, may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to the start-up of our Boddington project (100%) and variations in: mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices, foreign currency exchange rates and gold and copper sales prices. Accounting Developments Variable Interest Entities In December 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Staff Position No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities ( FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 ). This FSP amends FASB Statement No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets. It also amends FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities as revised to require public enterprises to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ). FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 are effective for the Company fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. Newmont has adopted the disclosure requirements of FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 in the Company VIE disclosures. Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( FAS 162 ) which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). FAS 162 was effective November 15, 2008, which was 60 days following the Security and Exchange Commission approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with GAAP. The 40 Table of Contents adoption of FAS 162 has had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Fair Value Accounting In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of FAS 157 were adopted January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB staff issued FSP No. 157-2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 ( FSP FAS 157-2 ). FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The provisions of FSP FAS 157-2 are effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009, and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active ( FSP FAS 157-3 ), which clarifies the application of FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ) in an inactive market. The intent of this FSP is to provide guidance on how the fair value of a financial asset is to be determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive. FSP FAS 157-3 states that determining fair value in an inactive market depends on the facts and circumstances, requires the use of significant judgment and in some cases, observable inputs may require significant adjustment based on unobservable data. Regardless of the valuation technique used, an entity must include appropriate risk adjustments that market participants would make for nonperformance and liquidity risks when determining fair value of an asset in an inactive market. FSP FAS 157-3 was effective upon issuance. We have incorporated the principles of FSP FAS 157-3 in determining the fair value of financial assets when the market for those assets is not active, specifically its marketable debt securities. FAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are described below: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; Level 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). 41 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by FAS 157, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair Value at December 31, 2008 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Cash equivalents $ 14 $ 14 $ $ Marketable equity securities 621 621 Marketable debt securities 27 27 $ 662 $ 635 $ $ 27 Liabilities: Trade payable from provisional copper and gold concentrate sales, net $ 5 $ 5 $ $ Derivative instruments, net 140 140 8 5 / 8 % debentures (hedged portion) 92 92 $ 237 $ 5 $ 232 $ Our cash equivalent instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The cash instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Our marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by us. Our marketable debt securities include investments in auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper. We review fair value for auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper on at least a quarterly basis. The auction rate securities are traded in markets that are not active, trade infrequently and have little price transparency. We estimated the fair values based on weighted average risk calculations using probabilistic cash flow assumptions. In January 2009, the investments in our asset backed commercial paper were restructured under court order. The restructuring allowed an interest distribution to be made to investors. The auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our net trade payable from provisional copper and gold concentrate sales is valued using quoted market prices based on the forward London Metal Exchange ( LME ) (copper) and the London Bullion Market Association P.M. fix ( London P.M. fix ) (gold) and, as such, is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative instruments are valued using pricing models and we generally use similar models to value similar instruments. Where possible, we verify the values produced by our pricing models to market prices. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit spreads, measures of volatility, and correlations of such inputs. Our derivatives trade in liquid markets, and as such, model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We have fixed to floating swap contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk exposure of our 8 5 / 8 % uncollateralized debentures due May 2011. The hedged portion of our 8 5 / 8 % debentures are valued using pricing models which require inputs, including risk-free interest rates and credit spreads. Because the inputs are derived from observable market data, the hedged portion of the 8 5 / 8 % debentures is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 42 Table of Contents The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of our Level 3 financial assets (asset backed commercial paper and auction rate securities) for the year ended December 31, 2008. Balance at beginning of period $ 31 Unrealized losses (7 ) Transfers in auction rate securities 3 Balance at end of period $ 27 Unrealized losses of $6 for the period were included in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a result of changes in C$ exchange rates from December 31, 2007. Unrealized losses of $1 for the period were included in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a result of mark-to-market changes from December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent 4% of the total assets measured at fair value. In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( FAS 159 ). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the objective of improving financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of FAS 159 were adopted January 1, 2008. We did not elect the Fair Value Option for any of our financial assets or liabilities, and therefore, the adoption of FAS 159 had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) reached consensus on Issue No. 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards ( EITF 06-11 ). EITF 06-11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend and dividend equivalents paid on equity-classified nonvested shares and nonvested share units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 has been applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The adoption of EITF 06-11 had an insignificant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, ( FIN 48 ) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in the application of the income tax laws to our operations. The interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax provisions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The cumulative effects of applying this interpretation were recorded as a decrease in retained earnings of $108, an increase of $5 in goodwill, an increase of $4 in minority interest, a decrease in net deferred tax assets of $37 (primarily, as a result of utilization of foreign tax credits and net operating losses as part of the FIN 48 measurement process, offset, in part, by the impact of the interaction of the Alternative Minimum Tax rules) and an increase of $72 in the net liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. Pensions As of December 31, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( FAS 158 ). FAS 158 requires employers that sponsor one or more defined benefit plans to (i) recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, (ii) recognize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, (iii) measure the defined 43 Table of Contents benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position, and (iv) disclose in the notes to the financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The impact of adopting FAS 158 decreased Accumulated other comprehensive income by $27 as of December 31, 2006. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment ( FAS 123(R) ). We adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 included: a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R). As a result of adopting FAS 123(R), our Income from continuing operations and Net income for 2008 and 2006 was $10 ($0.02 per share) and $19 ($0.04 per share) lower, respectively, and Loss from continuing operations and Net loss for 2007 was $11 ($0.02 per share) higher than if we had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25 as we did prior to January 1, 2006. Deferred Stripping Costs On January 1, 2006 we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-06 ( EITF 04-06 ), Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry. EITF 04-06 addresses the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine and refers to these costs as variable production costs that should be included as a component of inventory to be recognized in Costs applicable to sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of inventory. As a result, capitalization of post-production stripping costs is appropriate only to the extent product inventory exists at the end of a reporting period. The guidance required the recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption, with no charge to earnings in the period of adoption for prior periods. The cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by $81 (net of tax and minority interests). Adoption of EITF 04-06 had no impact on our cash position or net cash from operations. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Carrying Value of Goodwill As of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of goodwill was approximately $188. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill was assigned to various mine site reporting units in the Australia/New Zealand Segment. Our approach to allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units that we believed had contributed to such excess purchase price. We then performed valuations to measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already captured in the fair values assigned to such units identifiable net assets. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. 44 Table of Contents To accomplish this, we compare the estimated fair values of the reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value at the time of the evaluation, we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount and any shortfall would be charged to earnings. Assumptions underlying fair value estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties. Mine Site Goodwill The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was based on synergies that have been incorporated into our operations and business plans over time. The amount of goodwill assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining operations. We believe that triggering events with respect to the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease in our long-term gold and copper price assumptions; (ii) a decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the estimated fair value of mine site exploration potential; and (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine site production levels or costs. We performed our annual impairment test of mine site goodwill as of December 31, 2008 and determined that the fair value of each mine site reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value as of December 31, 2008. For more information on the discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets, below. Exploration Segment Goodwill In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Exploration Segment was impaired and the full value of goodwill was written-off. The Exploration Segment is responsible for all activities, whether near-mine or greenfield, associated with the Company efforts to discover new mineralized material that could ultimately advance into proven and probable reserves. As discussed in greater detail below, when performing its Exploration Segment goodwill impairment testing, the Company used historic additions to proven and probable reserves as an indication of the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment. The Exploration Segment valuation model attributed all cash flows expected to be derived from future greenfield exploration discoveries, to the Exploration Segment. The valuation model included management best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production. Historical proven and probable reserve additions, excluding acquisitions, were used as an indicator of the Exploration Segment ability to discover additional reserves in the future. The valuation model assumed that the Company would be able to perpetually develop and produce the assumed additions to proven and probable reserves from future discoveries at existing or new mine site reporting units. Actual reserve additions have varied significantly from year to year due to the time required to advance a deposit from initial discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we performed an impairment test of the Exploration Segment goodwill. Based on the Exploration Segment historic additions to proven and probable reserves and management best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production, the Exploration Segment estimated fair value was negligible. The decreased value attributable to the Exploration Segment resulted primarily from adverse changes in valuation assumptions and the application of a revised industry definition of value beyond proved and probable reserves ( VBPP ). The changes to valuation assumptions included: (i) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of increased spending and reduced exploration success. The revised definition of VBPP ascribes more value to tangible mineral interest than the original definition used by the Company. As a result of applying the new 45 Table of Contents definition of VBPP, the higher value ascribed to the Exploration Segment tangible mineral interests reduced the implied value of the Exploration Segment goodwill to a negligible value. Based on the negligible valuation, the Exploration Segment goodwill was impaired and the full $1,122 of goodwill was recorded as a non-cash write-down as of December 31, 2007. Merchant Banking Goodwill During June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to cease Merchant Banking activities. Merchant Banking previously provided advisory services to assist in managing our portfolio of operating and property interests. Merchant Banking was also engaged in developing value optimization strategies for operating and non-operating assets, business development activities, merger and acquisition analysis and negotiations, monetizing inactive exploration properties, capitalizing on proprietary technology and know-how and acting as an internal resource for other corporate groups to improve and maximize business outcomes. As a result of the Board approval of management plan to cease Merchant Banking activities, we recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill associated with the Merchant Banking Segment during the second quarter of 2007. Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These factors could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. 46 Table of Contents The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at each stockpile average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and processed further. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our stockpiles had a total carrying value of $993 (Batu Hijau, $612; Nevada, $214; Australia/New Zealand, $98; others, $69) and $732, respectively. Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles. We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and actual production levels. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit as of December 31, 2008, included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, and a long-term gold price of $800 per ounce. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, write-downs of stockpiles to NRV totaled $2, $14 and $2, respectively. Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Carrying Value of Ore on Leach Pads Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined, crushed, and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. The estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), 47 Table of Contents the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, the Company operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit as of December 31, 2008, apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $800 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.25 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.75 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. During 2008, the Company recorded write-downs of $18 to reduce the carrying value of ore on leach pads to NRV, primarily related to Kori Kollo (Other operations). Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit as of December 31, 2008, apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $800 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.25 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.75 per A$1.00. During 2008, the Company recorded write-downs of $137 to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development, primarily related to mineral interests and other assets in Canada, Indonesia and Nevada. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. 48 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described below in Note 21), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income (loss), except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income (loss) when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. All derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against future foreign currency expenditures or future diesel expenditures, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future foreign currency or diesel expenditures are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated income (loss) immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement Obligations) Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Income and Mining Taxes We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. 49 Table of Contents Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. As of January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48 guidance to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Consolidated Financial Results Sales gold, net for 2008 increased $1,142 compared to 2007 due to a $177 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges and 57,000 additional ounces sold. Sales gold, net for 2007 increased $94 compared to 2006 due to a $103 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges partially offset by 908,000 fewer ounces sold. The following analysis summarizes the change in consolidated gold sales revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Consolidated gold sales: Gross $ 5,460 $ 4,332 $ 4,241 Less: Treatment and refining charges (13 ) (27 ) (30 ) Net $ 5,447 $ 4,305 $ 4,211 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands): Gross 6,255 6,184 7,186 Less: Incremental start-up sales (1) (20 ) (6 ) (100 ) Net 6,235 6,178 7,086 Average realized gold price per ounce: Before treatment and refining charges $ 876 $ 701 $ 599 After treatment and refining charges $ 874 $ 697 $ 594 The change in consolidated gold sales is due to: 2008 vs. 2007 vs. 2007 2006 Increase (decrease) in consolidated ounces sold $ 40 $ (544 ) Increase in average realized gold price 1,088 635 Decrease in treatment and refining charges 14 3 $ 1,142 $ 94 (1) Incremental start-up includes the removal and production of de minimis saleable materials during development and is recorded as Other income , net of incremental mining and processing costs. 50 Table of Contents Sales copper, net decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower sales volume and lower realized prices. Sales copper, net increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher realized prices as the final deliveries were made pursuant to the copper collar contracts through February 2007, partially offset by lower production. For a complete discussion regarding variations in copper volumes, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. The following analysis reflects the changes in consolidated copper sales: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Consolidated copper sales: Gross before derivative contracts $ 878 $ 1,409 $ 1,333 Provisional pricing mark-to-market (47 ) (34 ) 165 Hedging losses (1 ) (633 ) Gross after derivative contracts 831 1,374 865 Less: Treatment and refining charges (79 ) (153 ) (194 ) Net $ 752 $ 1,221 $ 671 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 290 428 435 Average realized price per pound: Gross before derivative contracts $ 3.03 $ 3.30 $ 3.07 Provisional pricing mark-to-market (0.16 ) (0.09 ) 0.38 Hedging losses (1.46 ) Gross after derivative contracts 2.87 3.21 1.99 Less: Treatment and refining charges (0.28 ) (0.35 ) (0.45 ) Net $ 2.59 $ 2.86 $ 1.54 The change in consolidated copper sales is due to: 2008 vs. 2007 vs. 2007 2006 Decrease in consolidated pounds sold $ (443 ) $ (15 ) (Decrease) increase in average realized copper price (100 ) 524 Decrease in treatment and refining charges 74 41 $ (469 ) $ 550 51 Table of Contents The following is a summary of consolidated gold and copper sales, net: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Gold Nevada, USA $ 1,929 $ 1,616 $ 1,441 Yanacocha, Peru 1,613 1,093 1,543 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 321 305 250 Kalgoorlie, Australia 264 224 198 Jundee, Australia 342 214 190 Waihi, New Zealand 123 66 71 1,050 809 709 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 261 351 264 Africa Ahafo, Ghana 435 306 124 Other Operations: La Herradura, Mexico 83 61 48 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 75 60 77 Golden Giant, Canada 8 35 158 129 160 Corporate 1 1 (30 ) $ 5,447 $ 4,305 $ 4,211 Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia $ 752 $ 1,221 $ 671 Costs applicable to sales gold increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher diesel costs and higher royalty and workers participation expenses, partially offset by lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau and higher by-product sales. The increase in 2007 from 2006 resulted from increased labor and diesel costs, the strengthening of the Australian dollar, a full year of operations at Ahafo in Ghana and Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and higher waste removal costs at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales copper decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to lower waste removal costs, partially offset by higher diesel, labor and milling costs. Costs applicable to sales copper increased in 2007 from 2006 due to higher waste removal costs at Batu Hijau. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Amortization increased in 2008 from 2007 due to increased production at Australia/New Zealand and Ahafo, a larger portion of Nevada production being sourced from the Phoenix and Leeville operations and the start-up of the gold mill at Yanacocha and the power plant in Nevada. Amortization increased in 2007 from 2006 due to a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and Ahafo in Ghana. Amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of production amortization method for mineral interests and mine development. For a complete discussion, see Results of Consolidated Operations , below. We expect Amortization to increase to approximately $775 to $825 in 2009 (with 100% ownership of the Boddington project). 52 Table of Contents The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales and Amortization by operation: Costs Applicable to Sales Amortization Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 Gold Nevada, USA $ 1,022 $ 1,021 $ 960 $ 246 $ 220 $ 180 Yanacocha, Peru 637 490 450 170 160 172 Australia/New Zealand: Tanami, Australia 220 181 150 39 37 30 Kalgoorlie, Australia 231 191 158 16 24 25 Jundee, Australia 149 138 107 34 26 26 Waihi, New Zealand 55 42 23 33 22 10 655 552 438 122 109 91 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 124 114 86 25 25 20 Africa Ahafo, Ghana 205 168 52 63 43 19 Other Operations: La Herradura, Mexico 38 29 19 8 7 8 Kori Kollo, Bolivia 64 28 26 10 10 9 Golden Giant, Canada 2 12 1 102 59 57 18 17 18 2,745 2,404 2,043 644 574 500 Copper Batu Hijau, Indonesia 399 450 292 80 96 66 Other Exploration 1 1 3 Australia/New Zealand 3 3 3 Other Operations 1 Hope Bay, Canada 1 Corporate and Other 18 21 16 23 25 23 $ 3,144 $ 2,854 $ 2,335 $ 747 $ 695 $ 589 The Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts of $531 in 2007 resulted from the elimination of the entire 1.85 million ounces of forward sales contracts that would have impacted results in 2008 and beyond. Midas redevelopment of $11 in 2007 resulted from activities undertaken, during the period in which operations were suspended, to regain entry into the mine in order to resume commercial production following a fatal accident that occurred in June 2007. Exploration increased to $214 in 2008 from $177 in 2007 reflecting increased activity in response to higher gold prices and increased drilling, labor and consumable costs primarily at Hope Bay, Ghana and Conga. We expect Exploration spending to be approximately $165 to $175 in 2009, a decrease from 2008, due to a reduced drilling program related to the Company focus on net cash flow generation and a more selective and strategic exploration program. The decrease may adversely 53 Table of Contents affect the timing and extent of new mineral discoveries and the replacement of reserves. Once mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Advanced Projects, research and development includes the following: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Hope Bay $ 39 $ $ Fort a la Corne JV 26 Technical and project services 23 15 25 Euronimba 15 7 3 Akyem 7 6 15 Phoenix 6 7 10 Conga 4 3 6 Other 46 24 22 $ 166 $ 62 $ 81 Advanced projects, research and development includes project management costs, feasibility studies and drilling costs. Significant projects include the Hope Bay gold project in Nunavut, Canada purchased with the December 2007 Miramar acquisition; the Fort a la Corne JV diamond project in Saskatchewan, Canada; the Euronimba iron ore project in Guinea; the Akyem gold project in Ghana and the Conga copper and gold project in Peru. Fort a la Corne JV was included in Exploration in 2007 and 2006 with spending of $17 and $6, respectively. We expect Advanced projects, research and development spending to be approximately $120 to $150 in 2009, a decrease from 2008, due to a focus on net cash flow generation. The decrease in project development spending may adversely affect the timing of our ability to complete certain projects. General and administrative expense remained stable over the period from 2006 to 2008. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 2.3% in 2008, compared to 2.6% and 2.8% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect General and administrative expenses to be approximately $140 to $150 in 2009. Write-down of goodwill in 2007 was $1,122 ($nil for 2008 and 2006) and was related to the Exploration segment. The impairment resulted primarily from adverse changes in valuation assumptions and the application of a revised industry definition of value beyond proven and probable reserves ( VBPP ). The changes to valuation assumptions included: (i) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of increased spending and reduced exploration success. The revised definition of VBPP ascribes more value to tangible mineral interest than the original definition used by the Company. As a result of applying the new definition of VBPP, the higher value ascribed to the Exploration Segment tangible mineral interests reduced the implied value of the Exploration Segment goodwill to a negligible value. Write-down of property, plant and mine development totaled $137, $10 and $3 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 write-down primarily related to mineral interests and other assets in Canada, Indonesia and Nevada. The Fort a la Corne JV assets were impaired based on 2008 geologic results and potential project economics leading to our decision to cease funding our share of project development costs after January 2009. The assets were written-down to estimated recoverable value. The 2007 write-down primarily related to assets in Indonesia and Australia. The 2006 write-down related to assets in Peru and Indonesia. For a discussion of our policy for assessing the carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical Accounting Policies, above. 54 Table of Contents Other expense, net includes the following: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Reclamation estimate revisions $ 102 $ 29 $ 47 Community development 65 58 55 Regional administration 48 38 38 Western Australia power plant 18 11 1 Peruvian royalty 18 10 22 Batu Hijau divestiture and arbitration 15 3 Pension settlement loss 13 17 World Gold Council dues 11 11 13 Accretion, non-operating 10 8 3 Provision for bad debts 9 1 Buyat Bay settlement and other 3 12 22 Other 48 48 50 $ 360 $ 246 $ 251 During 2008 we reclassified community development and regional administration from Costs applicable to sales to Other expense, net . The 2007 and 2006 amounts were reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. Reclamation estimate revisions relate to changes in environmental obligation estimates at inactive mines. Revisions in 2008 were primarily for Mt. Leyshon in Australia and the Midnite mine in Washington, USA. Pension settlement losses relate to senior management retirements. The Buyat Bay settlement relates to legal and other costs incurred in regards to pollution allegations at the former Minahasa mine site. Beginning in 2006, Yanacocha recorded a charge to Other expense, net related to an agreement with the Peruvian government to provide for a negotiated royalty payment during high metal prices for community improvements. The negotiated royalty is based on 3.75% of Yanacocha net income beginning January 1, 2006 for a period of up to five years. Other income, net is summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Canadian Oil Sands Trust income $ 110 $ 47 $ 30 Gain on sale of exploration property 32 Gain on sale of investments, net 30 Interest income 29 50 67 Income from development projects, net 12 3 19 Gain on other asset sales, net 10 16 19 Gain (loss) on ineffective portion of derivative instruments, net 10 4 (60 ) Foreign currency exchange (losses) gains, net (12 ) 25 5 Write-down of investments (114 ) (46 ) Loss on early retirement of debt (40 ) Other 16 7 13 $ 123 $ 106 $ 53 55 Table of Contents Canadian Oil Sands Trust income increased in 2008 due to significantly higher oil prices through the majority of 2008. Gain on sale of investments, net in 2008 was attributable to the sale of marketable equity securities. Interest income decreased due to lower investment yields and reduced levels of invested funds. Income from development projects includes gold and copper sales, net of incremental operating costs incurred, from de minimis production prior to commercial operation. Income from development projects included the Awonsu pit in Ahafo in 2008, the Bobstar pit in Nevada in 2007 and the Phoenix and Leeville operations in Nevada in 2006. The 2006 loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments includes $56 for the copper collar instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Other losses relate to the ineffective portion of legacy gold puts held in Australia. Foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly in the fourth quarter. The Australian dollar exchange rate decreased by approximately 22% from December 31, 2007. Write-down of investments totaled $114, $46, and $nil in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily related to the impairment of investments in Shore Gold Inc. and Gabriel Resources Ltd. in both 2008 and 2007. In 2006, we settled our remaining obligations under the prepaid forward gold sales contract and forward gold purchase contract which required delivery of 17,951 ounces of gold in December 2006 and 179,062 ounces of gold in June 2007. This settlement resulted in cash payments of $96, a $48 reduction to the current portion of long-term debt and a $40 pre-tax loss on early retirement of debt. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest was $102, $105 and $97 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $47, $50 and $57 in each year, respectively. Interest costs decreased in 2008 primarily due to the repayment of borrowings at Batu Hijau and Australia, partially offset by increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility and a full year of interest on the $1,150 convertible senior notes issued in July 2007. Interest costs increased in 2007 due to the issuance of the $1,150 convertible senior notes and the $200 bond issuance at Yanacocha in July 2006. These increases were partially offset by capitalized interest due to construction of Leeville, Phoenix and the power plant in Nevada, the Ahafo project in Ghana and the Boddington project in Australia. We expect Interest expense, net of capitalized interest to be approximately $150 to $160 in 2009 due to higher levels of debt related to the February 2009 public offering of $518 convertible senior notes and the adoption of a recent accounting pronouncement, FSP APB 14-1, which will increase non-cash interest expense by approximately $55 (see Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below). Income tax expense was $113 in 2008, compared to $200 and $326 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rates were 9%, (57%), and 26% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Without the $1,122 goodwill impairment charge in 2007 (which is not deductible for tax purposes and for which no related income tax benefit can be claimed), the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 26%. The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion and resource allowances, the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to minority interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties, foreign currency translation gains and losses, impacts of the analysis of income taxes payable and U.S. book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, goodwill impairment and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are available to us under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in our consolidated United States income tax return. The deductions are highly 56 Table of Contents sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company. For 2006 and prior years, similar types of deductions were available for mining operations in Canada. The tax benefits from percentage depletion and resource allowances were $130, $70 and $77 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily is due to the increase in gold price. We operate in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a foreign rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make our ability to fully utilize all of our available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower prices or higher costs can result in our having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on our foreign earnings included in our annual United States consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, resulted in an increase of income tax expense of $5, $10 and $7, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested contributed to an increase in our income tax expense of $20, $7 and $70 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in our effective tax reconciliation in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in a net tax benefit of $nil, $4 and $71 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net tax benefit in 2007 is primarily related to a decrease in Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates and a decrease in New Zealand tax rates. The net tax benefit in 2006 is primarily related to adopting the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for Australian tax reporting purposes and a decrease in the Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates. The need to record valuation allowances related to our deferred tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) our long-term estimate of future average realized minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements that apply to us and our subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up-front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards in circumstances where future sources of taxable income may not coincide with available carry forward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued for financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to valuation allowances increased income tax expense by $31, and decreased income tax expense by $17 and $3 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The change in 2008 primarily is related to losses recorded on the decrease in value of certain marketable securities investments. We consolidate certain subsidiaries of which we do not own 100% of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, we are only responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to our ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such minority interests contributed $19, $4 and $15 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as reductions in our income tax expense. In 2008, tax expense decreased by $69 relating to the reduction in income taxes resulting from revised estimates of reserves for uncertain income tax positions recorded under FIN 48 in jurisdictions 57 Table of Contents where statutes of limitations expired or where uncertain income tax positions were considered effectively settled. Our tax expense decreased by $21, $nil and $1 in 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2008, this amount is the U.S. income tax effect of realized translation losses attributable to Canadian dollar-denominated debt instruments that were converted to equity. Because we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings from Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, no offsetting United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded. During 2008, tax expense decreased by $159 related to restructuring the form of one of the Company non-US subsidiaries. This transaction gave rise to a significant loss that will allow the Company to recover income taxes paid in prior years. During 2006 we completed a reconciliation of our U.S. book and tax basis assets and liabilities as well as a detailed analysis of our income taxes payable. This exercise identified differences of $27, which was recognized as a tax benefit in 2006. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 32% in 2009. Minority interest in income (loss) of consolidated subsidiaries was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Yanacocha $ 232 $ 108 $ 256 Batu Hijau 98 299 103 Other (1 ) 3 4 $ 329 $ 410 $ 363 Minority interest in income of subsidiaries decreased in 2008 from 2007 as a result of lower earnings at Batu Hijau partially offset by increased earnings at Yanacocha (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations and Yanacocha Operations). The 2007 increase from 2006 resulted from increased earnings at Batu Hijau and a $25 charge in 2007 related to the repayment of the carried interest loan at Batu Hijau, partially offset by decreased earnings at Yanacocha (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations and Yanacocha Operations). Equity (loss) income of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AGR Matthey Joint Venture $ (2 ) $ 1 $ 1 Regis Resources NL (3 ) (8 ) (2 ) European Gold Refineries 6 3 $ (5 ) $ (1 ) $ 2 In 2008, Newmont purchased additional shares of European Gold Refineries ( EGR ) resulting in consolidation. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the acquisition. 58 Table of Contents Income (loss) from discontinued operations was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Sales gold, net $ $ 119 $ 157 Income from operations: Royalty portfolio $ 6 $ 123 $ 67 Pajingo 8 12 Zarafshan 6 6 131 85 Gain on sale of operations: Pajingo 1 8 Zarafshan 77 Holloway 13 1 85 13 Gain on sale of royalty assets 905 Gain on sale of Alberta oil sands project 266 Gain on sale of Martabe 30 Loss on impairment of goodwill and other assets (1,665 ) (101 ) Pre-tax income (loss) 7 (544 ) 293 Income tax benefit (expense) 17 (379 ) (65 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 24 $ (923 ) $ 228 Discontinued operations include our royalty portfolio and Pajingo operation, both sold in 2007, as well as the Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture ( Zarafshan ) expropriated by the Uzbekistan government in 2006 and the Holloway operation and Martabe project, both sold in 2006. In December 2007, we sold substantially all of Pajingo assets for cash and marketable equity securities totaling $23 resulting in a gain of $8. Additional Pajingo asset sales resulted in a gain of $1 in 2008. In June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to cease Merchant Banking activities. As part of this plan, we decided to dispose of the assets recorded in our royalty portfolio and a portion of our marketable equity securities portfolio and to cease further investments in marketable equity securities that do not support our core gold mining business. In June 2007, we recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill associated with the Merchant Banking Segment. In December 2007, we received net cash proceeds of $1,187 and recognized a gain of $905 related to the sale of the royalty portfolio. In 2008, we recognized additional royalty portfolio revenue of $6 in excess of our 2007 estimate and recorded a $19 tax benefit related to the US tax return true-up on the sale of the royalty portfolio. In 2006, we recorded an impairment loss of $101 due to the Uzbekistan government expropriation of the Zarafshan operation. In 2007, after pursuing international arbitration, we received proceeds of $80 and recognized a gain of $77 related to the settlement. In 2006, we received $271 net cash proceeds for the Alberta oil sands project, resulting in a $266 gain, received $42 net cash proceeds and approximately 43 million Agincourt shares valued at $37 for the Martabe project, resulting in a $30 gain and received $40 net cash proceeds plus certain royalties for the Holloway assets, resulting in a $13 gain. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax decreased $1,210 in 2008 due to impacts of stock and bond market declines, interest rate reductions and the appreciation of the 59 Table of Contents U.S. dollar. The decrease included non-cash adjustments for a $573 loss in value of marketable securities, a $387 loss on the translation of subsidiaries with non- U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $130 net loss related to pension liability adjustments and a $120 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax increased $284 in 2007 and included non-cash adjustments for a $113 gain in value of marketable securities, a $33 gain related to a pension liability adjustment, and a $138 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax increased $322 in 2006 and included a $272 gain in value of marketable securities, a $47 net gain for unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and a $17 net gain related to a pension liability adjustment, offset by a loss of $14 on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies.

(3) Consolidated gold ounces and copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (4) Economic interest decreased to 45% from 52.875% on May 25, 2007. Consolidated gold ounces sold increased in 2008 from 2007 due to: higher production at Yanacocha due to start-up of milling operations; higher production at Ahafo due to higher ore grades; partially offset by lower production at Batu Hijau due to lower ore grades, throughput and recovery. Consolidated gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to: lower production at Nevada due to lower ore grades; lower production at Yanacocha due to lower ore grade and tons placed on the leach pads; partially offset by a full year of operations at Ahafo and Leeville and Phoenix (Nevada); and higher production at Batu Hijau due to higher ore grades. 60 Table of Contents Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to the mining sequence resulting in lower ore grades, throughput and recovery at Batu Hijau. Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased in 2007 from 2006 as a result of an increase in concentrate inventory at year-end due to the timing of shipments. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher diesel, royalty and labor costs, partially offset by lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau and higher by-product sales. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased labor and diesel costs, the strengthening of the Australian dollar, a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville in Nevada and higher waste removal costs at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower copper production. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased operating costs. We expect 2009 consolidated gold sales of approximately 6.35 to 6.85 million ounces, primarily due to higher production from Australia as a result of the start-up of Boddington and higher production from Batu Hijau as the mining sequence shifts to processing higher ore grades and higher throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2009 are expected to be approximately $400 to $440 per ounce as a result of lower cost ounces from the start-up of Boddington (100%), higher expected sales from Yanacocha and Batu Hijau production, as well as lower oil price and Australian dollar exchange rate assumptions, partially offset by lower by-product credits associated with lower copper price assumptions. We expect 2009 consolidated copper sales of approximately 460 to 510 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per pound as a result of higher expected sales, processing higher grade ore and lower waste removal costs.

(2) Excludes Amortization, Accretion , the 2007 Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and the 2007 Midas redevelopment . Gold ounces sold in Nevada decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to the completion of milling at Lone Tree, lower production at Twin Creeks and reduced ore processing by third parties experiencing operating and financial difficulties, partially offset by higher production from Midas, Leeville and leach pads. Open pit ore mined decreased to 37.4 million tons in 2008, down from 42.6 million tons in 2007, due to mine sequencing at Twin Creeks and Phoenix. Underground ore mined increased to 2.5 million tons in 2008, up from 1.9 million tons in 2007, due to an 80% increase at Leeville. Ore milled decreased to 24.8 million tons from 25.5 million tons in 2007, while mill ore grade decreased 5% due to processing lower grade Twin Creeks stockpiles. Ore placed on leach pads increased to 19.8 million tons in 2008, up from 14.0 million tons in 2007, primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry and the start-up of Bobstar. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2008 compared to 2007 as lower production, increased diesel and other commodity costs, increased underground mining costs, higher royalties and taxes were partially offset by the completion of higher cost Carlin East mining and Lone Tree processing, start-up of the power plant and higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 18% from 2007 due to more production being sourced from Leeville, additional haul trucks at Phoenix and the start-up of the power plant. Gold ounces sold in Nevada decreased in 2007 from 2006 due to the milling of lower grade ore, completion of mining at Lone Tree and the temporary suspension of mining operations at Midas, partially offset by a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville. Open pit ore mined increased to 42.6 million tons in 2007, up from 38.4 million tons in 2006 and underground ore production increased 61 Table of Contents to 1.9 million tons in 2007 from 1.7 million tons in 2006 due to a full year of operations at Phoenix and Leeville. Ore milled increased to 25.5 million tons from 17.9 million tons in 2006, while mill ore grade decreased 23% with the processing of lower grade ore from Phoenix. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 37% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry and Twin Creeks and the completion of mining at Lone Tree in 2006. Processing at the Lone Tree mill continued in 2007 with ore hauled from Twin Creeks. Nevada Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as lower production, higher cost production from Phoenix, the suspension of lower cost mining operations at Midas and increased labor, diesel and commodity costs were partially offset by lower surface mining costs. Surface mining costs were lower due to completion of mining at Lone Tree in 2006 and work on capital projects at Carlin, partially offset by a full year of mining at Phoenix. Amortization per ounce increased 27% from 2006 as a result of a full year of Phoenix and Leeville operation. Our Midas operation in Nevada was suspended from June to October 2007 after a fatal accident. Mining activities ramped-up and returned to historic production levels during 2008. Consolidated gold sales are expected to decline in 2009 to approximately 1.8 to 2.0 million ounces, primarily due to lower expected ore grades, fewer expected oxide leach pad additions, the continued suspension of a third-party operated processing facility and lower recoveries at Mill 6 and the completion of underground mining activities at Deep Post by the end of 2009. Costs applicable to sales in 2009 are expected to be approximately $535 to $575 per ounce, primarily due to lower production and lower by-product credits from Phoenix copper sales, partially offset by lower diesel costs and a full-year of power provided from our power plant completed in mid-2008.

Consolidated gold ounces sold at Yanacocha increased in 2008 from 2007 due to the start-up of milling operations, partially offset by lower leach production. Ore placed on the leach pads decreased to 97.8 million tons in 2008 from 98.3 million tons in 2007 while leach ore grades decreased 5% to 0.018 ounces per ton. Gold production increased by 16% primarily due to 304,200 ounces from the new mill. Start up of the mill occurred in late March and commercial production was achieved in the second quarter of 2008. Costs applicable to sales increased $33 per ounce in 2008 due to higher diesel and commodity costs and higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices, partially offset by higher gold production and higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce decreased 11% from 2007 as a result of higher gold production partially offset by amortization of the new mill. Consolidated gold ounces sold at Yanacocha decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to fewer ore tons and lower grade ore placed on the leach pads. Ore mined decreased to 98.6 million tons in 2007 from 115.8 million tons in 2006. Ore grade decreased by 27% in 2007 compared to 2006 due to mine sequencing. The proportion of waste mined increased from 0.9 to 1.1 waste tons per ton of ore in 2007 compared to 2006 as expected in the mine plan. Costs applicable to sales increased $152 per ounce in 2007 primarily due to lower production, which impacted unit costs by approximately $125 per ounce, as well as increased labor, diesel, mine maintenance and other costs, partially offset by lower royalties and workers participation costs. 62 Table of Contents Consolidated gold sales are expected to increase in 2009 to approximately 1.9 to 2.0 million ounces, primarily from a full year of mill operation. Costs applicable to sales at Yanacocha are expected to decrease in 2009 to approximately $290 to $310 per ounce, primarily due to increased sales, lower expected diesel costs and increased silver by-product credits from a full year of mill operation. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Yanacocha recorded $18, $10 and $22 to Other expense, net , respectively, related to an agreement with the Peruvian government to provide for a royalty payment for community improvements. The negotiated royalty is based on 3.75% of Yanacocha net income beginning January 1, 2006 for a period of up to five years. In May 2007, a new Collective Bargaining Agreement expiring in February 2010 was completed.

Australia/New Zealand gold ounces sold increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher production at Jundee and Waihi, partially offset by lower production at Tanami. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to increased input costs, particularly diesel, electricity and labor, and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, partially offset by lower administrative costs. During 2008, a portion of the Australian and New Zealand dollar denominated operating expenditures were hedged which increased Costs applicable to sales by $14, or $12 per ounce due to the sharp weakness in the Australian and New Zealand dollars experienced late in the year. Amortization per ounce increased 10% due to an increase in underground mine development at Tanami, Jundee and Waihi. Australia/New Zealand gold ounces sold decreased slightly in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of lower production at Kalgoorlie, Jundee and Waihi, partially offset by increased inventory sales. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the strengthening of the Australian and New Zealand dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $40 per ounce, increased royalties due to the higher gold price and increased diesel, electricity and labor costs. Consolidated gold sales are expected to increase in 2009 to approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million ounces, primarily as a result of start-up of Boddington project (100%) in mid-2009. Costs applicable to sales are expected to decrease to approximately $440 to $480 per ounce in 2009, primarily driven by the start-up of Boddington, lower costs at the Kalgoorlie operation, lower diesel price and lower Australian dollar exchange rate assumptions. Jundee, Australia. Gold ounces sold increased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to higher grade and a change in the mining sequence resulting in additional high grade ore mined from Westside, partially offset by lower mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 15%, attributable to higher production and lower milling costs, partially offset by higher fuel and power costs, and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $13 per ounce. 63 Table of Contents Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of lower production, partially offset by inventory sales. Mill throughput decreased 26% due to the consolidation of milling operations into one plant, partially offset by 28% higher mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the stronger Australian dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $42 per ounce, lower production, and higher underground mining and power costs. Tanami, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to a 15% decrease in mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 46%, due to lower production, higher contracted services costs, higher milling costs and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $20 per ounce. Gold ounces sold increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of inventory sales. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $29 per ounce, increased underground mining and milling costs due to being in a deeper part of the mine which results in increased backfill activity and fuel and labor costs, partially offset by lower royalties. Kalgoorlie, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a draw-down of gold inventories in 2007, not repeated in 2008. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 29%, due to lower production, higher fuel costs, additional leased trucks, higher waste tons mined and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $23 per ounce, partially offset by lower milling and administrative costs. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of a 13% decrease in ore grade milled, partially offset by inventory sales. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $51 per ounce, lower production and higher mining costs. Mining costs were higher primarily due to increased sound abatement, contract maintenance, drilling, fuel and tire costs. Waihi, New Zealand. Gold ounces sold increased in 2008 from 2007, due to significantly higher mill throughput as mill maintenance was completed in the first quarter of 2007, and milling more Favona underground ore partially offset by 12% lower mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were 14% lower due to higher production and higher by-product credits. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of the transition to mining the Martha open pit south layback and Favona underground in 2007. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of the strengthening of the New Zealand dollar which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $51 per ounce and lower production. Development of the Boddington project remains on schedule and was approximately 89% complete as of December 31, 2008 with initial mill start up expected in mid-2009. The expected capital cost for the project is between $2,600 and $2,900 on a 100% basis. In 2007, the Company commenced a hedging program to reduce the variability of the Australian denominated capital expenditures related to Boddington. As of December 31, 2008, we have hedged 83% of our 66.67% ownership forecasted Australian denominated capital expenditures at Boddington in 2009. 64 Table of Contents Batu Hijau Operations Gold Ounces or Copper Pounds Sold Costs Applicable to Sales (1) Amortization 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (ounces in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Gold Batu Hijau (2)(3) 299 494 435 $ 414 $ 232 $ 197 $ 85 $ 50 $ 46 (pounds in millions) ($ per pound) ($ per pound) Copper Batu Hijau (2)(3) 290 428 435 $ 1.38 $ 1.05 $ 0.67 $ 0.28 $ 0.22 $ 0.15 (1) Excludes Amortization , Accretion and the 2007 Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts . (2) Consolidated gold ounces and copper pounds sold includes minority interests share. (3) Economic interest decreased to 45% from 52.875% on May 25, 2007. Consolidated copper pounds and gold ounces sold at Batu Hijau decreased in 2008 from 2007 due to lower throughput, ore grade and recovery. Batu Hijau experienced heavy rainfall during the first quarter of 2008 causing minor damage to pit infrastructure, as well as adding significant amounts of water to the pit, delaying planned access to higher grade Phase 4 ore in the bottom of the pit until late in the third quarter of 2008. Mill throughput was 19% lower in 2008 compared to 2007 due to processing harder ores and blending limitations as a majority of 2008 ore was sourced from stockpiles and Phase 5 ore. Ore processed during 2008 was lower in grade and contributed to lower recovery than ores processed in 2007. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased in 2008, compared to 2007, as a result of higher mining costs due to increased diesel, labor and milling costs, partially offset by lower waste tons mined. Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold also increased as a higher co-product allocation of costs was made to gold as a result of higher gold prices and lower copper prices. Amortization per pound of copper and ounce of gold increased due to lower production. Consolidated copper sales decreased slightly in 2007 from 2006, due to increased year-end concentrate inventories, partially offset by 7% higher production. Consolidated gold sales increased in 2007 from 2006 due to 22% higher production, partially offset by increased year-end concentrate inventories. Increased mill throughput from an improved grinding circuit control system was offset by extended mill downtime in the fourth quarter of 2007 to repair a damaged mill motor. Copper production increased due to a 9% increase in ore grade, partially offset by slightly lower recoveries. Gold production increased due to a 17% increase in ore grade and a 3% increase in recovery. Concentrate inventories increased due to the timing of shipments. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the significant processing of ore from stockpiles and higher proportion of waste tons mined. The ratio of waste tons to ore tons increased from 1.3 in 2006 to 7.3 in 2007. In 2007, most of the mining occurred with Phase 5 waste removal to prepare this phase for future production, while 2006 mining occurred substantially in Phase 4 ore. Costs applicable to sales also increased due to higher labor and maintenance costs and regional taxes. The average realized net copper price decreased to $2.59 per pound in 2008 from $2.86 per pound in 2007. As of December 31, 2008 Batu Hijau had copper sales of 82 million pounds priced at an average of $1.39 per pound subject to final pricing compared to 113 million pounds priced at an average of $3.02 per pound at December 31, 2007. The final copper collar contract deliveries were made in February 2007. Consolidated sales are expected to increase in 2009 to approximately 500,000 to 555,000 ounces of gold and approximately 460 to 510 million pounds of copper as mining shifts into the higher grade Phase 5 ore. Costs applicable to sales are expected to decrease in 2009 to approximately $240 to $260 per ounce of gold and approximately $0.65 to $0.75 per pound of copper, primarily driven by 65 Table of Contents higher expected sales, the processing of higher grade ore compared to the lower grade stockpiles processed during 2008, and lower waste removal. We currently have a 45% ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine, held through the Nusa Tenggara Partnership ( NTP ) with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan. We have a 56.25% interest in NTP and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ), the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. We identified NTP as a VIE as a result of certain capital structures and contractual relationships and have fully consolidated NTP in the consolidated financial statements since January 1, 2004. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T. Pukuafu Indah ( PTPI ), an unrelated Indonesian company. Under the Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT shares must be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares would be accepted for listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. Pursuant to this provision, it is possible that the ownership interest of NTP in PTNNT could be reduced to 49%. PTPI has owned and continues to own a 20% interest in PTNNT, and therefore NTP was required to offer a 3% interest in PTNNT for sale in 2006 and an additional 7% interest in each of 2007 and 2008. In accordance with the Contract of Work, an offer to sell a 3% interest was made to the Indonesian government in 2006 and an offer for an additional 7% interest was made in each of 2007 and 2008. While the central government declined to participate in the 2006 and 2007 offers, local governments in the area in which the Batu Hijau mine is located have expressed interest in acquiring shares, as have various Indonesian nationals and companies. In January 2008, NTP agreed to sell, under a carried interest arrangement, 2% of PTNNT shares to Kabupaten Sumbawa, one of the local governments, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. The Indonesian government subsequently stated that it would not approve the transfer of shares under this agreement. On February 11, 2008, PTNNT received notification from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources ( DEMR ) alleging that PTNNT is in breach of its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatening to issue a notice to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest the 2006 and 2007 shares, in accordance with the direction of the DEMR, by February 22, 2008, which date was extended to March 3, 2008. A second Notice of Default was received relating to the alleged failure to divest the 2008 shares. On March 3, 2008, the Indonesian government filed for international arbitration, as did PTNNT, as provided under the Contract of Work. In the arbitration proceeding, PTNNT seeks a declaration that the Indonesian government is not entitled to terminate the Contract of Work and additional declarations pertaining to the procedures for divesting the shares. For its part, the Indonesian government seeks declarations that PTNNT is in default of its divestiture obligations, that the Government may terminate the Contract of Work, and that PTNNT must cause shares subject to divestiture to be sold to certain local governments. An international arbitration panel was appointed and an arbitration hearing was held in Jakarta in December 2008. We anticipate a ruling will be issued in the first half of 2009. Newmont and Sumitomo believe there is no basis under the Contract of Work for the notifications and no grounds for terminating the Contract of Work, and PTNNT is vigorously defending the matter. In 1997, to enable development of the Batu Hijau mine, PTNNT secured an aggregate $1,000 in financing from the United States Export-Import Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (formerly the Japan Export-Import Bank), and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (the German Export-Import Bank) (collectively, the Senior Lenders ). The Senior Lenders required the shareholders of PTNNT to pledge 100% of the shares of PTNNT as security for repayment of the loans. As part of 66 Table of Contents that process, on October 30, 1997, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources approved the share pledge arrangements. Subsequent to an additional 7% interest in PTNNT being offered by NTP for sale on March 28, 2008 (as required under the Contract of Work), the Director General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Resources at DEMR claimed that PTNNT breached its obligations under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be offered for sale that are pledged to the Senior Lenders as security for the repayment of the senior debt. In the letter, the Director General claimed that NTP would be in default under the Contract of Work if the shares of PTNNT offered for sale in March 2008, together with the shares offered in 2006 and 2007, were not in the possession of Indonesian government and/or government owned entities, free of any such senior pledge, by July 13, 2008. Consequently, on July 10, 2008, PTNNT filed a notice to commence an additional international arbitration proceeding, as provided for under the Contract of Work, to resolve the claim that PTNNT breached its obligations under the Contract of Work by allowing shares to be offered that are subject to pledge obligations to the Senior Lenders. This pledge of shares issue has since been incorporated into, and will be resolved as part of the initial arbitration proceeding. In addition, we have, through PTNNT, been in discussions to extend our forest use permit (called a Pinjam Pakai ) for over three years. In 2005, Indonesian governmental authorities reviewed the contractual requirements for extension of the Pinjam Pakai and determined that PTNNT met those requirements. This permit is a key requirement to continue to operate Batu Hijau efficiently, in addition to the ultimate life of the mine and recoverability of reserves. However, the permit extension has not been received as of the date of this Annual Report. The resulting delay has adversely impacted Batu Hijau, and may adversely impact future operating and financial results, including deferment or cancellation of future mine development and operations. For more information on the results of the Batu Hijau operations, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Africa Operations Gold Ounces Sold (1) Costs Applicable to Sales (2) Amortization 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Ahafo 521 446 202 $ 408 $ 376 $ 257 $ 126 $ 96 $ 94 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 19 in 2008. (2) Excludes Amortization , Accretion and the 2007 Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts . Gold ounces sold at Ahafo increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 25% increase in mill ore grade and higher throughput, partially offset by an increase in in-process inventory. Total tons mined increased to 50.6 million tons in 2008 from 44.2 million tons in 2007, due to equipment additions, increased mining efficiencies and the operation of a third pit. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to higher diesel, power, royalties, maintenance and contract services costs, partially offset by higher production. Amortization per ounce increased due to the use of additional equipment and the operation of a third pit. Gold ounces sold at Ahafo increased in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of a full year of production in 2007. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased due to higher mining and milling costs. Mining costs increased primarily due to higher waste removal in the Apensu pit, higher fuel, pit dewatering and maintenance costs. Milling costs increased due to higher electricity and maintenance costs. Costs applicable to sales in 2006 also benefited from the capitalization of pre-production costs. Consolidated gold sales are expected to remain constant at approximately 500,000 to 525,000 ounces in 2009. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $450 to $475 per ounce is expected for 2009, primarily as a result of higher labor costs, a lower benefit from the capitalization of waste material used in the construction of assets, and higher fuel consumption. 67 Table of Contents During 2007, Newmont and other gold companies with production in Ghana, formed a consortium to import power generation equipment and constructed an 80 mega-watt power plant. The plant was commissioned in 2008 and is ready for transfer to the Volta River Authority. As a result of the mining industry initiative to install the power plant, the Ghanaian government has agreed, if required to curtail power consumption as a result of power shortages, to distribute power proportionately between participating mines and other industrial and commercial customers.

(2) Consolidated gold ounces sold includes minority interests share. Gold ounces sold at Other Operations decreased in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to no sales from Golden Giant, partially offset by higher ore placement on the leach pads at La Herradura. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to an $18 (or $205 per ounce) impairment to net realizable value on leach pads at Kori Kollo, additional royalties, higher fuel and leaching costs at Kori Kollo as well as increased waste removal and higher fuel costs at La Herradura. Gold ounces sold at Other Operations decreased in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to the completion of operations at Golden Giant and lower production from Kori Kollo. Gold production from Kori Kollo decreased due to lower recovery from the leach pads. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to lower production and higher waste removal costs at La Herradura and the completion of operations at Golden Giant. Consolidated gold sales for Other Operations in 2009 are expected to be approximately 150,000 to 170,000 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $465 to $480 per ounce. Exploration Exploration expense was $214, $177 and $166 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Exploration expense in 2008 reflects increased activity in response to higher gold prices and increased drilling, labor and consumable costs. We anticipate spending between $165 and $175 on exploration activities in 2009 due to a reduced drilling program related to the Company focus on net cash flow generation and a more selective and strategic exploration program. During 2008, we added 5.2 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.7 million equity ounces of depletion. Reserve additions from exploration of 4.4 million equity ounces were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Boddington (1.6 million equity ounces, 66.67%), with most of the remaining additions coming from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada (totaling 1.2 million equity ounces) and from underground sites in Australia (0.7 million equity ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 1.1 million equity ounces, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts at Phoenix in Nevada. The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was an increase of 1.9 million equity ounces. 68 Table of Contents During 2007, reserve additions from exploration of 3.5 million equity ounces were primarily due to further extension drilling at Boddington (66.67%), Jundee and Tanami in Australia (2.6 million equity ounces), with the remaining additions from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada as well as La Herradura in Mexico. We added a total of 0.8 million equity gold ounces to proven and probable reserves in 2007. Exploration activities during 2006 succeeded in converting significant new reserves at Carlin open pits (2.3 million equity gold ounces), Boddington (1.4 million equity gold ounces, 66.67%), Twin Creeks (1.1 million equity gold ounces), Ahafo (0.7 million equity gold ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million equity gold ounces), and Kalgoorlie (0.6 million equity gold ounces). We added a total of 5.9 million equity gold ounces to proven and probable reserves in 2006. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates In addition to its domestic operations in the United States, we have operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, Bolivia and other foreign locations. Our operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 28%, 28% and 33% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations increased Costs applicable to sales $13 in 2008 from 2007, and $51 in 2007 from 2006, primarily by movements in the Australian dollar. In 2007, we implemented derivative programs to hedge up to 75% of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating and capital expenditures to reduce the variability in our Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2008, we have hedged 66%, 38% and 12% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, at an average rate of 0.79, 0.78 and 0.74, respectively. We have also hedged 83% of our 66.67% ownership forecasted Australian denominated capital expenditures at Boddington in 2009 at an average rate of 0.79. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. 69 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Post-Retirement Benefit Plan In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assets ( FSP FAS 132(R)-1 ), which amends FASB Statement No. 132 Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits ( FAS 132 ), to provide guidance on an employer disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plan. The objective of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is to require more detailed disclosures about employers plan assets, including employers investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. Upon initial application, the provisions of this FSP are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this statement on our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plan disclosures. Equity Method Investment In November 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 08-6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations ( EITF 08-6 ), which clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. The intent of EITF 08-6 is to provide guidance on (i) determining the initial carrying value of an equity method investment, (ii) performing an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset of an equity method investment, (iii) accounting for an equity method investee issuance of shares, and (iv) accounting for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method. EITF 08-6 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this statement on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Equity-Linked Financial Instruments In June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity Own Stock ( EITF 07-5 ). EITF 07-5 clarifies the determination of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity own stock, which would qualify as a scope exception under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( FAS 133 ). EITF 07-5 is effective for our fiscal years beginning January 1, 2009. Early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 07-5 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ( FSP APB 14-1 ). FSP APB 14-1 applies to convertible debt instruments that, by their stated terms, may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under FAS 133. Convertible debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB 14-1 are not addressed by the existing APB 14. FSP APB 14-1 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of FSP APB 14-1 be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the entity nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component will be reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument expected life using the effective interest method. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for our 70 Table of Contents fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We estimate that approximately $301 of debt discount will be recorded and the effective interest rate on our 2014 and 2017 convertible senior notes (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) will increase by approximately 5 percentage points to 6.0% and 6.25%, respectively, for the non-cash amortization of the debt discount. If FSP APB 14-1 had been effective when the convertible debt instruments were issued, Net income would have been $21 ($0.05 per share) lower in 2008 and Net loss would have been $9 ($0.02 per share) higher in 2007. Accounting for the Useful Life of Intangible Assets In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets ( FSP 142-3 ) which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( FAS 142 ). The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations ( FAS 141 ). FSP 142-3 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. We do not expect the adoption of FSP 142-3 to have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Derivative Instruments In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ( FAS 161 ) which provides revised guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this statement on our derivative instrument disclosures. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations ( FAS 141(R) ) which amends FAS 141, and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141(R) is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and is to be applied prospectively. This statement will impact how we account for future business combinations and our future consolidated financial position and results of operations. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( FAS 160 ) which establishes accounting and reporting standards pertaining to (i) ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, (ii) the amount of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, (iii) changes in a parent ownership interest, and (iv) the valuation of any retained noncontrolling equity investment when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. For presentation and disclosure purposes, FAS 160 requires noncontrolling interests to be classified as a separate component of stockholders equity. FAS 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. 71 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided from Operating Activities Net cash provided from continuing operations was $1,403, $525 and $1,129 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and was significantly impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) (1) 6,255 6,184 7,186 Average price received per ounce of gold (2) $ 874 $ 697 $ 594 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold sold (3) $ 440 $ 389 $ 288 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 290 428 435 Average price received per pound of copper (2) $ 2.59 $ 2.86 $ 1.54 Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper sold (3) $ 1.38 $ 1.05 $ 0.67 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 20, 6 and 100 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Incremental start-up includes the removal and production of de minimis saleable materials during development and is recorded as Other income , net of incremental mining and processing costs. (2) After treatment and refining charges and excluding settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. (3) Excludes Amortization , Accretion , the 2007 Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and the 2007 Midas redevelopment . Net cash provided from continuing operations increased $878 compared to 2007. Cash flow provided from operations during 2008 was impacted by significantly higher realized gold prices and increased gold sales volume, partially offset by lower realized copper prices and lower copper sales volume, as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results , and $354 invested in inventories, stockpiles (primarily at Batu Hijau) and ore on leach pads, $198 invested in prepaid taxes and $104 to fund reclamation activities. The 2007 results were negatively impacted by the $578 settlement of the price-capped forward sales contracts, $276 payment of pre-acquisition Australia income taxes of Normandy and $174 from the final settlement of copper collar contracts. We are currently planning to contribute $48 to our retirement benefit programs in 2009 to bolster plan assets which were impacted by the sharp decline in values in 2008. For additional discussion see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $2,151, $2,467 and $1,142 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additions to property, plant and mine development were $1,875, $1,672 and $1,537 for continuing operations in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 72 Table of Contents Additions to property, plant and mine development were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Nevada, USA $ 337 $ 588 $ 705 Yanacocha, Peru 239 253 269 Australia/New Zealand: Jundee, Australia 37 41 23 Tanami, Australia 49 41 31 Kalgoorlie, Australia 14 5 14 Waihi, New Zealand 27 39 28 Boddington, Australia 833 468 93 Other, Australia 2 5 3 962 599 192 Batu Hijau, Indonesia 84 74 106 Africa: Ahafo, Ghana 115 114 177 Akyem, Ghana 2 20 57 117 134 234 Hope Bay, Canada 82 Other Operations: Kori Kollo, Bolivia 5 3 1 La Herradura, Mexico 28 10 10 33 13 11 Corporate and Other 21 11 20 $ 1,875 $ 1,672 $ 1,537 Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2008 included $40 for completion of the power plant, $73 for surface and underground development, $55 for tailings dams and $19 for mine equipment. Yanacocha capital expenditures included $35 for completion of the gold mill, $61 for leach pad expansions and $34 for the Conga project. Capital expenditures in Australia/New Zealand included $833 for continued construction of the Boddington project and $59 for underground mine development. In 2007, we commenced a hedging program to reduce the variability of the Australian denominated capital expenditures related to Boddington. As of December 31, 2008, we have hedged 83% of our remaining forecasted Australian dollar denominated capital expenditures in 2009 for our 66.67% ownership at an average rate of 0.79. Batu Hijau capital expenditures included $42 for a tailings pipeline, $16 for mine equipment purchases and $14 for mine dewatering. Capital expenditures in Africa included $34 for surface development, $28 for mine equipment purchases and $22 for infrastructure and land. Hope Bay expenditures included $79 for project infrastructure. Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2007 included $280 for the power plant and $160 for mine equipment replacement. Yanacocha capital expenditures included $139 for construction of the gold mill, $39 for leach pad expansions and $12 for the Conga project. Capital expenditures in Australia/New Zealand included $468 for construction of the Boddington project, $63 for underground mine development and $27 for tailings dams construction. Batu Hijau capital expenditures included $38 for mine equipment purchases and $17 for mine dewatering. Capital expenditures in Africa included $20 at Akyem and $14 for power generation facilities, $21 for a cyanide recovery circuit, $28 for mine equipment and $12 for infrastructure and land at Ahafo. 73 Table of Contents Capital expenditures in Nevada during 2006 included $239 for the power plant, $160 for surface mining equipment, $104 for the development of the Leeville underground mine, $87 for the development of the Phoenix project, and $54 for tailings dams and leach pads. Yanacocha capital expenditures included $113 for development and leach pad expansions, $44 for the gold mill project, $43 for mine maintenance and services, and $11 for the Conga project. Australian capital expenditures included $93 for the Boddington project and $71 for mine development. Expenditures at Batu Hijau included $67 for the purchase of additional mining equipment and $20 for process improvements and replacement of the tailings line. Capital expenditures in Africa included $117 for project completion and $24 for mining equipment at Ahafo and $57 for engineering and procurement expenditures for process facilities and other pre-construction activities at Akyem. Corporate expenditures primarily included information technology systems. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, $18, $19 and $21, respectively, of drilling and related costs were capitalized and included in mine development costs. These capitalized costs included $10 at Australia, $6 at Nevada and $2 at La Herradura in 2008; $11 at Australia, $4 at Nevada, $2 at La Herradura and $1 at Africa and Yanacocha in 2007; and $10 at Australia, $7 at Nevada, $3 at Africa, and $1 at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau in 2006. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, $27, $16 and $48, respectively, of pre-stripping costs were capitalized and included in mine development costs. Pre-stripping costs included the Bobstar pit and North Lantern pit in Nevada and the Awonsu and Amoma pits at Ahafo in 2008, the Bobstar pit in Nevada in 2007 and the Phoenix mine in Nevada, the Chaquicocha mine at Yanacocha, and the Subika and Apensu pits at Ahafo in 2006. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,400 to $1,600 in 2009, with approximately 60% in Australia/New Zealand, 15% in Nevada and the remaining 25% at other locations. Approximately 45% of the 2009 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 55% allocated to project development initiatives, including completion of the Boddington project (100%) in Australia. Investments in marketable debt and equity securities, net. We had net proceeds of $nil, $2 and $774 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, from auction rate marketable debt securities. The auction rate marketable debt securities in which we have invested have not traded in an active market since August 2007 and there are currently no market quotations available. The investment carries a BBB rating from both Standard and Poor and Fitch s. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $7 of such securities, with accumulated unrealized losses of approximately $2, are classified as long-term marketable debt securities as a result of current auction market conditions and our expectation of holding such investments to maturity or recovery which is likely longer than one year. Similarly, we anticipate holding our marketable debt securities investment in asset backed commercial paper, which we obtained through the acquisition of Miramar, to maturity or recovery which is likely longer than one year. During 2008, we purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $11 and other marketable equity securities for $6 and we received cash of $50 for the sale of marketable equity securities. During 2007, we purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $27 and other marketable equity securities for $9. During 2006, we purchased marketable equity securities of Gabriel Resources for $17 and Queenstake Resources for $10. We also reinvested dividends from Canadian Oil Sands Trust for $26. Acquisitions. During the last quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, we paid $953 and $318, respectively, to acquire the remaining outstanding common shares of Miramar, resulting in Miramar becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result of the completed acquisition of Miramar, we control the Hope Bay project, a large undeveloped gold property in Nunavut, Canada. In April 2008, we purchased additional shares of EGR for $7, net of cash acquired, bringing our ownership interest to 56.67% from 46.72%. In November 2008, EGR repurchased 6.55% of its own shares from a minority shareholder bringing our ownership to 60.64%. 74 Table of Contents In September 2006, we acquired a 40% interest in Shore Gold Inc. Fort a la Corne JV diamond project in Saskatchewan, Canada. In March 2006, we acquired Newcrest Mining Limited 22.22% interest in the Boddington project, bringing our interest in the project to 66.67%, for total consideration of $173. In January 2006, we acquired the remaining 15% interest in the Akyem project in Ghana for $23, bringing our interest to 100%. Development studies on Akyem continued through 2008. A development decision is pending resolution of power availability in Ghana and further project optimization. We are advancing towards a development decision in 2010 based on Ghana proactive stance towards power development. Financing Activities Net cash provided from (used in) financing activities of continuing operations was $123 in 2008, compared to $465 and $(333) in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from debt, net. During 2008, we received net proceeds of $757 under our $2,000 revolving credit facility compared to net proceeds of $nil in 2007 and 2006. The facility is also used for the issuance of letters of credit totaling $519 as of December 31, 2008, primarily supporting reclamation obligations (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below). We also had proceeds of $75 in December at Ahafo from an International Finance Corporation loan. During July 2007, we completed a private offering of $1,150 convertible senior notes due 2014 and 2017, each in the amount of $575. The 2014 notes, maturing on July 15, 2014, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.25% per annum, and the 2017 notes, maturing on July 15, 2017, pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 1.625% per annum. The notes will be convertible, at the holder option, at a conversion price of $46.21 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, the principle amount and all accrued interest will be repaid in cash and any conversion premium will be settled in shares of our common stock or, at our election, cash or any combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We are not entitled to redeem the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. The net proceeds from the offering, after expenses, were approximately $1,126. We used the net proceeds of the offering to (i) pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into with affiliates of some of the initial purchasers, (ii) repay outstanding indebtedness under our senior revolving credit facility, (iii) net settle our price-capped forward sales contracts, (iv) fund capital expenditures for Boddington and the power plant in Nevada and (v) fund other general corporate purposes. In connection with the convertible senior notes offering, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions ( Call Spread Transactions ). These transactions included the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants. As a result of the Call Spread Transactions, the conversion price of $46.21 was effectively increased to $60.27. Our aggregate cost of the purchased call options was $366, partially offset by $248 that we received from the sale of the warrants. In July 2006, Yanacocha issued $100 of bonds in the Peruvian capital markets under a $200 bond program approved by the Peruvian securities regulatory authority. The bonds are comprised of $42 of floating interest rate bonds bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.4375%; and $58 of fixed rate bonds bearing interest at 7.0%. The bonds have a four year grace repayment period and amortize quarterly over six years. The bonds are uncollateralized and are non-recourse to us. Funds generated from the bond issuance were used by Yanacocha primarily for capital expenditures. In May 2006, Yanacocha entered into an uncollateralized $100 bank financing with a syndicate of Peruvian commercial banks. Quarterly repayments began May 2007 with final maturity May 2014. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.875%. The loan is uncollateralized and non-recourse to us. 75 Table of Contents Repayment of debt. During 2008, we made scheduled debt repayments of $119 on maturity of the Australia 7 5 / 8 % notes, $22 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant, classified as a capital lease, $87 related to Batu Hijau project financing, $14 on the Yanacocha credit facility and $11 on Yanacocha capital leases. Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $169 in 2009, $156 in 2010, $329 in 2011, $901 in 2012, $115 in 2013 and $1,872 thereafter. Dividends paid to minority interests. We paid dividends of $389, $270 and $264 to minority interests during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Dividends paid to common stockholders. We paid annual dividends of $0.40 per common share during 2008, 2007 and 2006. Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, paid annual dividends of C$0.43, C$0.43 and C$0.46 during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On February 18, 2009, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, payable March 27, 2009 to holders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2009. The total paid to common stockholders was $182, $181 and $180 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from stock issuance. We received proceeds of $29, $51 and $78 during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options. Early extinguishment of prepaid forward sales obligation. In September 2006, we settled our remaining obligations under the prepaid forward gold sales contract and forward gold purchase contract for which we were required to deliver gold in December 2006 and June 2007. This settlement resulted in cash payments of approximately $96 and a $48 reduction to the current portion of long-term debt. Discontinued Operations Net operating cash (used in) provided from discontinued operations was $(111) in 2008, compared to $138 and $96 in 2007 and 2006, respectively, as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Royalty portfolio $ (111 ) $ 90 $ 74 Pajingo 48 34 Zarafshan 10 Holloway (22 ) $ (111 ) $ 138 $ 96 During 2008 we made tax payments of $153 related to the December 2007 royalty portfolio sale, had income from discontinued operations of $24 and net changes to operating liabilities and assets of $18. Net cash (used in) provided from investing activities of discontinued operations was $(6), $1,354 and $338 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Proceeds from asset sales, net $ (6 ) $ 1,197 $ 353 Additions to property, plant and mine development (6 ) (20 ) Zarafshan-Newmont Joint Venture settlement, net 77 Marketable securities and other investments, net 88 (2 ) Other (2 ) 7 $ (6 ) $ 1,354 $ 338 76 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2008 included accrued expense payments on the royalty portfolio sale of $11, partially offset by $5 in proceeds from the sale of assets at Pajingo. Proceeds from the sale of assets in 2007 included $1,187 from the sale of the royalty portfolio and $10 from the sale of the Pajingo operation. Proceeds from the sale of assets in 2006 included $271 proceeds from the sale of the Alberta oil sands project and $82 on the sales of the Martabe project and the Holloway operation. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations was $nil in 2008 and 2007 and $7 in 2006 from the repayment of debt at Zarafshan. Corporate Revolving Credit Facility The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the lead bank prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the facility fees were 0.07% of the commitment. There was $519 and $440 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 we had $724 of the credit facility borrowings available. Debt Covenants The 5 7 / 8 % notes, 8 5 / 8 % debentures, and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring us to maintain a net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring us to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets. Certain of our project debt facilities contain debt covenants and default provisions including limitations on dividends subject to certain debt service cover ratios, limitations on sales of assets, negative pledges on certain assets, restricted payments to partners, change of control provisions and limitations of additional permitted debt. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults. Shelf Registration Statement In October 2007, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common 77 Table of Contents stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 4-5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Debt (1) $ 4,369 $ 213 $ 1,435 $ 775 $ 1,946 Capital lease obligations (1) 297 52 163 73 9 Remediation and reclamation obligations (2) 1,352 68 195 118 971 Employee-related benefits (3) 231 70 87 40 34 FIN 48 liability and interest (4) 167 167 Operating leases 99 12 34 17 36 Minimum royalty payments 187 19 56 38 74 Purchase obligations (5) 198 49 59 36 54 Other (6) 1,067 406 623 35 3 $ 7,967 $ 889 $ 2,652 $ 1,132 $ 3,294 (1) Amounts represent principal ($3,541) and estimated interest payments ($1,125) assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2013 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (4) As of December 31, 2008, our FIN 48 liability and FIN 48 interest payable were $130 and $37, respectively. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our FIN 48 liability and interest payments beyond 2009 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. (5) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (6) Other contractual obligations that are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements include labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $778 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We also provide a contingent support line of credit to PTNNT of which our pro rata share is $37. In 2008, $23 was provided under this contingent support agreement. 78 Table of Contents Batu Hijau has sales agreements to sell copper concentrates at market prices as follows (in thousands of tons) 803 in 2009; 823 in 2010; 670 in 2011, 651 in 2012, 639 in 2013 and 231 thereafter. For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Future Cash Flows We anticipate that significant capital expenditures in future years (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and minority interests is expected to lead to Net cash used in investing activities and Net cash used in financing activities exceeding Net cash provided by operating activities . Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In light of the currently limited global availability of credit, and given our existing debt position, we may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 3, 2009, we completed a public offering of $518 convertible senior notes, including notes offered to cover over-allotments, maturing on February 15, 2012 for net proceeds of $504 after deducting the underwriters discount and estimated expenses of the offering. The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.00% per annum. The notes are convertible, at the holder option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock. On February 3, 2009, we completed a public offering of 34,500,000 shares of common stock, including shares offered to cover over-allotments, at a price of $37.00, for net proceeds of $1,233 after deducting the underwriters discount and estimated expenses of the offering. Such offerings were made pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3. See Shelf Registration Statement above. The following table represents our pro-forma capitalization assuming the completion of the public offerings of the convertible senior notes and common stock noted above as well as the impact of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1. FSP APB 14-1 applies to convertible debt instruments and requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the entity nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. This requires an allocation of the convertible debt proceeds between the liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component). The difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component will be reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings over the instrument expected life using the 79 Table of Contents effective interest method. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Total Capitalization as of December 31, 2008 Pro-Forma Pro-Forma Actual Adjustments Balance Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and other short-term instruments $ 447 $ 1,737 $ 2,184 Long-term debt, including current portion: 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 $ $ 444 $ 444 1.250% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 575 (127 ) 448 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 575 (174 ) 401 Other debt 2,390 2,390 Total long-term debt $ 3,540 $ 143 $ 3,683 Stockholders equity: Common stock $ 709 $ 55 $ 764 Additional paid-in capital 6,639 1,444 8,083 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (253 ) (253 ) Retained earnings (deficit) 7 (30 ) (23 ) Total stockholders equity $ 7,102 $ 1,469 $ 8,571 Total capitalization $ 10,642 $ 1,612 $ 12,254 Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized spot price of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided by operating activities to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of Costs applicable to sales in Australia/New Zealand. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided from operating activities to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Net cash provided from operating activities will also be impacted in 2009 as a result of planned contributions of $48 for our post-retirement benefit programs. Based on our production profile as of December 31, 2008, we expect that consolidated gold ounces sold will be between 6.35 and 6.85 million ounces in 2009. We do not anticipate that reasonably expected variations in gold or copper sales alone will influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2009. Environmental Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, $617 and $569, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to 80 Table of Contents currently or recently producing mineral properties, of which $49 is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in 2009. In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. We believe that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $163 and $125 were accrued for such obligations as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, we believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 126% greater or 7% lower than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2008. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Other expense, net in the period estimates are revised. We spent $39, $13 and $12 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $15 as a current liability expected to be spent in 2009. Expenditures for 2008 related primarily to Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado as well as the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia which is a legacy Normandy site. Expenditures for 2007 and 2006 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in Nevada and the Dawn mill site. Included in capital expenditures were $231, $90 and $124 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . Included in Other long-term assets is $23 of restricted cash that is legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to Hope Bay and former Miramar operations and $13 related to commitments in Peru. For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
