Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. We acquired Ocular on January 6, 2005 and include Ocular in our results from that date. Therefore, on a comparative basis, our results of operations include twelve months of Ocular in fiscal 2006 and ten months in fiscal 2005. We began recording share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective transition method whereby prior periods are not restated and do not include such expense. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. 2006 Compared with 2005 Outlook We believe that CVI will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical, PC Technology and specialty contact lenses. In the U.S., market demographics are favorable, as the teenage population, the age when most contact lens wear begins, is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades. The reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide. CVI expects greater market penetration in Europe and Asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses. The Company continues to leverage benefits produced from the acquisition of Ocular in fiscal 2005 including new technologies, particularly patented silicone hydrogel and single-use lens technologies and higher volume manufacturing processes, particularly the Gen II platform. CVI will continue to invest in Gen II, which it expects will generate significant gross margin improvement as it continues to implement and convert high volume products to this manufacturing platform through the end of 2007. Single-use lenses continue to produce sales growth in all major markets with double-digit growth in the United States. We are in the process of developing and launching a number of new contact lens products that we believe will result in Cooper continuing to have a broad and competitive product line. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include lenses utilizing our proprietary PC Technology , lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, and new lens designs, including multifocal lenses. The market for contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials has grown significantly, and Cooper believes that this material is rapidly becoming a major product material in the industry. To date the Company has launched only one silicone hydrogel lens design with limited distribution. While initial customer reaction from this lens has been favorable, our future growth may be limited by several critical factors relating to silicone hydrogel materials. We are incurring additional manufacturing costs as we attempt to ramp up silicone hydrogel volumes and improve efficiencies. We are also engaged in litigation with regard to our silicone hydrogel product and certain lens design patents. We believe that our ability to succeed with silicone hydrogel products will be an important factor affecting future levels of sales growth and profitability. 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our revenue and operating results were impacted by order processing and shipping delays in September and October during the ongoing consolidation of our United States distribution activities into a new distribution center. The disruptions, which minimized promotions and delayed some revenue until subsequent periods and also impacted selling, general and administrative costs, were substantially resolved in November 2006. CSI has built an extensive product portfolio through acquisition and internal development, and we anticipate that CSI will continue to consolidate the women healthcare market. CSI expects to benefit from favorable demographic trends as the women of the baby-boomer generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures that utilize CSI products are performed most frequently. In November 2006, CSI expanded its hospital market presence by acquiring Lone Star, a manufacturer of medical devices that improve the management of the surgical site and are used in a wide variety of surgical procedures. CSI paid $27.2 million for Lone Star, and the acquisition complements CSI expansion into surgical products that began in November 2005 with the acquisition of NeoSurg, a manufacturer of a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system used in laparoscopic surgery, and Inlet, a manufacturer of trocar closure systems and pelvic floor reconstruction procedure kits. Highlights: Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005 Net sales up 6% to $859 million. Gross profit up 6%; gross margin decreased to 61% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Operating income down 17% to $112.9 million. Operating margin at 13% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Results include $13.6 million of stock option expenses, $8.9 million in losses and costs associated with phasing out corneal health products and the write-off of associated unrealizable net assets, $7.5 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development, $6.7 million of production start up costs, $10.1 million of distribution rationalization costs, $12.1 million of other restructuring and integration costs, $3.3 million of intellectual property and securities litigation costs and $4.1 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our amended and restated credit agreement. Effective tax rate (provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes) down to 9.7% from 15.4%. Diluted earnings per share down 29% to $1.44 from $2.04, with a 3% increase in the number of dilutive shares. 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Selected Statistical Information Percentage of Net Sales and Growth Years Ended October 31, 2006 % Growth 2005 % Growth 2004 Net sales 100 % 6 % 100 % 65 % 100 % Cost of sales 39 % 7 % 38 % 77 % 36 % Gross profit 61 % 6 % 62 % 58 % 64 % Selling, general and administrative expense 42 % 20 % 37 % 55 % 39 % Research and development expense 4 % (19 %) 5 % 560 % 1 % Restructuring costs 1 % (25 %) 1 % Amortization of intangibles 1 % 22 % 2 % 470 % Operating income 13 % (17 %) 17 % 17 % 24 % Net Sales Cooper two business units, CVI and CSI generate all its sales. CVI develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. CSI develops, manufactures and markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians. Our consolidated net sales grew by 6% in 2006 and 65% in 2005. CVI achieved 5% net sales growth primarily due to the January 6, 2005 acquisition of Ocular. CSI achieved 15% net sales growth in 2006, driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Business unit CVI $ 36.2 5% $ 309.3 80% CSI $ 16.1 15% $ 7.2 7% CSI Net Sales Women healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians and gynecologists practices generate over 90% of CSI revenue. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare where CSI does not actively market. CSI 2006 sales increased 15%, 6% on an organic basis, to $124.8 million, $16.1 million above 2005. Sales growth was primarily due to Inlet products, acquired on November 1, 2005. While unit growth and product mix influenced organic revenue growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence such growth. Results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date. CVI Net Sales by Market ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Growth Americas $ 351.9 $ 343.0 3 % Europe 273.3 250.1 9 % Asia-Pacific 109.0 104.9 4 % $ 734.2 $ 698.0 5 % 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI worldwide net sales grew 5%, 7% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 3%, 2% in constant currency. European sales grew 9%, 12% in constant currency. Sales to the Asia-Pacific region grew 4%, 10% in constant currency. CVI Net Sales Practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change. The major shifts are from: Conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Commodity lenses to specialty lenses defined as toric, including silicone hydrogels, multifocal and cosmetic lenses. Commodity spherical lenses to value-added spherical lenses such as, continuous wear lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. Although these shifts generally favor CVI line of specialty and value added products, which now comprise more than 50% of CVI worldwide business, it is important that CVI has yet to develop sufficient manufacturing capabilities to compete in the market for silicone hydrogel products. In fiscal 2006, CVI commenced a limited launch of a silicone hydrogel product in Europe, selected markets in the Asia-Pacific region and the United States and is in the process of expanding related manufacturing capabilities to grow sales. Definitions: Contact lens revenue includes sales of conventional, disposable, long-term extended wear lenses and single-use spherical lenses, some of which are aspherically designed, and specialty lenses toric lenses, cosmetic lenses and multifocal lenses. Core product revenue includes specialty lenses plus PC Technology brand spherical lenses, silicone hydrogel spherical lenses and single-use spherical lenses. Aspheric lenses correct for near- and farsightedness and have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia, an age-related vision defect. Toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye. Multifocal lens designs correct presbyopia. Proclear lenses, manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology , help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort. Net sales growth includes increases in disposable toric sales up 16%, single-use spheres up 21%, disposable multifocals up 31% and total toric sales up 11%. CVI core product lines grew 11% and Proclear products, including Biomedics XC , grew 29%. Proclear toric sales grew 42%, Proclear 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) spheres up 15% and Proclear multifocal lenses up 101%. Total sphere sales excluding single-use lenses declined 3% with total sphere sales up 2%. Single-use sales growth remained below expectations due largely to slower than anticipated acceptance of new products and delays in our transition to the new strip-blister packaging configuration. A majority of our lines have now been converted, and we expect all lines to be converted by February 2007. Sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix influenced sales growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence sales growth. CVI results include Ocular beginning on January 6, 2005, when Cooper acquired Ocular. To present CVI organic growth, this paragraph discusses reported sales adjusted by adding Ocular net sales of $51.6 million for November 1, 2004 through January 5, 2005, when Cooper did not own Ocular, to CVI reported net sales of $697.9 million for Cooper fiscal 2005. As so adjusted, organic net sales declined 2%, 1% in constant currency. Americas sales declined 2%, 3% in constant currency, European sales grew 2%, 5% in constant currency, and Asia-Pacific sales declined 9%, 4% in constant currency. CVI core product lines grew 5% with single-use lens growth of 3%. Disposable lens sales were flat with disposable toric sales up 11%, disposable multifocal lens sales up 25% and disposable spheres declining 6%. CVI New Products and Markets During calendar 2006 CVI introduced these new products: Biofinity silicone hydrogel monthly sphere in a limited launch in the United States and selected markets in Asia-Pacific. Biomedics XC disposable sphere, a two-week aspheric lens featuring Proclear technology, in the United States, Europe and selected markets in Asia-Pacific. A second base curve of Proclear toric, effectively doubling the number of Proclear parameters available for astigmatic patients. Single-use sphere in new strip-blister packaging. Single-use toric in Japan. Aspheric, two-week, 55% water content sphere in Japan. Biomedics EP , a multifocal specifically designed for emerging presbyopic patients. Products scheduled for introduction in calendar 2007 include: Proclear single-use in the United States and Europe and Proclear multifocal toric (a multifocal toric for monthly replacement), Proclear toric XR (extended parameter range) and an improved two-week silicone hydrogel sphere in the United States. Biofinity toric, a silicone hydrogel product, is currently expected to be introduced in the United States and Europe in late calendar 2007 or early 2008 depending on manufacturing capacity available for toric lenses after satisfying demand for Biofinity sphere. 42 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2005 Compared with 2004 Highlights: Fiscal Year 2005 vs. Fiscal Year 2004 Net sales up 65% to $806.6 million. Gross profit up 57%; gross margin decreased to 62% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Operating income up 16% to $135.8 million. Operating margin at 17% of net sales including integration and restructuring items. Results include the $16.8 million impact related to the step up of Ocular inventory to reflect purchased manufacturing profit sold post acquisition, $20 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development, $12.9 million of restructuring and integration costs and the $1.6 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our previous credit agreement. Effective tax rate (provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes) down to 15.4% from 17.5%. Diluted earnings per share down 21% to $2.04 from $2.59, with a 26% increase in the number of dilutive shares. Net Sales Growth Our consolidated net sales grew by 65% in 2005 and 19% in 2004. CVI has consistently achieved double-digit net sales growth over the three-year period driven by organic growth as well as acquisitions. CSI achieved 7% net sales growth in 2005, primarily driven by organic growth, and double-digit growth in the prior two periods driven by acquisition and organic growth. ($ in millions) 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Business unit CVI $ 309.3 80% $ 59.1 18% CSI $ 7.2 7% $ 19.3 23% CVI Net Sales by Market ($ in millions) 2005 2004 Growth Americas $ 343.0 $ 217.6 58 % Europe 250.1 149.5 67 % Asia-Pacific 104.9 21.6 386 % $ 698.0 $ 388.7 80 % CVI worldwide net sales grew 80%, 77% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 58%, 56% in constant currency. European sales grew 67%, 63% in constant currency. Sales to the Asia-Pacific region grew 386%, 379% in constant currency. The inclusion of Ocular net sales, since the acquisition date of January 6, 2005, is the primary reason for CVI growth in fiscal 2005. 43 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CSI Net Sales Women healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians and gynecologists practices generate about 90% of CSI revenue. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare where CSI does not actively market. In 2005, CSI sales increased 7% to $108.7 million, $7.2 million above 2004. CSI core revenue grew 10%. While unit growth and product mix influenced organic revenue growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence such growth. Results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date. CVI Net Sales Sales growth included continued global market gains during the year, including increases in disposable spherical sales up 121%, disposable toric sales up 62%, disposable multifocal sales up 142% and total toric sales up 51%. CVI core product lines grew 76% with specialty lens growth of 46% during the year. Sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of Proclear toric that increased 62% to $25.4 million and the launch of Proclear multifocal lenses with 2005 sales of $10.6 million. Single-use lens revenue was $72.4 million during the year. Sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold, as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement, including within rapidly growing specialty lenses and daily disposable spheres. While unit growth and product mix influenced sales growth, average realized prices by product did not materially influence sales growth. CVI results include Ocular beginning on January 6, 2005, when Cooper acquired Ocular. To present CVI organic growth, we have adjusted reported sales in this discussion for Ocular unaudited net sales when Cooper did not own Ocular of $269.3 million for January 6, 2004 through October 31, 2004 with CVI reported net sales of $388.7 million for Cooper fiscal 2004. Organic net sales grew 6%, 4% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 1%, European sales grew 8%, 5% in constant currency, and Asia-Pacific sales grew 22%, 20% in constant currency. CVI core product lines grew 20% with specialty lens growth of 17% and single-use lens growth of 38%. Disposable lens sales growth included spherical lens sales up 5%, disposable toric sales up 26% and disposable multifocal lens sales up 59%. During 2005, CVI lost, on an organic basis, market share in the two-week spherical lens market in the United States. 2006 Compared to 2005 and 2005 Compared to 2004 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2006 2005 2004 CVI 62 % 62 % 67 % CSI 58 % 57 % 55 % Consolidated 61 % 62 % 64 % Included in the 2006 margin for CVI was $6.7 million for production start up costs primarily related to our silicone hydrogel products, $8.3 million of restructuring and integration expenses, $1.1 million of phase out costs for our corneal health products and $0.5 million for share-based compensation expense. In addition, we have lower gross margin on single-use lenses that now account for about 12% of CVI 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) net sales. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to the recognition in cost of sales of a $16.8 million step up of Ocular inventory to reflect purchased manufacturing profit sold post acquisition and $5.4 million of restructuring expenses. About 44% of lens units are manufactured in the United Kingdom. The favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs. CSI gross margin improved to 58% in 2006 from 57% in 2005 and from 55% in 2004 reflecting high margins on product lines acquired during the year, continuing efficiencies from CSI restructuring activities completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and the successful integration of acquisitions. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 CVI $ 284.3 $ 243.0 $ 147.9 CSI 44.7 37.9 31.9 Headquarters 28.8 17.1 10.7 $ 357.8 $ 298.0 $ 190.5 Consolidated SGA increased by 20% in 2006, 56% in 2005 and 17% in 2004. Costs to support the increase in sales along with stock option expenses, restructuring and integration costs and intellectual property and securities litigation costs contributed to the increase in SGA in 2006. Acquisitions, primarily Ocular, contributed largely to the increase in 2005 SGA. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SGA increased to 42% in fiscal 2006 from 37% in 2005 and 39% in 2004. CVI SGA increased 17% in 2006, primarily due to stock option expenses, integration costs and intellectual property litigation costs, and 64% in 2005, primarily due to the acquisition of Ocular. SGA as a percentage of net sales increased to 39% in 2006; and decreased to 35% in 2005 from 38% in 2004 on reductions of selling, marketing and distribution costs. CSI 2006 SGA increased 18% over 2005, which supported the 15% increase in sales, and 2005 SGA increased 19% over 2004. Selling and marketing costs increased to support sales growth, and stock option expenses contributed to the increase. Corporate headquarters SGA, which increased 64% to $28.8 million in 2006 and 59% to $17.1 million in 2005, were 3% and 2%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. The growth in 2006 was primarily due to stock option and securities litigation expense. The growth since 2004 include added costs due to the Ocular acquisition, continued expenses for projects and staff to maintain the Company global trading arrangement and costs to comply with corporate governance requirements. Research and Development Expense Research and development expense, exclusive of acquired in-process research and development in 2006 of $7.5 million at CSI and in 2005 of $20 million at CVI, was 3% of net sales in both fiscal 2006 and 2005 and 1% in fiscal 2004: $27.0 million in 2006, $22.9 million in 2005 and $6.5 million in 2004. 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CVI research and development expenditures were $23.5 million in fiscal 2006 and $19.8 million in fiscal 2005, up 401% over 2004. CVI research and development activities include programs to develop silicone hydrogel products, product lines utilizing PC Technology and expansion of single-use product lines. CSI research and development expenditures of $3.5 million, were up 13%. CSI research and development activities were for newly acquired laparoscopic surgical devices and for upgrading and redesign of many CSI osteoporoses, in-vitro fertilization, incontinence and assisted reproductive technology products and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities. Restructuring Restructuring expenses were $6.4 million in 2006, including expenses of CVI related to the integration of Ocular and the phase out of corneal health product lines and $8.5 million in 2005 with $6.1 million resulting from the integration of Ocular with CVI and $2.4 million related to CSI integration activities. In connection with the January 6, 2005, acquisition of Ocular, CVI is progressing through our integration plan that is designed to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies. These activities include integrating duplicate facilities and expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices. Integration activities began in January 2005 and are expected to continue through 2007. We estimate that the total restructuring costs under this integration plan will be approximately $45 $50 million, of which approximately $25 $30 million are cash related and will be reported as charges to cost of sales or restructuring costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 2. Acquisitions. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $14.3 million in 2006, $11.7 million in 2005 and $2.1 million in 2004. Amortization expense increased in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 primarily due to acquired intangible assets including the addition of $130 million of other intangible assets from Ocular in fiscal 2005. 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Concluded) Operating Income Operating income declined $3.9 million or 3% between 2004 and 2006. Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 CVI $ 126.6 $ 135.5 $ 106.6 CSI 15.1 17.4 20.9 Headquarters (28.8 ) (17.1 ) (10.7 ) $ 112.9 $ 135.8 $ 116.8 Percent (decline) growth (17 )% 17 % 23 % Other (Expense) Income, Net Years Ended October 31, (In thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Interest income $ 386 $ 1,002 $ 351 Gain on sale of Quidel stock 120 1,443 Foreign exchange (loss) gain (1,417 ) (376 ) 69 Write-off of debt issuance cost (4,085 ) (1,602 ) Gain on derivative instruments 1,945 Other expense (1,201 ) (343 ) (121 ) $ (6,317 ) $ 746 $ 1,742 In fiscal 2006, we wrote off the debt issuance costs of our amended and restated credit agreement of $4.1 million, and in fiscal 2005, we wrote off the debt issuance costs of our previous credit agreement of $1.6 million. In 2006, we recognized a net loss of about $1.4 million related to the Euro and British pound weakening against the U.S. dollar, primarily in the first nine months of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, we sold our remaining 292,000 shares of Quidel stock and realized a gain of about $120,000. The fiscal 2005 realized gain on derivative instruments of $1.9 million relates to effective hedges in the form of interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, which were terminated and replaced with interest rate swaps that did qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We expect the new swaps to qualify for hedge accounting through their maturities. See Note 8. Financial Instruments. Interest Expense Interest expense increased 18% to $33.2 million in 2006 and 373% to $28.1 million in 2005 from $6 million in 2004. The fiscal 2006 increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt balances compared to fiscal 2005 and the increase over fiscal 2004 is due to the proceeds of a new credit facility used to fund the cash portion to acquire Ocular. We had $605.3 million in loans on our credit facility at October 31, 2006, compared to $557.2 million outstanding on October 31, 2005. On January 6, 2005, we replaced our $225 million credit facility with a $750 million credit agreement primarily to fund the acquisition of Ocular. On December 12, 2005, we amended and restated our 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Concluded) $750 million syndicated credit facility. The amendment and restatement extended maturities and provided the Company with additional borrowing flexibility and lower overall pricing. The amendment refinanced the $465 million outstanding of Term A and Term B loans under the prior facility and is comprised of a revolving credit facility, which was increased from $275 million to $500 million, and a $250 million term loan. In addition, the Company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $250 million. KeyBank led the amendment process, which resulted in substantially all original syndicate banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement. The amendment significantly reduces principal payment requirements in 2006 through 2009. We wrote off about $4.1 million of debt issuance costs as a result of amending the original facility in the first fiscal quarter of 2006. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate (ETR) for fiscal 2006 was 9.7% down from 15.4% in fiscal 2005 and 17.5% in 2004. The reduction of our ETR resulted primarily from a greater percentage of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the U.S. statutory rate. Share-Based Compensation Plans Effective November 1, 2005, the Company began recording compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Prior to November 1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock options according to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations, and, therefore, no related compensation expense was recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method provided for under SFAS 123R and, consequently, has not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with stock options recognized in fiscal 2006 includes: 1) amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to November 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123; Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123) and 2) amortization related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to November 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the Company consolidated financial statements for stock options and restricted stock awards were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended October 31, 2006 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 13.2 Cost of products sold 0.7 Research and development expense 0.3 Capitalized in inventory 0.5 Total compensation $ 14.7 Related income tax benefit $ 3.2 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Concluded) Cash received from options exercised under all share-based payment arrangements for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $3.0 million, $25.2 million and $13.8 million, respectively. The Company continues to estimate the fair value of each share-based award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Previously, under SFAS 123, the Company did not utilize separate employee groupings in the determination of option values. The Company now estimates option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Year 2006 Highlights Operating cash flow $162.7 million, down 11%. Paid acquisition costs of $68 million. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $154.9 million vs. $117.1 million in 2005. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 8.2 $ 30.8 Total assets $ 2,352.6 $ 2,179.8 Working capital $ 180.3 $ 186.1 Total debt $ 742.7 $ 704.9 Stockholders equity $ 1,378.5 $ 1,273.2 Ratio of debt to equity 0.54:1 0.55:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 35% 36% Operating Cash Flows Cash flow provided from operating activities continued as Cooper major source of liquidity, totaling $162.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $183.8 million in 2005. Working capital decreased $5.8 million in fiscal 2006 due to decreases of $22.6 million in cash, $6.0 million in receivables, $3.8 million in current deferred tax assets, $5.2 million in other current assets and an increase of $29.9 million in current accrued liabilities and accounts payable. These changes were partially offset by an increase of $50.8 million in inventory and a decrease of $10.9 million in short-term debt. The inventory increase and related increase in inventory months on hand (MOH) was primarily to support new product launches and distribution center consolidations in the United States and Europe. Cooper MOH was 8.0 at the end of fiscal 2006 as compared to 6.5 at fiscal year end 2005. Cooper 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) receivable collections remained consistent with days sales outstanding (DSO s) at the end of the current year increasing slightly to 63 days, which is consistent with the 62 days at October 31, 2005. Looking forward, we expect DSO in the mid 60 given our expectations for continued strong growth outside the United States where DSO are higher. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. Investing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $222.8 million for investing activities in 2006 was driven by payments of $68.0 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of $154.9 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity, consolidate distribution centers and to continue the rollout of new information systems. Financing Cash Flows The cash inflow of $37.3 million from financing activities in 2006 was driven by net proceeds from debt of $37.6 million and $3.0 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payment of debt acquisition costs of $0.6 million and dividends on our common stock of $2.7 million paid in the first and third quarters of 2006. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2006, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) 2007 2008 & 2009 2010 & 2011 2012 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 37.9 $ 111.6 $ 456.7 $ 113.0 Interest payments on long-term debt 39.5 78.6 63.3 3.0 Operating leases 23.1 34.6 27.2 45.7 Total contractual obligations 100.5 224.8 547.2 161.7 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 0.3 Total $ 100.8 $ 224.8 $ 547.2 $ 161.7 The expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2015 are disclosed in Note 11. Employee Benefits. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Risk Management Most of our operations outside of the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations functional currency. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreements and term loan debt varies with the London Interbank Offered Rate. We have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging $525 million of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for periods 3 months to 2 1 / 4 years and issuing fixed rate debt in the form of 2.625% convertible debentures. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Outlook We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $8.2 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and smaller acquisitions including Lone Star acquired on November 2, 2006. At October 31, 2006, we had $144.4 million available under the $750 million syndicated bank credit facility. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three years. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). In SAB 108, the SEC staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. SAB 108 permits public companies to initially apply its provisions either by (i) restating prior financial statements or (ii) recording the cumulative effect as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company is required to adopt SAB 108 by the end of fiscal 2007. The Company has not completed its analysis but does not expect adoption to have a significant impact on the Company results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact SFAS 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited exceptions. This statement is effective for financial statements as of the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact SFAS 158 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) . FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Under FIN 48, a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax position that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. For the Company, FIN 48 will be effective for our 2008 fiscal year. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statement of operations prior to and after the adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating FIN 48 and its possible impacts on the Company financial statements. Upon adoption, there is a possibility that the cumulative effect would result in a charge or benefit to the beginning balance of retained earnings, increases or decreases in future effective tax rates, and/or increases in future effective tax rate volatility. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CSI medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been major factors in our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our analyses indicate, we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economies. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our specialty lens product portfolio. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). We no longer amortize goodwill. The SFAS 142 goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. When available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CVI and CSI reflecting the way that we manage our business. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. We performed an impairment test in our third fiscal quarter 2006, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. The valuation of each of our reporting units was determined using a combination of discounted cash flows, an income valuation approach, and the guideline company method, a market valuation approach. 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased, acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. On individually significant acquisitions, we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation, if appropriate. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the quarterly tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. Share-Based Compensation Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) as interpreted by SEC SAB No. 107, using the modified prospective transition method. Prior periods have not been restated. See Note 10. Stock Plans for a further description of the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R and the Company share-based compensation plans. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates. The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, 54 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Concluded) historical implied volatility of the Company publicly-traded options, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant. As share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period. In 2005 and 2004, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company valued its share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) , and related interpretations. 55 Table of Contents
