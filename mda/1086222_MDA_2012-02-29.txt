Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We provide content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. We primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer, which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long-term contracts. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum. In recent years, we have also entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly, annual or longer periods. Having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be successful, we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost recurring revenue due to price reductions and customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services and features that our existing customers purchase. At the same time, we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth. Accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality, price and the attractiveness of our services and technology. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See Risk Factors elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or other events that may be announced after the date hereof. Recent Event On February 8, 2012, we announced the resignation of J. Donald Sherman as our Chief Financial Officer effective on February 29, 2012 and the appointment of James Benson, Akamai's Senior Vice President of Finance, as his successor effective as of March 1, 2012. Overview of Financial Results Our increase in net income in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2009 reflected the success of our efforts to increase our recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support such growth. The following sets forth, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated: 2011 2010 2009 Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenues 32 30 29 Research and development 5 5 5 Sales and marketing 20 22 21 General and administrative 17 16 17 Amortization of other intangible assets 1 2 2 Restructuring charge Total costs and operating expenses 75 75 74 Income from operations 25 25 26 Interest income 1 1 2 Interest expense Other income (expense), net (Loss) gain on investments, net Loss on early extinguishment of debt Income before provision for income taxes 26 26 28 Provision for income taxes 9 9 11 Net income 17 % 17 % 17 % We were profitable for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009; however, we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future. We have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future: 20 Table of Contents Revenues and Customers In recent years, we have been able to offset lost committed recurring revenues by adding new customers and increasing sales of incremental services to our existing customers. A continuation of this trend could lead to increased overall revenues; however, any such increased revenues would be offset if we experience lower traffic from non-committed revenues or declines in the prices we charge. If we do not offset lost committed revenues in this manner, our overall revenues will decrease. Our unit prices offered to some customers have declined as a result of increased competition. These price reductions primarily impacted customers for which we deliver high volumes of traffic over our network, such as digital media customers. If we continue to experience decreases in unit prices and are unable to offset such reductions with increased traffic, enhanced efficiencies in our network, lower co-location and bandwidth expenses, or increased sales of incremental services to existing customers, our revenues and profit margins could decrease. During 2011, we experienced a moderation in the rate of traffic growth in our video and software download solutions as compared prior periods. If this trend continues, our ability to generate revenue growth could be adversely impacted. Historically, we have experienced seasonal variations of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of the year and lower revenues during the summer months. We primarily attribute such variations to patterns of usage of e-commerce services by our retail customers. If this trend continues, our ability to generate quarterly revenue growth on a sequential basis could be impacted. During 2011, revenues derived from customers outside the United States accounted for 29% of our total revenues. For 2012, we anticipate revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues to be consistent with 2011. Costs and Expenses During 2011, we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit and to invest in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. Our total bandwidth costs increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to traffic growth on our network. We believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels, partially offset by anticipated continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit. If we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing or we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers, total network bandwidth costs could increase more than expected in 2012. In 2011, co-location costs increased and became a higher percentage of total cost of revenues due to continued expansion of our network. By improving our internal-use software to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we believe we can manage the growth of co-location costs by deploying fewer servers. If we are unable to achieve such cost reductions, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Depreciation and amortization expense related to our network equipment and internal-use software development costs increased by $23.5 million during 2011 as compared to 2010. Due to expected future purchases of network equipment during 2012, we believe that depreciation expense related to our network equipment will continue to increase in 2012. We expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings, which would increase capitalized stock-based compensation expense attributable to employees working on such projects. As a result, we believe that the amortization of internal-use software development costs, which we include in cost of revenues, will be higher in 2012 as compared to 2011. All of these increased costs could negatively affect our profitability. We expect to continue to grant restricted stock units, or RSUs, to employees in the future; therefore, we anticipate that stock-based compensation expense will increase. As of December 31, 2011, our total unrecognized compensation costs for stock-based awards were $110.9 million , which we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. This expense is expected to be recognized through 2015. For fiscal 2011, our effective income tax rate was 34.6%. We expect our annual effective income tax rate in 2012 to increase due to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of 2011, as well as the change in mix of income in various jurisdictions; this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation, any tax planning strategies or the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations. Based on our analysis of, among other things, the aforementioned trends and events, as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2012 ; however, our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, including our ability to: 21 Table of Contents increase our revenue by adding customers through recurring revenue contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations; offset unit price declines for our services with higher volumes of traffic delivered on our network as well as increased sales of our value-added solutions; prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks; and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues. As a result, there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives, including generating positive net income, in any future period. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Overview Our MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software costs, goodwill and other intangible assets, tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, loss contingencies and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Definitions We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes. Review of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition: We recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition, including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly, quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly, quarterly or annual minimum. For these services, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage. For annual or other non-monthly period revenue commitments, we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof. We typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated. The integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. We also derive revenue from services sold as discrete, non-recurring events or based solely on usage. For these services, we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred. When more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement, we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, for each respective element, including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer. For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE, third-party evidence, or TPE, of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor. For arrangements in which we are unable to establish VSOE or TPE for each element, we use the best estimate of selling price, or BESP, to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables. We allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method. 22 Table of Contents At the inception of a customer contract for service, we make an estimate as to that customer ability to pay for the services provided. We base our estimate on a combination of factors, including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review, our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. If we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer. Changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize. We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments. Amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided. From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies. If we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor product or service can be objectively established. We may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties. We record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service, such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service. If these conditions are present, we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees, prepayments made by customers for future periods, deferred integration and activation set-up fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms. Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash-basis. Increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses. Increases in the reserve for cash-basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue. The reserve for cash-basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received. Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments. Valuation and Impairment of Investments and Marketable Securities: We measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability. Investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. We periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors, overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. Write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different 23 Table of Contents from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment. Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets: We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 . We performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of such dates, and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill. Other intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights. Purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets. Goodwill is carried at its historical cost. Loss Contingencies: We define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation. We record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability, but we disclose the nature of these loss contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Tax Reserves: Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized. We currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated. Uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2011, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $17.2 million, including accrued interest and penalties. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation: We issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, RSUs and deferred stock units. We measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. We have selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards 24 Table of Contents at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. Changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock options that are expected to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. In addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. Changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations. For stock options, RSUs and deferred stock units that contain only a service-based vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the awards vesting period. For awards with a performance condition-based vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on a graded-vesting basis over the awards expected vesting period, commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs: We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related costs, as well as stock-based compensation expense, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software projects. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is complete, we estimate the useful life of the internal-use software, and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period. Results of Operations Revenues. Total revenues increased 13% , or $135.0 million , to $1,158.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $1,023.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Total revenues increased 19% , or $163.8 million , to $1,023.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $859.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . The following table quantifies the increase in revenues attributable to the different industry verticals in which we sell our services (in millions): For the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 For the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 Media & Entertainment $ 45.7 $ 75.9 Commerce 46.1 38.7 Enterprise 33.5 20.0 High Tech 4.9 15.0 Public Sector 4.8 14.2 Total net increase $ 135.0 $ 163.8 We believe that the continued growth in use of the Internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services during each of the last several years. We expect this trend to continue in 2012 but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and competitive factors. The increase in revenues for 2011 as compared to 2010, as well as 2010 as compared to 2009, was driven by increased revenues from our media and entertainment vertical due to traffic growth, partially offset by reduced prices charged to our customers. Revenues from our commerce and enterprise verticals increased due to growth in application and cloud performance solutions sold to customers in these verticals. Revenues from our high tech vertical in 2011 as compared to 2010 remained relatively flat as increased demand for application and cloud performance solutions offset the decline in software download revenues. The increase in revenues from our high tech vertical in 2010 as compared to 2009, was due to an increase in traffic growth as well as an increase in demand for our application and cloud performance solution services. Our 2011 revenues from the public sector vertical did not materially change as compared to 2010. The increase in 2010 revenues from public sector customers as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers and government contracts. For 2011, 2010 and 2009 , 29% , 28% and 28% , respectively, of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the United States. Revenue from our operations in Europe represented 18% , 17% and 18% of total revenues for 2011, 25 Table of Contents 2010 and 2009 , respectively. Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during these periods. We expect international sales as a percentage of our total sales in 2012 to remain consistent as compared to 2011. Resellers accounted for 19% of total revenues in 2011 , 18% in 2010 and 18% in 2009 . For 2011, 2010 and 2009 , no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co-location of our network equipment. Cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation expense for network operations personnel, cost of software licenses, depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal-use software. Cost of revenues was comprised of the following (in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Bandwidth and service-related fees $ 92.0 $ 79.9 $ 73.6 Co-location fees 130.8 96.1 72.1 Payroll and related costs of network operations personnel 15.3 14.0 11.6 Stock-based compensation, including amortization of prior capitalized amounts 9.6 10.3 8.6 Depreciation and impairment of network equipment 96.8 76.3 63.7 Amortization of internal-use software 30.0 26.8 20.3 Total cost of revenues $ 374.5 $ 303.4 $ 249.9 Cost of revenues increased 23% , or $71.1 million , to $374.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $303.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Cost of revenues increased 21% , or $53.5 million , to $303.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $249.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . In each instance, these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels, partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit, an increase in co-location costs as we deployed more servers, and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure. Additionally, in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009 , cost of revenues included stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; such expense decreased by $0.7 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased by $1.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. Cost of revenues during each of 2011, 2010 and 2009 also included credits received of approximately $6.9 million , $7.1 million and $3.5 million , respectively, from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts. Credits of this nature may occur in the future; however, the timing and amount of future credits, if any, are unpredictable. We have long-term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location with various networks and Internet service providers. As of December 31, 2011 , our current minimum commitments for the years ending December 31, 2012 , 2013 , 2014 and 2015 were approximately $88.8 million , $12.8 million , $0.7 million and $0.1 million , respectively. We believe cost of revenues will increase in 2012 as compared to 2011. We expect to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on our network, which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and co-location fees; however, such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit. Additionally, for 2012, we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal-use software development costs, along with increased payroll and related costs, as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel who design, develop, test, deploy and enhance our services and our network. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 , we capitalized software development costs of $39.0 million , $31.1 million and $25.8 million , respectively, net of impairments. These development costs consisted of external consulting, payroll and payroll-related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 , we capitalized as internal-use software $7.1 million , $7.6 million and $6.2 million , respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation, net of impairments. We amortize these capitalized internal-use software costs to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years. 26 Table of Contents Research and development expenses decreased 4% , or $2.4 million , to $52.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Research and development expenses increased 25% , or $11.1 million , to $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . The decrease in research and development expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth. The increase in research and development expenses in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to increases in payroll and related costs and stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher capitalized salaries. The following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Research and Development Expenses 2011 to 2010 2010 to 2009 Payroll and related costs $ 9.0 $ 11.6 Stock-based compensation (2.3 ) 3.6 Capitalized salaries and other (9.1 ) (4.1 ) Total net (decrease) increase $ (2.4 ) $ 11.1 We believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology, develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs, stock-based compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing, sales and support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.6 million , to $227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $226.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Sales and marketing expenses increased 26% , or $47.3 million , to $226.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $179.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . The increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs, particularly commissions for sales and sales support personnel, attributable to revenue growth, largely offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation, marketing and related costs and other expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs, particularly higher commissions for sales and sales support personnel, an increase in stock-based compensation, marketing and related costs and an increase in other expenses, such as travel costs, which was partially offset by a reduction in training and conference costs. The following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Sales and Marketing Expenses 2011 to 2010 2010 to 2009 Payroll and related costs $ 10.3 $ 33.0 Stock-based compensation (7.5 ) 8.1 Marketing and related costs (0.4 ) 3.9 Other expense (1.8 ) 2.3 Total net increase $ 0.6 $ 47.3 We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2012 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services and an increase in payroll and related costs due to continued growth in the number of our sales and marketing personnel. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components: payroll, stock-based compensation expense and other related costs, including expenses for executive, finance, business applications, network management, human resources and other administrative personnel; depreciation and amortization of property and equipment we use internally; 27 Table of Contents fees for professional services; rent and other facility-related expenditures for leased properties; the provision for doubtful accounts; insurance costs; and non-income related taxes. General and administrative expenses increased 14% , or $23.9 million , to $191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $167.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . General and administrative expenses increased 15% , or $21.7 million , to $167.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2011 as compared to 2010, was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth, an increase in facilities-related costs and other expenses such as acquisition related costs, an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts, and an increase in legal fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation and non-income tax expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth and increases in stock-based compensation, facilities-related costs and other expenses such as non-capitializable equipment purchases and maintenance. These increases were partially offset by reductions in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2010 as compared to 2009. The following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in General and Administrative Expenses 2011 to 2010 2010 to 2009 Payroll and related costs $ 11.5 $ 13.3 Stock-based compensation (3.7 ) 5.4 Non-income taxes (0.4 ) 0.1 Facilities-related costs 7.4 2.6 Depreciation and amortization 0.8 0.7 Provision for doubtful accounts 1.8 (7.0 ) Legal fees 1.8 1.1 Consulting and advisory services 0.2 (0.1 ) Other expenses 4.5 5.6 Total net increase $ 23.9 $ 21.7 We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights. Amortization of other intangible assets increased 2% , or $0.4 million , to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Amortization of other intangible assets remained consistent at $16.7 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 . The increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to the acquisition of Velocitude in June 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we anticipate that amortization expense will be approximately $16.6 million , $13.2 million , $7.2 million , $4.6 million and $2.1 million for the years ending December 31, 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 and 2016 , respectively. Restructuring Charge. We recorded a restructuring charge of $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily in connection with a workforce reduction we implemented in December 2011. This charge included $4.2 million of employee severance benefits and $0.7 million of restructuring charges attributable to vacated facility leases. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a restructuring charge of $0.5 million in connection with employee severance benefits. We did not have any restructuring charges in 2010. We expect that our restructuring liabilities associated with employee severance benefits will be fully paid in 2012. Restructuring liabilities associated with facility leases will be fully paid through December 2019. Interest Income. Interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities. Interest income 28 Table of Contents decreased 12% , or $1.5 million , to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Interest income decreased 22% , or $3.5 million , to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . The decreases in 2011 as compared to 2010 and in 2010 as compared to 2009 were primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments during the comparable periods. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes interest that was paid on our former debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding interest-bearing indebtedness requiring the payment of interest and therefore had no interest expense. Interest expense decreased 40% , or $1.1 million , to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . Interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our 1% convertible senior notes. The decrease in interest expense in 2010 resulted from the conversion into common stock of an aggregate of $199.8 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible notes during that year. Other Income (Expense), net. Other income (expense) , net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred, gains and losses from legal settlements, and other non-operating income (expense) items. Other income (expense), net increased $8.6 million to $6.1 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $2.5 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Other income (expense), net decreased $2.6 million to $2.5 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $0.2 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2009 . Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of foreign exchange losses and net funds received and paid as part of litigation settlements. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted of foreign exchange losses. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted of $0.8 million of gains on legal settlements and $1.1 million of gains on divesture of certain assets, offset by $1.7 million of foreign exchange losses. Other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates, the outcome of legal proceedings and other events. (Loss) Gain on Investments, net. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , we recorded a net loss on investments of $0.2 million primarily related to the sale of marketable securities and a write-off of an equity investment. During the year ended December 31, 2010 , we recorded a net gain on investments of $0.4 million primarily related to the sale of marketable securities. Additionally, during 2010 we recorded a gain of $9.6 million due to a decrease in the other-than-temporary impairment of certain auction rate securities, or ARS, offset by a loss of $9.6 million on a put option related to our ARS holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2009 , we recorded a net gain on investments of $0.8 million , which primarily related to an unrealized gain of $3.3 million from a decrease in the other-than-temporary impairment of certain marketable securities offset by an unrealized loss of $2.9 million on a put option related to our ARS holdings. Provision for Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our effective tax rate of 34.6% was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings, partially offset by state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our effective tax rate of 34.7% was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits partially offset by state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our effective tax rate of 38.5% was higher than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of non-deductible stock-based compensation, partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits. Provision for income taxes increased 17%, or $15.1 million, to $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Provision for income taxes remained consistent at $91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in operating income. The slight decrease from 2009 to 2010 was due to a decrease in the effective tax rate, offset by an increase in operating income. We expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2012 to increase due to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of 2011, as well as the change in mix of income in various jurisdictions; this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stock-based compensation or any potential tax planning strategies. Our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options. Further, our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, including settlements of tax audits and assessments, the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies. In determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates, and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections. We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different 29 Table of Contents taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the traditional financial measurements reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, we also compile and monitor certain non-GAAP financial measures related to the performance of our business. We typically discuss the non-GAAP financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the GAAP statement of operations. We believe that making available the non-GAAP financial measures described below helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts or competitors financial information. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. We consider normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted common share to be important indicators of our overall performance as they eliminate the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are non-cash items. We define normalized net income as net income determined in accordance with GAAP excluding the following pre-tax items: amortization of other acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internal-use software, restructuring charges and benefits, acquisition-related costs and benefits, certain gains and losses on investments, loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains and losses on legal settlements. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles GAAP net income to normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 : Unaudited For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Net income $ 200,904 $ 171,220 $ 145,913 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets 17,070 16,657 16,722 Stock-based compensation 61,305 76,468 58,797 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation 7,308 7,509 6,413 Loss (gain) on investments, net 500 (457 ) Utilization of tax NOLs/credits Loss on early extinguishment of debt 299 Acquisition related costs (benefits) 580 (415 ) Restructuring charge 4,886 454 Legal settlements, net (8,043 ) Total normalized net income $ 284,510 $ 271,738 $ 227,842 Normalized net income per diluted share $ 1.52 $ 1.43 $ 1.22 Shares used in normalized net income per diluted share calculation 187,556 190,650 188,658 We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be another important indicator of our operational strength and the performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income determined in accordance with GAAP excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internal-use software, restructuring charges and benefits, acquisition-related costs and benefits, certain gains and losses on investments, foreign exchange gains and losses, loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains or losses on legal settlements. 30 Table of Contents The following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 : Unaudited For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Net income $ 200,904 $ 171,220 $ 145,913 Amortization of other acquired intangible assets 17,070 16,657 16,722 Stock-based compensation 61,305 76,468 58,797 Amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation 7,308 7,509 6,413 Loss (gain) on investments, net 500 (457 ) Utilization of tax NOLs/credits Loss on early extinguishment of debt 299 Acquisition related costs (benefits) 580 (415 ) Restructuring charge 4,886 454 Legal settlements, net (8,043 ) Interest income, net of interest expense (10,921 ) (10,862 ) (13,132 ) Provision for income taxes 106,291 91,152 91,319 Depreciation and amortization 143,500 119,076 99,358 Other loss (income), net 1,918 2,468 (163 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 525,298 $ 473,572 $ 405,224 For the year ended December 31, 2009, we previously reported Utilization of tax NOLs/credits of $84.2 million in the tables above which increased our non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA. Beginning in 2010, we no longer include Utilization of tax NOLs/credits in determining our non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA due to fully utilizing most of our NOLs and tax credit carryforwards in 2010. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities, proceeds from exercises of stock awards and cash generated by operations. As of December 31, 2011 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which consisted of corporate debt securities, United States treasury and government agency securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities and money market funds, totaled $1,230.0 million , the majority of which is located in the United States. We place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy also limits our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal, maintaining adequate liquidity at all times, and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy. We held approximately $150.8 million in par value of auction rate securities, or ARS, at December 31, 2010. ARS are primarily AAA-rated bonds, most of which are guaranteed by the U.S. government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program through the U.S. Department of Education. During 2011, all of our remaining ARS were fully redeemed and sold. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $50.1 million to $452.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $402.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 . The change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense and a decrease in our excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, offset by a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $22.0 million to $402.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $424.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense, offset by an increase in working capital, an increase in our excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and a decrease in our provision for 31 Table of Contents deferred income taxes. We expect that cash provided by operating activities will increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues, partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions. Current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates. Net cash provided by investing activities was $171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $335.4 million of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Net cash used in investing activities was $357.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . During 2011, we had a significant increase in cash provided by investing activities due to investments maturing in which we did not reinvest in short- and long-term marketable securities. Cash provided by investing activities for 2011 reflects proceeds from sales and redemptions of short- and long-term marketable securities of $701.3 million , proceeds from maturities of short- and long-term marketable securities of $532.9 million , proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $0.2 million and a decrease in cash investments held for security deposits of $0.3 million . This was offset in part by purchases of short- and long-term marketable securities of $880.1 million , purchases of property and equipment of $182.9 million , including the capitalization of internal-use software development costs and earn out payments for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Velocitude of $0.6 million . Cash used in investing activities for 2010 reflects purchases of short- and long-term marketable securities of $1,146.5 million, purchases of property and equipment of $192.0 million, including the capitalization of internal-use software development costs, cash paid for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Velocitude of $12.7 million, and an increase in other investments of $0.5 million. Amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset, in part, by proceeds from sales and maturities of short- and long-term marketable securities of $1,015.8 million. Cash used in investing activities for 2009 reflects a $5.8 million earn-out payment associated with our purchase of acerno, purchases of short- and long-term marketable securities of $790.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $108.1 million, including the capitalization of internal-use software development costs. Amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset, in part, by proceeds from sales and maturities of short- and long-term marketable securities of $545.1 million. For 2012, we expect total capital expenditures, a component of cash used in investing activities, to be approximately 15% of total revenue for the year. We expect to fund such capital expenditures through cash generated from operations. Cash used in financing activities was $294.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $17.7 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Cash used in financing activities was $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 . Cash used in financing activities for the year-ended December 31, 2011 consisted of $324.1 million related to our 2011 common stock repurchase programs as well as $8.4 million used for taxes paid related to the net share settlements of equity awards. This amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 , which included proceeds of $25.3 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and $13.1 million related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities for the year-ended December 31, 2010 consisted of $92.4 million related to our 2010 common stock repurchase programs. This amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010, which included proceeds of $45.8 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and $29.0 million related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities for the year-ended December 31, 2009 consisted of $66.5 million related to a common stock repurchase program we initiated in April 2009. This amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009, which included proceeds of $21.7 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and $2.2 million related to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as deferred revenue, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure, including debt and equity repurchases and issuances, stock option exercises, sales of equity investments and similar events. The following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented (in millions): 32 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively $ 1,243.4 $ 1,061.5 $ 771.6 Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Receipts from customers 1,160.8 1,027.7 893.0 Payments to vendors (619.3 ) (556.4 ) (383.6 ) Payments for employee payroll (291.3 ) (247.3 ) (204.1 ) Common stock repurchases (324.1 ) (92.4 ) (66.5 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on marketable investments and other investment-related assets, net 12.8 6.5 20.0 Debt interest and premium payments (1.3 ) (2.0 ) Stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances 25.3 45.8 21.7 Cash used in business acquisitions (0.6 ) (12.7 ) (5.8 ) Employee taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (8.4 ) Legal settlements, net 8.0 Interest income 10.7 12.2 15.6 Other 12.7 (0.2 ) 1.6 Net (decrease) increase (13.4 ) 181.9 289.9 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively $ 1,230.0 $ 1,243.4 $ 1,061.5 We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months. Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2011 , for the next five years and thereafter (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 12 Months 12 to 36 Months 36 to 60 Months More than 60 Months Real estate operating leases $ 138.8 $ 23.4 $ 61.4 $ 28.2 $ 25.8 Bandwidth and co-location agreements 102.4 88.8 13.5 0.1 Open vendor purchase orders 56.0 56.0 Total contractual obligations $ 297.2 $ 168.2 $ 74.9 $ 28.3 $ 25.8 In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2011, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $17.2 million, which included $4.7 million of accrued interest and penalties. We do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2012. We are not, however, able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations. Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding $5.5 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third-party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. These irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until December 2019. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising 33 Table of Contents from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements. Litigation We are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. Management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See Legal Proceedings elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion on litigation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standard update for business combinations specifically related to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations. This guidance specifies that pro forma disclosures should be reported as if the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period, and the pro forma disclosures must include a description of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments. This standard was effective for business combinations with an acquisition date of January 1, 2011 or later. The adoption of the guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and international financial reporting standards. The guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. This standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and will be applied prospectively. The adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income, or OCI, as part of the statement of changes in equity. Under the amended guidance, all changes in OCI are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. The changes will be effective January 1, 2012 and early adoption is permitted. There will be no impact on our consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation. In September 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance that will simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amended guidance, after assessment of certain qualitative factors, if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, entities must perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the quantitative test(s) are optional. The guidance is effective January 1, 2012 with early adoption permitted. We intend to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2012. The adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 34 Table of Contents
