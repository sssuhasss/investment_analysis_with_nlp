ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about anticipated market conditions, expected growth rates of revenues and expenses, planned asset dispositions, disposition pricing, planned acquisitions, developments and renovations, property financings, expected interest rates, joint venture activity and planned capital expenditures. Although Mid-America believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Mid-America or any other person that the objectives and plans of Mid-America will be achieved. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon Mid-America consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires Mid-America to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, Mid-America evaluates our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Mid-America believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 25 Mid-America believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most subjective judgments, form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Revenue recognition Mid-America leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned. We record all gains and losses on sales of real estate in accordance with Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate . Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets Mid-America carries real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and 1 year for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by Mid-America in order to elevate the condition of the property to Mid-America standards are capitalized as incurred. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill Mid-America accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , or Statement 144, and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or Statement 142. Mid-America evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in Mid-America fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. Mid-America periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors. In accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. 26 Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, Mid-America determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. Mid-America determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141, Business Combinations . The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments Mid-America utilizes certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with Mid-America variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. The valuation of the derivative financial instruments under Statement No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended, requires Mid-America to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While Mid-America calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by Mid-America before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated. Mid-America measures ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 Mid-America results for 2007 were positively influenced by both improved operating performance from communities held throughout both the current and prior period, or same store, and the positive impact from acquisitions in recent years. Implementation of new operating platform systems is helping us to optimize the balance between increased occupancy and rental rates. 27 Mid-America has grown externally during the past three years by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Mid-America acquired three properties in 2005 and six properties in 2006, for which we benefited from full years of revenues in 2007. Mid-America also acquired an additional four communities during 2007. Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream is one property disposition in 2005 and dispositions of four properties during 2007. The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Mid-America for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2007, the total number of apartment units Mid-America owned or had an ownership interest in was 40,248 in 137 communities, compared to 40,293 apartment units in 138 communities at December 31, 2006, and 38,227 apartment units in 132 communities at December 31, 2005. For communities owned 100% by Mid-America, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $743 at December 31, 2007 from $726 at December 31, 2006, and $695 at December 31, 2005. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was 94.7%, 94.2%, and 94.6%, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by approximately $29.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2006, due to (i) an $11.5 million increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2006, or the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) a $4.8 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2007, or the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) a $0.8 million increase in property revenues from our development communities, and (iv) a $12.4 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by an average 2.5% increase in average rent per unit in 2007 over 2006. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by approximately $9.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $5.0 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $2.1 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million from our development communities, and (iv) $2.5 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of Mid-America same store portfolio and represented an average 2.9% increase over prior year expenses. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $7.3 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $3.3 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $1.2 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million from our development communities, (iv) $0.7 million from the amortization of the fair market value of leases of acquired communities, and (v) $1.8 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods. 28 Property management expenses increased by approximately $4.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2006, to the year ended December 31, 2007, partially due to increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance, increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes, and implementation expenses associated with improved operating systems. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.9 million over this same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to improved performance. Interest expense increased approximately $1.3 million in 2007 from 2006 due primarily to the approximate $42.4 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2006 due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. The impact from the increase in the average debt outstanding was partially offset by a decrease in the average annual borrowing costs from 5.5% for 2006 to 5.4% in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $5.4 million from the sale of a community owned by a joint venture of Mid-America. The sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to Mid-America of approximately $1.0 million in 2007. In 2007, Mid-America also benefited from a $9.2 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by Mid-America. Mid-America had no dispositions in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Mid-America recorded gains of $0.1 million for these same items. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income increased by approximately $19.0 million in 2007 over 2006. COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased by approximately $30.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2005, due to (i) a $9.5 million increase in property revenues from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) a $5.3 million increase in property revenues from the three properties acquired in 2005, or the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) a $15.2 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by an average 3.1% increase in average rent per unit in 2006 over 2005. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased by approximately $11.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $4.6 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $2.1 million from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) $4.5 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by an increase in property insurance reflecting the increase in premiums effective July 1, 2006. The same store property operating expense increase also reflects increased utility rates as Mid-America experienced an increase in electricity, natural gas and water and sewer prices. 29 Depreciation expense increased by approximately $4.9 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $2.7 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $1.2 million from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) $2.0 million from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.0 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of acquired communities. Property management expenses increased by approximately $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2005, to the year ended December 31, 2006, partially due to increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance and increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.2 million over this same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to improved performance. Interest expense increased approximately $5.0 million in 2006 from 2005 due primarily to the approximate $49.7 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2005 due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. Interest expense was also impacted by an increase in the average annual borrowing costs from 5.2% in 2005 to 5.5% in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $3.0 million from the sale of two communities owned by a joint venture of Mid-America. The sales of these communities resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to Mid-America of approximately $1.7 million in 2005. Mid-America had no dispositions in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Mid-America recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $0.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Mid-America recorded gains of $1.1 million for these same items. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income increased by approximately $1.2 million in 2006 over 2005. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in operating partnership income, gains on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, Mid-America has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation. Mid-America's policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. 30 FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Mid-America believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Mid-America's operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. Mid-America believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Mid-America calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 (dollars and shares in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net income $ 39,946 $ 20,945 $ 19,744 Depreciation of real estate assets 84,916 77,521 72,571 Net gain on insurance and other settlement proceeds (589 ) (84 ) (749 ) Gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities (5,388 ) (3,034 ) Net loss on insurance and other settlement proceeds of discontinued operations 25 Depreciation of real estate assets of discontinued operations 133 687 1,133 Gain on sale of discontinued operations (9,164 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of unconsolidated entities 15 500 482 Preferred dividend distribution (13,688 ) (13,962 ) (14,329 ) Minority interest in operating partnership income 3,510 1,590 1,571 Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock (589 ) Funds from operations $ 99,102 $ 87,197 $ 77,414 Weighted average shares and units: Basic 27,777 25,979 24,025 Diluted 27,943 26,204 24,227 FFO increases for both 2007 over 2006, and 2006 over 2005 were principally the result of improved community operations from Mid-America same store portfolio and the addition of communities from the 2005 acquisitions, 2006 acquisitions and 2007 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. TRENDS In 2007, rental demand for apartments continued to improve throughout most of Mid-America markets. Both our High Growth and our Growth and Income markets reported same-store revenue growth for the year averaging over 5% and NOI growth averaging 6.9%. Exceptional performers were markets in Texas and Tennessee. Following several years of rapid growth, markets in Florida did not perform as well. 31 The following chart shows performance by some of the larger markets in each of Mid-America same-store portfolio groups, averaged for the year: Revenue (1) NOI (1) Total High Growth 4.9 % 7.2 % Dallas 7.0 % 15.2 % Atlanta 4.2 % 3.6 % Houston 7.5 % 14.4 % Nashville 6.1 % 9.8 % Greenville 4.7 % 7.6 % Tampa 0.8 % 0.3 % Total Growth and Income 5.0 % 5.7 % Memphis 8.1 % 11.9 % Jacksonville 0.7 % -0.3 % Austin 7.7 % 15.3 % Jackson, MS 5.2 % 5.7 % Chattanooga 5.5 % 7.9 % Augusta 6.2 % 7.3 % Total Stable 3.5 % 3.7 % Columbus, GA -0.9 % -4.3 % Lexington, KY 7.5 % 9.8 % Total Same Store 4.6 % 5.8 % (1) Revenues and NOI by market and market group are presented before the impact of straight-line adjustments. The total same store results include the revenue adjustments. Job formation, which is the primary driver of demand by apartment residents, continued to be strong in most of our markets. On the supply side, new apartment construction continued to be limited, as in most markets, rents have yet to rise sufficiently to offset the rapid run-up of costs of new construction over the last five years. Competition from condominiums reverting back to being rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in most of our markets because most of our markets and submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes: we have avoided committing a lot of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We are seeing rental competition from condominiums and single family houses in only a few submarkets. The primary reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house, but we have seen the number drop over the past six months from approximately 28% of move-outs to approximately 26%. Analysts point out that homeownership increased from 65% to almost 69% of households over the past ten years, driven primarily by the availability of new mortgage products, many requiring no down-payment and minimal credit reporting. With a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more traditional standards, it is possible that a long-term correction will occur, and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels. This could be quite significant for the apartment business, and we believe, if this occurs, it could benefit us for several years. 32 While it seems possible that we will face slower economic growth as a result of reduced liquidity in the economy, we think that the supply of new apartments is not excessive, and that positive absorption of apartments will occur for most of our markets for the next two or three years. Should the economy fall into recession, the limited new supply of apartments and the more controlled competition from single family housing should ameliorate the impact. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $17.0 million to $117.9 million for 2007, compared to $100.9 million for 2006, mainly related to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2007. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $2.1 million to $100.9 million for 2006 compared to $98.8 million for 2005 mainly related to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2006. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $131.5 million from $239.6 million in 2006 to $108.1 million in 2007. Net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately $133.2 million from $106.4 million in 2005 to $239.6 million in 2006. The change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity. A total of approximately $88.6 million was invested in 2007 to acquire properties, this compares to approximately $195.0 million in 2006, and $105.6 million in 2005. Mid-America began limited development activities in 2006, which used net cash of approximately $10.9 million in 2006 and $14.6 million in 2007. Mid-America also expanded our renovation activities using net cash of approximately $0.4 million in 2005, $6.1 million in 2006 and $11.3 million in 2007. Finally, Mid-America net cash used in investing activities was influenced by different levels of dispositions across the three years. In 2007, Mid-America received $29.3 million from real estate dispositions, compared to $2.1 million in 2006 and $9.7 million in 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately $128.3 million to $1.9 million in 2007 from $130.1 million in 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately $117.6 million to $130.1 million in 2006 from $12.5 million in 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities was mainly impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2006 to approximately $151.9 million primarily due to Mid-America raising of funds through stock issuances from our direct stock purchase plan, a controlled equity plan and an overnight offering. During 2005 and 2007, Mid-America was not as active in raising funds through these equity plans. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was also impacted by the redemption of our 9 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series F, for $11.9 million. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2007, for the $1.3 billion of debt outstanding was 5.4% compared to 5.6% on $1.2 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2006. Mid-America utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages and secured credit facilities. Mid-America utilizes fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on Mid-America borrowings are disclosed in the schedule found later in this section. 33 At December 31, 2007, Mid-America had secured credit facilities relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie MAC, and a group of banks led by Regions Financial Corporation. Together, these credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007, with an availability to borrow of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2007, Mid-America had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.1 billion. Approximately 72% of Mid-America outstanding obligations at December 31, 2007, were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, which we call the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $1.0 billion, most of which was available to borrow at December 31, 2007. Various traunches of the facilities mature from 2008 through 2014. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate on the date of renewal, which has typically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.05% - 0.09% over the life of the FNMA facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62% to 0.795%. Recently, however, the spread between three-month LIBOR and DMBS has increased up to 0.57%. While we feel the current liquidity market is an anomaly and believe that this spread will return to more historic levels, Mid-America cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change. Each of Mid-America secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If Mid-America were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect Mid-America liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if Mid-America were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on Mid-America. On May 26, 2005, Mid-America gave the required one year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of its 8 5/8% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series G, on May 26, 2006, for the total redemption price of $10 million. As a result, in accordance with Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity , Mid-America classified the Series G as a liability within notes payable as of May 26, 2005, on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. On May 26, 2006, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series G. On October 16, 2007, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series F for the total redemption price of $11.9 million. As of December 31, 2007, Mid-America had interest rate swaps in effect totaling a notional amount of approximately $756 million. To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. Mid-America had also entered into two forward swaps as of December 31, 2007, with a total combined notional amount of $50 million. Mid-America had interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $47 million in effect as of December 31, 2007. 34 Summary details of the debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 follows in the table below (dollars in thousands): Outstanding Balance/ Average Average Average Line Line Notional Interest Rate Contract Limit Availability Amount Rate Maturity Maturity COMBINED DEBT Fixed Rate or Swapped Conventional $ 918,060 5.6 % 12/8/2011 12/8/2011 Tax Exempt 73,205 4.5 % 3/8/2013 3/8/2013 Subtotal Fixed Rate or Swapped 991,265 5.5 % 1/11/2012 1/11/2012 Variable Rate Conventional 221,474 5.1 % 2/29/2008 12/16/2012 Tax Exempt 4,760 4.4 % 12/31/2007 6/1/2028 Conventional - Capped 17,936 5.3 % 11/13/2009 11/13/2009 Tax Exempt - Capped 29,185 4.1 % 3/26/2011 3/26/2011 Subtotal Variable Rate 273,355 5.0 % 2/23/2008 6/8/2013 Total Combined Debt Outstanding $ 1,264,620 5.4 % 3/10/2011 5/1/2012 UNDERLYING DEBT Individual Property Mortgages/Bonds Conventional Fixed Rate $ 133,059 4.8 % 9/11/2013 9/11/2013 Tax Exempt Fixed Rate 11,875 5.2 % 12/1/2028 12/1/2028 Tax Exempt Variable Rate 4,760 4.4 % 12/31/2007 6/1/2028 FNMA Credit Facilities Tax Free Borrowings $ 90,515 $ 90,515 90,515 4.1 % 1/15/2008 3/1/2014 Conventional Borrowings Fixed Rate Borrowings 90,000 90,000 90,000 7.5 % 7/1/2009 7/1/2009 Variable Rate Borrowings 863,914 847,234 725,318 5.1 % 2/29/2008 6/20/2013 Subtotal FNMA Facilities 1,044,429 1,027,749 905,833 5.2 % 4/13/2008 2/21/2013 Freddie Mac Credit Facilities 300,000 167,129 167,129 5.0 % 3/1/2008 9/24/2012 Regions Credit Facility 50,000 42,794 2,404 6.6 % 1/31/2008 5/24/2008 Regions Bank 39,560 6.1 % 2/29/2008 4/1/2009 Total Underlying Debt Outstanding $ 1,264,620 5.2 % 1/9/2009 3/21/2013 HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Interest Rate Swaps LIBOR indexed $ 695,000 5.5 % 11/11/2011 Forward LIBOR indexed 50,000 5.1 % 11/30/2012 BMA indexed 61,330 4.4 % 2/20/2010 Total Interest Rate Swaps $ 806,330 5.4 % 10/18/2011 Interest Rate Caps LIBOR indexed $ 17,936 6.2 % 11/13/2009 BMA indexed 29,185 6.0 % 3/26/2011 Total Interest Rate Caps $ 47,121 6.1 % 9/17/2010 During 2007, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 120,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $6 million in proceeds. During 2006, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 1,340,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $77 million in proceeds. During 2005, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 784,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $32 million in proceeds. 35 In May 2006, Mid-America sold 1,150,000 shares of common stock through a public offering generating net proceeds of approximately $59.5 million. During the first two quarters of 2007, Mid-America sold 323,700 shares of common stock through our continuous equity offering program generating approximately $18.8 million in net proceeds. In December 2006, Mid-America sold 194,000 shares of common stock through this same program generating approximately $11.4 million in net proceeds. Mid-America believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations and annual refurbishment of our communities through our cash flow and credit facilities. Mid-America is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of FNMA, which provides credit enhancement for approximately $906 million of Mid-America debt. The interest rate market for FNMA DMBS, which in Mid-America experience is highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, is also an important component of Mid-America liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. In the event that the FNMA DMBS market becomes less efficient, or the credit of FNMA becomes impaired, Mid-America would seek alternative sources of debt financing. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering improvements to existing real estate assets (excluding renovations), distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $4.1 million. This compares to a shortfall in 2006 of approximately $4.5 million and excess coverage in 2005 of approximately $3.1 million. While Mid-America has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates, from time-to-time Mid-America may utilize additional borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary. Any significant deterioration in operations could result in Mid-America financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event Mid-America would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects Mid-America total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in 000 s): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt (1) $ 112,790 $ 106,292 $ 121,828 $ 216,962 $ 42,036 $ 664,712 $ 1,264,620 Operating Lease 9 7 7 6 5 34 Total $ 112,799 $ 106,299 $ 121,835 $ 216,968 $ 42,041 $ 664,712 $ 1,264,654 (1) Represents principal payments. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2007, and 2006, Mid-America did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Mid-America two joint ventures with Crow Holdings (one terminated in 2005 and one in 2007) were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance Mid-America return on investment through the generation of fee income. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. In addition, Mid-America does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, Mid-America is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 36 Mid-America does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with Mid-America or our related parties other than what is disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14. Mid-America investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as Mid-America does not have a controlling interest. INSURANCE Mid-America renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2007. Management believes that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced would not have a significant impact on Mid-America liquidity, financial position or results of operation. Management expects to obtain a reduction in annual policy premiums of approximately $1.5 million from the renegotiated programs when compared to the higher rates experienced after the July 1, 2006 renewal. INFLATION Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable Mid-America to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to Mid-America of the adverse effects of inflation. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , or FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . Mid-America adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken in tax returns. Mid-America has identified and examined our tax positions, including our status as a real estate investment trust, for all open tax years through December 31, 2006, and concluded that the full benefit of each tax position taken should be recognized in the financial statements. There are no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits that are reasonably likely to occur within the twelve months following the adoption date. FIN 48 requires that an enterprise must calculate interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The decision regarding where to classify interest and penalties on the income statement is an accounting policy decision that should be consistently applied. Interest and penalties calculated on any future uncertain tax positions will be presented as a component of income tax expense. No interest and penalties are accrued under FIN 48 on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. Mid-America tax years that remain subject to examination for U.S. federal purposes range from 2003 through 2006. Our tax years that remain open for state examination vary but range from 2002 through 2006. 37 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 Fair Value Measurements , or Statement 157. Statement 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2 Effective Date of FASB Statement 157 , or FSP 157-2, delays the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For these items, the effective date will be for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Mid-America does not believe the adoption of Statement 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations , or Statement 141R. Statement 141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under Statement 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Statement 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition costs which will generally be expensed as incurred. This will have a material impact on the way Mid-America accounts for property acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on Mid-America financial statements. Statement 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51 , or Statement 160. Statement 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. Statement 160 clarifies that changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. This will impact the financial statement presentation of Mid-America by requiring the minority interests in the operating partnership to be presented as a non-controlling interest as a component of equity. Statement 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
