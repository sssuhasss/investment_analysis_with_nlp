Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this report in Item 8, and the Risk Factors information, which are set forth in Item 1A. Overview Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is among the world largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Anadarko primary line of business is the exploration, development, production, gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company major areas of operations are located in the United States and Algeria, with additional activity in Brazil, China, Ghana, Indonesia, Mozambique and several other countries. Anadarko achieved its key operational objectives in 2008, during a year marked by a downturn in the financial markets and a volatile commodity-price environment that included New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) oil prices rising to highs above $140 per barrel, and falling to lows under $40 per barrel. The Company is managing its 2009 capital program consistent with a sustained lower-commodity-price environment. Anadarko ended 2008 with approximately $2.4 billion of cash on hand and retains the availability of its undrawn $1.3 billion revolving credit agreement (RCA), along with access to credit markets. Management expects this liquidity position and cash flow from operations to position the Company to meet its 2009 operational objectives and capital commitments. Mission and Strategy Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: Identify and commercialize resources Explore in high-potential, proven basins Employ global business development approach Ensure financial discipline and flexibility The first portion of this strategy involves Anadarko developing its portfolio of primarily unconventional resources that give the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable and repeatable development opportunities to consistently grow the Company at competitive rates. Exploring in high-potential, proven and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with differential growth. Anadarko exploration success creates value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to discover and develop world-class resources that are accretive to the Company performance. These resources help form an optimized-global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investments in its businesses to manage through commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic and tactical-growth opportunities. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Highlights The Company overcame significant weather events and third-party-related infrastructure issues in 2008 to achieve production growth, reserve additions, and production replacement. Significant operational highlights by area include: United States Onshore Achieved record production in the Rocky Mountain region Secured additional takeaway and processing capacity in the Rockies region Expanded acreage position and began testing prospects in the Haynesville and Marcellus shale plays, located in East Texas and central Pennsylvania, respectively, as well as the Maverick basin in South Texas Gulf of Mexico Announced a successful appraisal well at Tonga West and approved the Caesar/Tonga complex All Anadarko-operated facilities successfully weathered two major hurricanes with only minor, localized surface damage; however some production remained curtailed due to third-party pipeline and infrastructure issues Restored production to pre-shut-in levels at Independence Hub within 72 hours of Hurricane Ike Restored production on June 16, 2008 to nearly a billion cubic feet per day of natural gas at Independence Hub after a ten-week shut-in due to a third-party export pipeline leak International Announced major discoveries and successful appraisal wells offshore Ghana in and near the Jubilee field Announced the Company first pre-salt discovery in the Campos basin offshore Brazil at the Wahoo prospect Achieved 1-billion-barrel production milestone in Algeria Acquired six blocks in the West Africa Cretaceous trend located in Sierra Leone and Liberia Financial Highlights The Company 2008 financial highlights include: Generated $6.4 billion of cash flow from continuing operating activities compared to $2.8 billion in 2007 due to higher commodity prices Announced a $5 billion share repurchase program and completed $600 million of repurchases in the third quarter of 2008 Completed an initial public offering through the issuance of 20.8 million common units of its formerly wholly-owned midstream subsidiary, WES, for net proceeds of $321 million Closed the divestitures of the Company interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil and the Kaskida discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for before-tax proceeds of approximately $1.8 billion Reduced year-end debt-to-capital ratio to 39.6%. Reduced debt by $2.4 billion in 2008, including repayment of the Company 2006 acquisition financing and approximately $580 million of floating rate notes due in 2009 Closed 2008 with $2.4 billion of cash on hand Operated in a volatile commodity-price environment that included NYMEX oil prices rising to highs above $140 per barrel, and falling to lows under $40 per barrel 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following discussion pertains to Anadarko financial condition, results of operations and changes in financial condition. Unless noted otherwise, the following information relates to continuing operations and excludes the discontinued Canadian operations. The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include, among other things, commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, production volumes, the Company ability to find additional oil and natural gas reserves, as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko or Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

(2) Anadarko financial and operating results for 2006 include the operating results of Kerr-McGee and Western since the dates of their acquisitions on August 10, 2006, and August 23, 2006, respectively. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financial Results Income from Continuing Operations Anadarko income from continuing operations for 2008 totaled $3.2 billion, or $6.84 per share (diluted), compared to income from continuing operations for 2007 of $3.8 billion, or $8.05 per share (diluted). Anadarko had income from continuing operations in 2006 of $2.5 billion, or $5.33 per share (diluted). The decrease in income from continuing operations for 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in gains on divestitures and higher costs and expenses, partially offset by higher natural gas, oil and NGLs sales, including the impact of derivatives, lower interest expense and lower income tax expense. The increase in 2007 income from continuing operations compared to 2006 was primarily due to gains on divestitures and higher sales volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower natural gas and oil and condensate prices, higher costs and expenses, including other taxes related to an Algerian exceptional profits tax, and higher interest expense. In 2008, the higher sales revenues and costs and expenses were due primarily to the impact of higher commodity prices, higher exploration expense related to impairments of unproved properties and higher other taxes related to the higher commodity prices. In 2007, the higher sales volumes and costs and expenses were due primarily to the impact of operations acquired with the third quarter 2006 acquisitions. Sales Revenues D vs. D vs. millions except percentages 2008 2007 2008 2006 2007 Gas sales $ 6,254 $ 4,119 52 % $ 4,186 (2 )% Oil and condensate sales 6,502 4,807 35 4,618 4 Natural gas liquids sales 802 719 12 594 21 Gathering, processing and marketing sales 1,082 1,487 (27 ) 718 107 Total $ 14,640 $ 11,132 32 $ 10,116 10 Anadarko sales revenues for 2008 increased when compared to 2007 due to higher oil and condensate, natural gas and NGLs commodity prices and unrealized gains on derivatives, partially offset by lower sales volumes associated with properties that were divested in 2007. The increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by significantly lower natural gas and oil and condensate prices. The Company sales revenues for 2008, 2007 and 2006 include $930 million, $(1,100) million and $895 million, respectively, related to net unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives used to manage price risk on natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs sales. The significant fluctuations in unrealized gains (losses) are due primarily to an increase in Anadarko derivative portfolio as a result of the 2006 acquisition of Kerr-McGee, as well as the discontinuance of hedge accounting effective January 1, 2007. The majority of the unrealized gains recorded in 2006 related to derivatives assumed with the Kerr-McGee acquisition. Any realization of these gains or losses is expected to be substantially offset by the value realized from that portion of the Company production covered by the derivative instruments. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Analysis of Oil and Gas Operations Sales Revenues The following table provides a summary of the effects of changes in volumes, prices and derivatives gains and losses on Anadarko sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006. millions Natural Gas Oil and Condensate NGLs 2006 sales revenues $ 4,186 $ 4,618 $ 594 Changes associated with sales volumes 858 481 26 Changes in prices, excluding derivatives (282 ) 659 108 Changes in realized derivative gains and losses 331 (40 ) (9 ) Changes in unrealized derivative gains and losses (974 ) (911 ) 2007 sales revenues $ 4,119 $ 4,807 $ 719 Changes associated with sales volumes 300 (802 ) (63 ) Changes in prices, excluding derivatives 1,436 1,838 146 Changes in realized derivative gains and losses (368 ) (514 ) Changes in unrealized derivative gains and losses 767 1,173 2008 sales revenues $ 6,254 $ 6,502 $ 802 The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk of a decrease in the market prices for its anticipated sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. This activity is referred to as price risk management. The impact of price risk management (including realized and unrealized gains and losses) increased revenues $586 million in 2008, decreased revenues $472 million in 2007 and increased revenues $1,131 million in 2006.

The sales volume increase in the Gulf of Mexico was realized despite prolonged repairs of third-party downstream infrastructure at the end of 2008 as a result of the 2008 hurricane activity. Volumes in Algeria decreased 7 MBOE/d primarily as a result of lower production due to maintenance, a statutory shutdown and current production constraints implemented by OPEC in the fourth quarter of 2008. During 2007, Anadarko daily sales volumes increased compared to 2006 primarily due to higher sales volumes of 138 MBOE/d 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements associated with the full-period impact of the 2006 acquisitions and higher sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 18 MBOE/d associated with production start up at Independence Hub in the second half of 2007, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 64 MBOE/d associated with the impact of 2007 divestitures in the onshore United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Qatar. Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future. Natural Gas Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2008 2007 D vs. 2008 2006 D vs. 2007 (Percentages) (Percentages) United States Sales volumes Bcf 750 698 7 % 558 25 % MMcf/d 2,049 1,912 7 1,529 25 Price per Mcf, excluding derivatives $ 7.65 $ 5.74 33 $ 6.14 (7 ) Realized gains (losses) on derivatives 0.19 0.73 (74 ) 0.33 121 7.84 6.47 21 6.47 Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives 0.50 (0.57 ) 188 1.03 (155 ) Total $ 8.34 $ 5.90 41 $ 7.50 (21 ) Gas sales revenues (millions) $ 6,254 $ 4,119 52 $ 4,186 (2 ) The Company daily natural gas sales volumes increased in 2008 compared to 2007, excluding 2007 divested property volumes of 156 MMcf/d, primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 175 MMcf/d as a result of the start up of the Independence Hub and increased production in the Rockies of 162 MMcf/d due to improved drilling efficiencies allowing for more overall drilling, partially offset by decreased production in the Southern Region of 44 MMcf/d. Anadarko daily natural gas sales volumes in 2007 increased when compared to 2006. The increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes associated with the 2006 acquisitions of 491 MMcf/d and higher sales volumes of 106 MMcf/d in the Gulf of Mexico related to the start up of the Independence Hub, partially offset by decreases in sales volumes of 224 MMcf/d associated with 2007 divestitures in the onshore United States and Gulf of Mexico. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. Excluding the impact of gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average natural gas price for 2008 increased when compared to 2007. The relative difference in 2008 and 2007 prices is primarily attributable to strong prices in the first half of 2008. The strong price in 2008 stemmed from lower year-over-year natural gas storage volumes coupled with lower liquefied natural gas volumes available to the United States consumer, both of which were caused principally by increased demand and pricing in both Europe and Asia. Excluding the impact of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average natural gas price for 2007 decreased when compared to 2006. The lower natural gas price is attributable to a higher than average North America natural gas storage level in 2007, the full year effect in 2007 of the return of Gulf of Mexico gas production capacity in 2006 that was damaged during the 2005 hurricane season and a significant increase in liquefied natural gas supply into the United States. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has implemented price risk management on about 24% of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes for 2009. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Crude Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues D vs. D vs. 2008 2007 2008 2006 2007 (Percentages) (Percentages) United States Sales volumes MMBbls 40 48 (17 )% 39 23 % MBbls/d 108 130 (17 ) 108 20 Price per barrel, excluding derivatives $ 96.20 $ 66.64 44 $ 59.41 12 Realized gains (losses) on derivatives (8.15 ) 1.35 (704 ) 2.64 (49 ) 88.05 67.99 30 62.05 10 Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives 8.18 (10.75 ) 176 6.54 (264 ) Total $ 96.23 $ 57.24 68 $ 68.59 (17 ) Algeria Sales volumes MMBbls 21 24 (13 ) 23 4 MBbls/d 58 65 (11 ) 64 2 Price per barrel, excluding derivatives $ 98.99 $ 75.50 31 $ 65.55 15 Realized gains (losses) on derivatives (5.86 ) NM NM 93.13 75.50 23 65.55 15 Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives 9.14 (5.91 ) 255 NM Total $ 102.27 $ 69.59 47 $ 65.55 6 Other International Sales volumes MMBbls 6 7 (14 ) 8 (13 ) MBbls/d 16 20 (20 ) 21 (5 ) Total average price per barrel $ 85.51 $ 59.91 43 $ 48.58 23 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 67 79 (15 ) 70 13 MBbls/d 182 215 (15 ) 193 11 Total price per barrel, excluding derivatives $ 96.15 $ 68.68 40 $ 60.28 14 Realized gains (losses) on derivatives (6.72 ) 0.82 (920 ) 1.48 (45 ) 89.43 69.50 29 61.76 13 Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives 7.78 (8.31 ) 194 3.67 (326 ) Total $ 97.21 $ 61.19 59 $ 65.43 (7 ) Total oil and condensate sales revenues (millions) $ 6,502 $ 4,807 35 $ 4,618 4 NM not meaningful Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes were lower in 2008 compared to 2007, excluding 2007 divested property volumes of 15 MBbls/d, primarily due to lower crude oil sales volumes of 13 MBbls/d in the Gulf of Mexico due to 2008 hurricane activity, lower crude oil sales volumes of 7 MBbls/d in Algeria, primarily as a result of lower production due to maintenance, a statutory shutdown and current production constraints implemented by OPEC in the fourth quarter of 2008, and lower crude oil sales volumes of 3 MBbls/d in Alaska, partially offset by higher crude oil sales volumes of 5 MBbls/d in the Rockies. Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2007 were up when compared to the same period of 2006. The increases in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of 48 MBbls/d associated with the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 20 MBbls/d associated with 2007 divestitures in the onshore United States, the Gulf of Mexico and Qatar and a decrease in Venezuelan sales volumes due to contract changes in late 2006. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand. Excluding the impact of gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average crude oil price for 2008 increased when compared to 2007. Crude oil prices were strong in the first half of 2008, primarily due to limited excess production capacity, heightened geopolitical tension and increased demand in Asia; particularly China and 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements India. Excluding the impact of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, Anadarko average crude oil price for 2007 increased when compared to 2006. The higher crude oil prices were attributed primarily to additional global demand, limited excess production capacity and heightened geopolitical tension. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has utilized price risk management on about 28% of its anticipated oil and condensate sales volumes for 2009. Natural Gas Liquids Sales Volumes, Average Prices and Revenues 2008 2007 D vs. 2008 2006 D vs. 2007 (Percentages) (Percentages) United States Sales volumes MMBbls 14 16 (13 )% 15 7 % MBbls/d 39 43 (9 ) 42 2 Price per barrel, excluding derivatives $ 56.11 $ 45.87 22 $ 39.71 16 Realized gains (losses) on derivatives 0.03 NM (0.13 ) NM 56.11 45.90 22 39.58 16 Unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives NM NM Total $ 56.11 $ 45.90 22 $ 39.58 16 Natural gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 802 $ 719 12 $ 594 21 NGLs sales represent revenues derived from the processing of Anadarko natural gas production. The Company daily NGLs sales volumes were down in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 4 MBbls/d decrease associated with the 2007 divestitures. Anadarko daily NGLs sales volumes were up in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to higher sales volumes of 8 MBbls/d associated with the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 6 MBbls/d related to the 2007 divestitures. Excluding the impact of gains and losses on derivatives, the average NGLs price increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased global petrochemical demand for the first three quarters of 2008. During 2007, average NGLs prices increased when compared to 2006 primarily due to increased petrochemical demand in 2007. NGLs production is dependent on natural gas and NGLs prices as well as the economics of processing the natural gas to extract NGLs. Production of NGLs usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand. Gathering, Processing and Marketing Revenues millions except percentages 2008 2007 D vs. 2008 2006 D vs. 2007 Gathering and processing sales $ 1,085 $ 1,259 (14 )% $ 538 134 % Marketing sales (3 ) 228 (101 ) 180 27 Total $ 1,082 $ 1,487 (27 ) $ 718 107 Gathering and processing revenues represent revenues derived from gathering and processing natural gas from sources other than the Company production. Marketing sales primarily represent the margin earned on sales of gas, oil and NGLs purchased from third parties. During 2008, gathering and processing sales decreased $174 million compared to 2007 primarily due to lower volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures, partially offset by higher product prices and gathering rates. Marketing sales decreased $231 million during 2008 primarily due to lower margins on firm transportation contracts, write-down of storage inventory due to lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 and less third-party marketing activity. During 2007, gathering and processing sales increased $721 million compared to 2006 due to gathering and processing operations acquired with the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease associated with divestitures in 2007. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other, net Gains on divestitures in 2008 were $1.2 billion, primarily related to the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in Brazil, onshore in the United States and the Gulf of Mexico, in several unrelated transactions. Gains on divestitures in 2007 related primarily to the Company asset realignment program. During 2007, net gains of $4.1 billion related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and net gains of $0.6 billion related to the divestiture of certain gathering and processing interests that were not affiliated with the Company operating areas. Gains on divestitures in 2006 were $26 million. For additional information, see Acquisitions and Divestitures below . In 2008, gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net includes a net $82 million ($52 million after tax) reduction related to corrections resulting from analysis of property records after the adoption of the successful efforts method of accounting. This net amount includes a reduction of $163 million related to 2007. Management concluded that this misstatement was not material relative to 2007 interim and annual results, or to the 2008 periods, and corrected the error in the first quarter of 2008. Costs and Expenses millions except percentages 2008 2007 D vs. 2008 2006 D vs. 2007 Oil and gas operating $ 1,104 $ 1,101 % $ 822 34 % Oil and gas transportation and other 553 453 22 341 33 Exploration 1,369 905 51 737 23 Gathering, processing and marketing 800 1,025 (22 ) 553 85 General and administrative 866 936 (7 ) 768 22 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,194 2,840 12 1,752 62 Other taxes 1,452 1,234 18 549 125 Impairments 223 51 337 327 (84 ) Total $ 9,561 $ 8,545 12 $ 5,849 46 During 2008, Anadarko costs and expenses increased when compared to 2007 due to the following factors: Oil and gas operating expenses were impacted by a decrease of $111 million associated with the 2007 divestitures, a decrease in demand charges of $46 million in the Gulf of Mexico and lower insurance expenses of $20 million related to Gulf of Mexico properties, offset primarily by higher operating costs of $79 million in the Rockies, higher direct operating and third-party expense of $63 million in the Gulf of Mexico and gas processing fees of $31 million in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily associated with the startup of Independence Hub in July 2007. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased primarily due to higher transportation charges in the Rockies and Southern Region, higher surface owner payments in the Rockies and due to expenses associated with the Independence Hub startup in July 2007. Exploration expense increased $464 million primarily due to a $337 million impairment of unproved properties in the Gulf of Mexico, a $55 million impairment of unproved properties in Trinidad, a $40 million impairment of unproved properties in Brazil, and a $34 million increase in geological and geophysical costs, primarily in Mozambique. Gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) expenses decreased $225 million. Costs associated with gathering and processing operations decreased $183 million primarily due to 2007 divestitures and a reduction of accrued expenses related to a prior period of $29 million, partially offset by an increase in cost of product due to higher prices and direct operating costs. Marketing transportation costs decreased $39 million. General and administrative (G&A) expense decreased primarily due to a $42 million decrease in employee severance and termination benefits, lower compensation expense of $39 million and a decrease of $16 million in contract labor expense, partially offset by higher benefit plans expense of $33 million. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased in 2008. DD&A expense associated with oil and gas properties increased approximately $416 million due to higher costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $43 million due to lower sales volumes and a decrease in depreciation of other properties and equipment of $28 million primarily due to divestitures. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased production and severance taxes of $194 million related primarily to higher commodity prices, increases associated with the effects of a windfall profits tax in China of $55 million and increased ad valorem taxes of $43 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the Algerian exceptional profits tax expense primarily attributable to a change in the estimate of the 2006 exceptional profits tax recognized in the first quarter of 2007. Impairments of $113 million, $98 million and $12 million in 2008 were related to Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment properties in the United States, Midstream segment assets and Marketing segment assets, respectively. The Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment and Midstream segment impairments were primarily a result of lower commodity prices at year-end 2008. The Marketing segment impairments related to the impairment of transportation contracts. During 2007, Anadarko costs and expenses increased when compared to 2006 due to the following factors: Oil and gas operating expense increased primarily due to approximately $227 million in operating expenses on properties acquired with the 2006 acquisitions, an increase of $71 million in expenses in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico related primarily to subsurface repairs and operating costs of Independence Hub which began production in 2007, a $28 million increase in costs associated primarily with the ramp up of activity in the Rockies and an increase of approximately $20 million related to severance cost associated with the Company post-acquisition asset realignment program. These increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately $66 million associated with properties divested during 2007. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased in 2007. Transportation expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease associated with properties divested in 2007. Exploration expense increased $168 million due primarily to a $140 million increase in impairments of unproved properties, primarily associated with a significant increase in unproved leasehold interests as a result of the 2006 acquisitions, and a $28 million increase in dry hole expense related to international activities. GPM expenses increased $472 million. Costs associated with gathering and processing operations increased $389 million primarily due to facilities acquired in 2006. Marketing transportation and cost of product increased $83 million primarily due to higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions and the assumption of firm transportation contracts in 2006. G&A expense increased primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit expenses of $158 million associated primarily to rising base compensation and benefit costs for employees, higher performance-based bonus expense and an increase in the average number of employees associated with the 2006 acquisitions. DD&A expense increased in 2007. DD&A expense associated with oil and gas properties increased approximately $719 million as a result of operations acquired in 2006, approximately $367 million due to higher costs associated with acquiring, finding and developing oil and gas reserves and approximately $43 million due to higher organic sales volumes primarily associated with first production at Independence Hub in the Gulf of Mexico. Depreciation of other properties and equipment increased approximately $105 million primarily due to gathering, processing and general properties obtained with the 2006 acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $149 million related to oil and gas properties divested in 2007. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other taxes increased in 2007. Other taxes include an increase of $602 million associated with the Algerian exceptional profits tax. The remaining increase of $83 million is primarily due to the effect of higher sales volumes on production taxes, the effect of a new Alaskan severance tax, the effect of a windfall profits tax in China and higher franchise taxes. Impairments of $35 million and $16 million in 2007 were related to the Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment and the Marketing segment in the United States, respectively. Impairments in 2006 include a $166 million loss associated with the termination of the Venezuela operating service agreement in exchange for an 18% equity interest in a new operating company related to the Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment and a $139 million impairment related to the decision to suspend construction of the Company Bear Head LNG project in Nova Scotia for the Marketing segment.

The decrease was primarily due to lower average debt levels in 2008 and decreases in average floating interest rates in 2008. Anadarko gross interest expense increased during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings associated with the 2006 acquisitions and higher interest rates compared to 2006. For additional information see Acquisitions and Divestitures and Debt below and Interest Rate Risk under Item 7A of this Form 10-K. The amount of capitalized interest in 2008 is comparable to capitalized interest in 2007. In 2007, capitalized interest increased compared to 2006. This increase was primarily due to increased costs for major projects. Other (Income) Expense For 2008, the Company had total other expense of $51 million compared to total other income of $74 million for 2007. The decrease of $125 million was primarily related to lower interest income of $40 million due to lower average cash levels and lower interest rates in 2008, a $40 million loss related to environmental reserve adjustments and $54 million of impairment losses related to equity investments. For 2007, the Company had total other income of $74 million compared to $6 million for 2006. The increase of $68 million was primarily due to higher interest income of $37 million, a $22 million loss on an impaired equity investment in 2006 and a $10 million loss related to environmental reserve adjustments in 2006. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Minority Interests For 2008, the Company had minority interests expense of $23 million primarily related to the public ownership of a 36.7% limited partnership interest in WES which completed its initial public offering in the second quarter of 2008. See Master Limited Partnership Initial Public Offering below. Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2008 2007 2006 Income tax expense $ 2,148 $ 2,559 $ 1,263 Effective tax rate 40 % 40 % 34 % For 2008, income tax expense related to continuing operations decreased 16% compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes. For 2007, income tax expense related to continuing operations increased 103% compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes and variances from the statutory rate. The variance from the 35% statutory rate in 2008 is primarily attributable to the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax, which is non-deductible for Algerian income tax purposes, U.S. tax on foreign inclusions and distributions, state income taxes and other items. This increase in the 35% statutory rate is offset by a foreign tax rate applicable to the Company's divestiture of its 50% interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil, which is a rate lower than the 35% U.S. statutory rate, and other items. The variance from the 35% statutory rate in 2007 was primarily caused by the Algerian exceptional profits tax, which is non-deductible for Algerian income tax purposes, other foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rates, state income taxes and other items. For 2006, the variance from the 35% statutory rate was primarily caused by foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rates, state income taxes, excess U.S. foreign tax credits and other items. Texas House Bill 3, signed into law in May 2006, eliminates the taxable capital and earned surplus components of the existing franchise tax and replaces these components with a taxable margin tax calculated on a combined basis. The new tax is effective for reports due on or after January 1, 2008 (based on business activity during 2007). Anadarko is required to include the impact of the law change on its deferred state income taxes in income for the period which includes the date of enactment. The adjustment, a reduction in Anadarko deferred state income taxes in the amount of approximately $14 million and $69 million, net of federal benefit, was included in the 2007 and 2006 tax provision, respectively. Operating Results Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the operating results of Anadarko segments, management uses income from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A expense and impairments (Adjusted EBITDAX). Anadarko definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes exploration expense, as exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period, but is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A expense and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance, because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko financing methods or capital structure. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions to shareholders. Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Anadarko consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with income from continuing operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income from continuing operations before income taxes. Adjusted EBITDAX millions except percentages 2008 2007 D vs. 2008 2006 D vs. 2007 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 5,346 $ 6,329 (16 )% $ 3,737 69 % Exploration expense 1,369 905 51 737 23 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 3,194 2,840 12 1,752 62 Impairments 223 51 337 327 (84 ) Interest expense 742 1,092 (32 ) 650 68 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX $ 10,874 $ 11,217 (3 ) $ 7,203 56 Adjusted EBITDAX by segment Oil and gas exploration and production $ 10,917 $ 10,637 3 $ 7,350 45 Midstream 428 894 (52 ) 183 389 Marketing 39 234 (83 ) 78 200 Other and intersegment eliminations (510 ) (548 ) 7 (408 ) (34 ) Oil and Gas Exploration and Production The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the impact of higher commodity prices and higher sales volumes primarily in the Rockies and the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by a decrease in gains on divestitures and other, net of $3.1 billion and lower sales volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in gains on divestitures of $4.1 billion and higher sales volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower natural gas and oil and condensate prices and higher costs and expenses, including the Algerian exceptional profits tax. The Company sales revenues include the impact of price risk management activities (including realized and unrealized gains and losses) which increased oil and gas revenues $586 million during 2008, compared to a decrease of $472 million in 2007 and an increase of $1,131 million in 2006. Of these amounts for 2008, 2007, and 2006 $892 million, $(1,048) million, and $837 million, respectively, were related to the recognition of net unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives used to manage price risk on natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs sales. Midstream The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2008 compared to 2007 resulted primarily from a decrease in gains on divestitures and other, net of $531 million and lower volumes as a result of the 2007 divestitures, partially offset by higher product prices and gathering rates. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006 resulted primarily from an increase in gains on divestitures of $532 million related to midstream assets and an increased scope of midstream operations resulting from the 2006 acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in earnings associated with the 2007 divestitures. During July 2007, the Company divested its interests in two natural gas gathering systems and associated processing plants that did not operate in areas where Anadarko has significant oil and gas production. These divested facilities accounted for $75 million, or 21%, of Anadarko midstream segment Adjusted EBITDAX excluding gains on divestitures during 2007. Marketing Marketing earnings primarily represent the margin earned on sales of gas, oil and NGLs purchased from third parties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to lower margins on firm transportation contracts and the write-down of storage inventory due to lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006, resulted primarily from the effects of higher volumes transported as a result of the 2006 acquisitions. Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of corporate costs that are not allocated to the operating segments and income from hard minerals investments and royalties. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in employee 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements severance and termination benefits, a decrease in compensation expense, and a decrease in contract labor expense, partially offset by higher benefit plans expense and impairment losses related to equity investments. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to increases in compensation expense from the increased average number of employees associated with the 2006 acquisitions. Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions In August 2006, Anadarko acquired Kerr-McGee and Western in separate all-cash transactions. Anadarko initially financed $22.5 billion for the acquisitions through a 364-day committed acquisition facility with plans to repay it with proceeds from asset divestitures, free cash flow from operations and the issuance of equity, debt and bank financing during the term of the facility. Through February 29, 2008, the Company had repaid the initial amount financed under the acquisition facility of $22.5 billion using divestiture proceeds, long-term refinancing and cash flow from operations. Kerr-McGee Transaction On August 10, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16.5 billion, or $70.50 per share, plus the assumption of $2.6 billion of debt. Kerr-McGee legacy core properties are located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and onshore in Colorado and Utah. They include deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks which are supported by Kerr-McGee hub-and-spoke infrastructure. In Colorado, Kerr-McGee held acreage in the Wattenberg natural gas play, located largely on Anadarko Land Grant holdings, where Anadarko owns the royalty interest. In Utah, Kerr-McGee held acreage in the Uinta basin prolific Greater Natural Buttes gas play. In addition to its U.S. portfolio, Kerr-McGee produces oil and is continuing to develop and explore offshore China, has made discoveries offshore Brazil, and is exploring West Africa and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Western Transaction On August 23, 2006, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Western for $4.8 billion, or $61.00 per share, plus the assumption of $625 million of debt. Western CBM properties within the Powder River basin are directly adjacent to Anadarko assets in this developing play. Anadarko believes that combining its properties with Western accelerated the development of these natural gas resources and will produce volume growth through the end of the decade, and possibly longer, with more than 12,000 identified drilling locations in inventory. The acquisition of Western also significantly increased the Company holdings in gathering and processing systems. Divestitures As a result of a portfolio refocusing effort stemming from the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, Anadarko divested certain properties during 2007 and 2006 for approximately $17 billion before income taxes. Net proceeds from these divestitures were used to retire debt. During 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4 billion before taxes. See Discontinued Operations . On the acquisition date, Kerr-McGee other assets included approximately $1 billion of assets held for sale. The sale of these assets closed in August 2006 and the proceeds were also used to pay down debt incurred to fund the acquisitions. During 2007, the Company closed several unrelated divestiture transactions representing approximately $11 billion before income taxes. The most significant of these transactions are discussed below. In January 2007, the Company sold its interests in the Knotty Head and Big Foot oil discoveries, as well as the Big Foot North prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, for $0.9 billion. During February 2007, Anadarko also closed the sale of its Genghis Khan discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $1.3 billion. In March 2007, Anadarko divested control of its interests in 28 Permian basin oil and gas fields in West Texas for $1.0 billion (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements ), sold its Vernon and Ansley fields located in Jackson Parish, Louisiana, for $1.5 billion and sold substantially all of its interests in the Elk basin and Gooseberry area of the Northern Rockies for $0.4 billion. In April 2007, Anadarko sold its interests in the Williston basin area of the Northern Rockies for $0.4 billion. In May 2007, Anadarko sold its interests in certain natural gas properties in Oklahoma and Texas for $0.9 billion and also sold a 23% working interest in the K2 Unit in the Gulf of Mexico for $1.2 billion. Anadarko remains the K2 Unit operator with a 42% working interest. In June 2007, Anadarko sold certain of its interests in the Austin Chalk play in central and east Texas for $0.8 billion. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In July 2007, the Company divested control of its interests in the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum natural gas gathering systems and associated processing plants for $1.9 billion (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below). In October 2007, the Company divested certain interests in Qatar for approximately $350 million. In 2008, the Company divested certain oil and gas properties, primarily in Brazil, onshore in the United States and the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $2.5 billion. Proceeds from divestitures in 2008 were used to reduce debt. In April 2008, Anadarko entered into an agreement to sell a wholly-owned subsidiary, which owns an 18% interest in Petroritupano, S.A. (Petroritupano), a Venezuelan mixed company whose other shareholders are Petr leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and Petrobras Energ a, S.A., for $200 million. The closing of this transaction was subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of approvals by Venezuelan authorities. Anadarko has been informed by the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum that it will not grant approval of the sale transaction because PDVSA intends to acquire Anadarko equity interest in Petroritupano. Anadarko has subsequently received a letter from Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo, S.A. (CVP), an affiliate of PDVSA, in which CVP states its interest in acquiring Anadarko equity interest in Petroritupano. At this time, Anadarko is unable to determine when the sale to CVP may be consummated. Anadarko investment in Petroritupano is included in other assets at December 31, 2008. For additional information, see Note 2 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Proved Reserves Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability depends partially upon the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves, among other factors. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. In conjunction with the August 2006 acquisition of Kerr-McGee and Western, Anadarko implemented an asset realignment program. The goal of the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential, with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to Anadarko operations. During 2007, the Company successfully completed the majority of the divestiture stage of the realignment program. As expected, Anadarko proved reserves at the end of 2007 were about equal to levels before the acquisitions. The following discussion of proved reserves, reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves includes both continuing and discontinued operations. A breakdown of reserve information by continuing and discontinued operations is contained in the Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. MMBOE 2008 2007 2006 Proved Reserves Beginning of year 2,431 3,011 2,449 Reserve additions and revisions 188 252 1,043 Sales in place (137 ) (620 ) (287 ) Production (205 ) (212 ) (194 ) End of year 2,277 2,431 3,011 Proved Developed Reserves Beginning of year 1,625 1,989 1,524 End of year 1,600 1,625 1,989 The Company proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2008 were 8.1 Tcf compared to 8.5 Tcf at year-end 2007 and 10.5 Tcf at year-end 2006. Anadarko proved crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year-end 2008 were 0.9 billion barrels compared to 1.0 billion barrels at year-end 2007 and 1.3 billion barrels at year-end 2006. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs comprised about 41%, 42% and 42% of the Company proved reserves at year-end 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Company engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. The available data reviewed include, among other things, seismic data, structure and isopach maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data, individual well and field projections, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling. Sustained decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2008, the Company added 188 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries, improved recovery and extensions) and revisions. The Company expects the majority of future reserve adds to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in North America and the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through improved recovery operations, purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. Additions During 2008, Anadarko added 102 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as the result of successful drilling in the Rockies and developments and appraisals in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. During 2007, Anadarko added 131 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 130 MMBOE were as a result of successful drilling in CBM and conventional plays of the Rockies and the initial recognition of proved reserves at the Peregrino field in Brazil. During 2006, Anadarko added 1,118 MMBOE of proved reserves. Of this amount, 1,030 MMBOE were related to purchases in place primarily associated with the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western in August 2006. In addition, the Company added 88 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in core areas onshore in the United States. Revisions Total revisions in 2008 were 86 MMBOE or 3.5% of the beginning of year reserve base. The revisions included an increase of 188 MMBOE primarily related to the large onshore natural gas plays, such as the Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg and Pinedale fields, as a result of successful infill drilling, in addition to positive revisions to the Peregrino heavy-oil field, offshore Brazil, which was sold in 2008, partially offset by a decrease of 102 MMBOE related to prices for oil and NGLs. Total revisions for 2007 were 121 MMBOE. Revisions in 2007 related primarily to the large onshore natural gas plays such as Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Pinedale and Jonah fields, where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision, and the increase in oil and natural gas prices. Total revisions for 2006 were (75) MMBOE. Revisions in 2006 related primarily to performance revisions of (136) MMBOE mainly due to downward revisions of the Company reserves at the K2 complex in the Gulf of Mexico and adjustments in Algeria, and price revisions of (99) MMBOE primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices since the end of 2005, partially offset by additional infill drilling reserve bookings of 160 MMBOE. Sales in Place During 2008, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Brazil representing 46 MMBOE and 91 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2007, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Qatar representing 609 MMBOE and 11 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2006, the Company sold properties located in Canada representing 248 MMBOE of proved reserves. In addition, sales in place included 39 MMBOE of proved reserves related to government imposed contract changes which resulted in the Company Venezuelan properties being exchanged for an equity interest in a new Venezuela operating entity. Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2008, the present value (discounted at 10%) of future net cash flows from Anadarko proved reserves was $12.0 billion (stated in accordance with the regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This present value was calculated based on prices at year-end 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The decrease of $16.9 billion or 59% in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily due to lower commodity prices at year-end 2008. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Midstream Strategies Anadarko invests in midstream (gathering, treating and processing) facilities to complement its oil and gas operations in regions where the Company has natural gas production. The Company is better able to control the timing of development of its oil and gas properties and manage both the value received for, and cost of, gathering, treating and processing natural gas through its ownership and operation of these facilities. In addition, Anadarko midstream business provides gathering, treating and processing services for third-party customers, including major and independent producers. Anadarko generates revenues in its gathering and processing activities through various fee structures that include fixed-rate, percent of proceeds, or keep-whole agreements. The Company also processes a portion of its gas at various third-party plants. In 2006, Anadarko significantly increased the size and scope of its midstream business through the acquisitions of Western and Kerr-McGee. Anadarko has 29 systems in seven states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas) located in major producing basins of the onshore United States. In December 2007, a midstream subsidiary issued a $2.2 billion note payable to a related party. At December 31, 2008, the midstream note payable to a related party had an outstanding balance of $1.7 billion, which is guaranteed by Anadarko. See Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 and Debt below for additional information. During the second quarter of 2008, WES completed its initial public offering of 20.8 million common units for net proceeds of $321 million ($343 million less $22 million for underwriting discounts and structuring fees). WES is a Delaware limited partnership formed by Anadarko to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets. Anadarko contributed assets to WES in exchange for an aggregate 59.6% limited partner interest (consisting of common and subordinated limited partner units) in WES, a 2% general partner interest and IDRs. IDRs entitle the holder to specified increasing percentages of cash distributions as WES per-unit cash distributions increase. In addition, Anadarko maintains control over the assets owned by WES through sole indirect ownership of the general partner interests. Proceeds from the initial public offering were used to reduce debt. On December 19, 2008, WES acquired additional midstream assets from Anadarko for aggregate consideration of $210 million, consisting of a $175 million note payable to Anadarko and the issuance of 2.6 million common units of WES to Anadarko. In addition, WES issued additional general partner units to its general partner, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko, to allow it to maintain its 2% general partner interest in WES after contribution by Anadarko of its 2% undivided interest in the midstream assets. Anadarko currently holds an aggregate 61.3% limited partner interest in WES. Marketing Strategies The Company marketing department actively manages sales of its natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. The Company sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. In 2008, the Company also engaged in sales of greenhouse gas ERCs derived from CO 2 injection operations in Wyoming. The Company expects additional sales of ERCs in the future. The Company also purchases natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near Anadarko production. These purchases allow Anadarko to aggregate larger volumes, fully utilize transportation capacity, attract larger, creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to maximize prices received for the Company production and minimize balancing issues with customers and pipelines during operational disruptions. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company does not engage in market-making practices and limits its trading activities to natural gas, crude oil and NGLs commodity contracts. The Company trading risk position, typically, is a net short position that is offset by the Company natural long position as a producer. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7A of this Form 10-K. In an effort to protect the Company from commodity price risk stemming from the 2006 acquisitions, the Company entered into derivatives covering 72% and 55% of the acquired companies then expected production volumes for 2007 and 2008, respectively. This price risk management program employed collars and other derivatives intended to help ensure a return on investment while maintaining upside potential that could result from higher commodity prices. In the past year, almost all segments of the global economy have experienced a downturn. This downturn, along with the commodity price volatility, have made the creditworthiness, liquidity and financial position of the Company counterparties increasingly difficult to evaluate. For this reason, the Company has placed an increased emphasis on the monitoring of counterparty risk. Although Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third parties, in certain situations the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases. Natural Gas Natural gas continues to fulfill a significant portion of North America energy needs and the Company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. Natural gas prices have varied over the last year, with the first three quarters of the year averaging higher than corresponding quarters in 2007 and a year-on-year decrease in the last quarter of 2008. Price volatility persists due to an increase in supply stemming principally from unconventional gas coupled with a decrease in domestic industrial demand. Anadarko markets its natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets. Anadarko Energy Services Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is a marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing, risk management and other services tailored to its customers needs. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. The Company owns a significant amount of natural gas firm transportation capacity that is used to help ensure access to downstream markets which increases the ability to produce the Company natural gas. This transportation capacity also provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when pricing differentials between physical locations occur. The Company also stores some of its purchased natural gas in contracted storage facilities with the intent of selling the gas at a higher price in the future. Normally, the Company will have forward contracts in place (physical delivery or financial derivative instruments) to sell the stored gas at a fixed price. The Company also utilizes these storage facilities to minimize operational disruptions to its ongoing operations. Crude Oil, Condensate and NGLs Anadarko crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the United States (U.S.), Algeria, China and other international areas. Most of the Company U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Oil from Algeria is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as jet and diesel fuel. Oil from China is sold by tanker as Cao Fei Dian (CFD Blend) to customers primarily in the Far East markets. CFD Blend is a heavy sour crude oil which is sold into both the prime fuels refining market and the heavy fuel oil blend stock market. The Company also purchases and sells third-party produced crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Company domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of contracted NGLs storage facilities. The Company utilizes this storage to capture market opportunities and to help minimize fractionation and downstream infrastructure disruptions. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2008 were cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and the initial public offering of WES. The Company used cash primarily to fund Anadarko capital spending program, retire debt, pay income taxes, repurchase Anadarko common stock, pay dividends and redeem preferred stock. Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2007 were divestiture transactions, cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the midstream subsidiary note to a related party. The Company used cash primarily to retire debt, fund Anadarko capital spending program and pay income taxes and dividends. Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2006 were the issuance of debt, cash flow from operating activities and divestitures. During 2006, the Company used cash primarily to fund the acquisitions of Kerr-McGee and Western, fund its capital spending program, repurchase Anadarko common stock, pay dividends and retire debt as well as preferred stock. The downturn in the global economy, along with the turmoil in the financial markets and reduced availability to capital, have increased the importance of maintaining ample liquidity. The pace with which the downturn has occurred made the evaluation of the Company lenders creditworthiness, liquidity and financial position increasingly difficult. For this reason, the Company has increased its diligence in monitoring its lenders funding capabilities. The Company has in place a $1.3 billion RCA and as of December 31, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its RCA. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of its short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2006. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property divestitures and additional borrowings, to secure funds when needed. Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows during the period. Forward-looking information related to the Company liquidity and capital resources are discussed in Outlook that follows. Sources of Cash Cash Flow from Operating Activities Anadarko cash flow from continuing operating activities in 2008 was $6.4 billion compared to $2.8 billion in 2007 and $4.7 billion in 2006. The increase in 2008 cash flow was attributed to higher commodity prices and lower estimated income tax payments in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily related to the 2007 divestitures, partially offset by the effect of lower sales volumes primarily associated with the 2007 divestitures, and realized derivative losses in 2008. The decrease in 2007 cash flow from continuing operations compared to 2006 was attributed to the impact of income taxes on divestitures and higher costs and expenses, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes associated with the acquisitions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Company short-term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk. Sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in prior years. Anadarko long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement, the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations and the level of acquisition and divestiture activity. Divestitures In 2008, Anadarko received proceeds of $2.5 billion from divestitures of certain oil and gas properties primarily in Brazil, onshore in the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Proceeds from divestitures in 2008 were used to reduce debt. During 2007, Anadarko received proceeds of $11.1 billion from its divestiture program. Proceeds from the divestitures in 2007 were used to reduce debt and pay income taxes on taxable gains associated with the divestitures. See Acquisitions and Divestitures . 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Master Limited Partnership Initial Public Offering During the second quarter of 2008, WES completed its initial public offering of 20.8 million common units for net proceeds of $321 million. WES is a Delaware limited partnership formed by Anadarko to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets. See Note 3-Minority Interests under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt. Pursuant to the terms of its partnership agreement, WES is required to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.30 per unit to the extent it has sufficient cash available for distribution. During the third quarter of 2008, WES paid a prorated quarterly cash distribution of $0.1582 per unit for the second quarter of 2008, which corresponds to a quarterly distribution of $0.30 per unit on a full quarter basis. In the fourth quarter of 2008, WES paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.30 per unit for the third quarter of 2008. On January 28, 2009, WES declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.30 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2008 to be paid on February 13, 2009. On December 19, 2008, WES acquired additional midstream assets from Anadarko for aggregate consideration of $210 million, consisting of a $175 million note payable to Anadarko and the issuance of 2.6 million common units of WES to Anadarko. In addition, WES issued additional general partner units to its general partner, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko, to allow it to maintain its 2% general partner interest in WES after contribution by Anadarko of its 2% undivided interest in the midstream assets. Anadarko currently holds an aggregate 61.3% limited partner interest in WES. Margin Deposits The Company is required to provide margin deposits whenever its unrealized losses on derivative transactions with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits, and in some cases only until negotiated maximum limits are reached. Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements. Given the Company price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these deposit requirements. The Company manages its exposure to margin requirements through negotiated credit arrangements with counterparties, which may include collateral caps. If credit thresholds are exceeded, the Company utilizes available cash or letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and maintains ample available committed credit facilities to meet its obligations. The Company current derivative positions continue to ratably settle such that the Company working capital along with its RCA could withstand margin calls resulting from a significant increase in commodity prices. The Company had net margin deposits (cash collateral) of $7 million and $51 million outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 Derivative Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Uses of Cash Capital Expenditures The following table shows the Company capital expenditures relating to continuing operations by category. millions 2008 2007 2006 Property acquisitions Exploration unproved $ 405 $ (293 ) $ 13,372 Development proved 26 (591 ) 14,496 Exploration 1,031 834 806 Development 3,530 2,805 3,084 Total oil and gas costs incurred* 4,992 2,755 31,758 Less: Corporate acquisitions and non-cash property exchanges (106 ) 1,001 (27,491 ) Less: Asset retirement costs (263 ) (194 ) (158 ) Less: Geological and geophysical, exploration overhead and delay rentals expenses and other (344 ) (261 ) (254 ) Less: Amortization of acquired drilling rig contract intangibles (5 ) (86 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures 4,274 3,215 3,855 Gathering, processing and marketing and other 607 775 357 Total capital expenditures* $ 4,881 $ 3,990 $ 4,212 * Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and cost incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment on the consolidated statement of cash flows include certain adjustments that give effect for the timing of actual cash payments in order to represent a cash basis. Anadarko capital expenditures increased 22% in 2008 compared to 2007. The Company capital spending decreased 5% in 2007 compared to 2006. The 2008 increase was due to an increase in development drilling expenditures primarily onshore in the U.S. and exploration lease acquisition activity primarily offshore in the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in expenditures related to construction, and gathering and processing facilities. The decrease in 2007 resulted primarily from a decrease in development drilling and construction expenditures and a decrease in exploration lease acquisition activity, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures on gathering and processing facilities. Additionally, all of the periods were impacted by rising service and material costs. The variances in the mix of oil and gas spending reflect the Company available opportunities based on the near-term ranking of projects by net asset value potential. The property acquisitions in 2008 primarily related to exploratory nonproducing leases. Proved property acquisitions and unproved property acquisitions in 2007 include adjustments of $(600) million and $(484) million, respectively, related to finalizing the allocation of fair value to oil and gas properties acquired from Kerr-McGee and Western in 2006. The property acquisitions in 2006 related primarily to Kerr-McGee and Western. Anadarko participated in a total of 2,838 gross wells in 2008 compared to 1,823 gross wells in 2007 and 1,537 gross wells in 2006. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements See Outlook below for information regarding sources of cash used to fund capital expenditures for 2009.

Debt At year-end 2008, Anadarko total debt was $12.3 billion compared to total debt of $14.7 billion at year-end 2007 and $23.0 billion at year-end 2006. As of December 31, 2007, current debt included $1 billion under a variable-rate 354-day facility. This facility was fully repaid and concurrently retired in February 2008. Also in 2008, the Company retired $580 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due September 2009. In 2008 the Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion of debt (including the variable-rate 354-day facility) that was outstanding at December 31, 2007. In March 2008, the Company entered into a $1.3 billion, five-year RCA with a syndicate of United States and foreign lenders. Under the terms of the RCA, the Company can, under certain conditions, request an increase in the borrowing capacity under the RCA up to a total available credit amount of $2.0 billion. The RCA has a maximum 65% debt to total book capitalization covenant (excluding non-cash charges). The RCA terminates in March 2013. The RCA replaced a $750 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in 2009 and was retired. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCA. Anadarko was in compliance with existing covenants and the full amount of the RCA was available for borrowing at December 31, 2008. The Company plans to repay current debt of $1.5 billion outstanding at December 31, 2008 with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and, if necessary, funds available under the $1.3 billion RCA or debt refinancing. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table shows the Company debt-to-capital ratio. December 31, December 31, millions except percentages 2008 2007 Current debt $ 1,472 $ 1,396 Long-term debt 9,128 11,151 Total debt excluding related party debt 10,600 12,547 Midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party 1,739 2,200 Total debt $ 12,339 $ 14,747 Equity $ 18,795 $ 16,364 Debt-to-capital ratio 39.6 % 47.4 % In January 2008, Anadarko entered into forward-looking 18-month interest rate swaps effective March 2008 with an aggregate notional principal amount of $1.0 billion whereby the Company will pay a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 2.74% and receive a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR rate. Anadarko discontinued hedge accounting on January 1, 2007, therefore all gains and losses associated with these swaps will be recorded to interest expense. In anticipation of the refinancing of existing debt obligations, Anadarko entered into swaps to fix interest rates and in doing so mitigated a portion of the risk it had to unfavorable interest rate changes prior to the future issuance of debt. In December 2008, Anadarko entered into three-year forward-looking 10-year swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $400 million, a three-year forward-looking 30-year swap agreement with a notional principal amount of $100 million, and four-year forward-looking 30-year swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $250 million. Under each of these agreements, the Company will pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR rate. In January 2009, Anadarko entered into three-year forward-looking 10-year swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $350 million, three-year forward-looking 30-year swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $1.15 billion, four-year forward-looking 10-year swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $250 million, and four-year forward-looking 30-year swap agreements with a combined notional principal amount of $500 million. Under each of these agreements, the Company will pay a fixed interest rate and receive a floating interest rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR rate. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 8 Derivative Instruments and Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party In December 2007, Anadarko and an entity formed by a group of unrelated third-party investors (the Investor) formed Trinity Associates LLC (Trinity). As discussed in Note 6 Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Trinity was initially capitalized with a $100 million cash contribution from Anadarko in exchange for Class A member and managing member interests in Trinity and a $2.2 billion cash contribution from the Investor in exchange for a Class B member cumulative preferred interest. Trinity invested $100 million in a U.S. Government securities money market fund and loaned $2.2 billion to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anadarko, Midstream Holding. The Company used all of the loan proceeds received by Midstream Holding to repay a portion of the Company acquisition facility indebtedness. The principal balance owed by Midstream Holding to Trinity is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party. Midstream Holdings may repay the loan in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity. Initially, Midstream Holding obligations under the loan agreement were not guaranteed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, but were unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of Midstream Holding subsidiaries. In December 2008, Anadarko provided an unconditional parental guaranty for the payment of principal and interest on the remaining balance of the Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party in exchange for 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the removal of various covenants in the loan agreement. The guaranty is also jointly and severally guaranteed by certain midstream subsidiaries. Midstream Holding was in compliance with all previously existing covenants as of the date the Anadarko parental guaranty was provided. The Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party will have the same priority with respect to the payment of principal and interest as Anadarko other debt. At December 31, 2008, the Midstream Note Payable to a Related Party had an outstanding balance of $1.7 billion. Common Stock Repurchase Program In August 2008, the Company announced a $5 billion share-repurchase program under which shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is authorized to extend through August 2011 and replaces the $1 billion stock buyback program authorized in 2005. The repurchase program does not obligate Anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time. During 2008 and 2006, Anadarko purchased 10.0 million and 2.5 million shares of common stock for $600 million and $118 million, respectively, under these programs through purchases in the open market and under share-repurchase agreements. During 2007, no shares were repurchased under the program in effect at that time. Dividends In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Anadarko paid $170 million, $170 million and $167 million, respectively, in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The covenants in the Company credit agreement provide for a maximum capitalization ratio of 65% debt, exclusive of the effect of any non-cash write-down s. Although the covenants of the agreement do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends, the Company could be limited in the amount of dividends it could pay in order to stay below the maximum capitalization ratio. Based on these covenants as of December 31, 2008, retained earnings of approximately $12.3 billion were not limited as to the payment of dividends. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Anadarko paid $1 million, $3 million and $3 million, respectively, in preferred stock dividends. The preferred stock was redeemed and subsequently retired in the second quarter of 2008. Outlook The Company goals include continuing to find or acquire high-margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices while keeping operating costs at efficient levels. Anadarko strategy involves developing its portfolio of primarily unconventional resources that give the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable and repeatable development opportunities to consistently grow the Company at competitive rates. Exploring in high-potential, proven and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with differential growth. Anadarko exploration success creates value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries. The Company has an approved 2009 capital spending budget, including expensed geology and geophysics costs, of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion. The Company has allocated about 70% of capital spending to development activities, 20% to exploration activities and 10% to gas gathering and processing activities and other items. The Company expects capital spending by area to be approximately 30% for the Rockies, 15% for the Southern region, 20% for the Gulf of Mexico, 25% for International and Alaska and 10% for Midstream and other. Primary emphasis will be on production growth in the Rockies and continued development in the Gulf of Mexico, exploration, appraisal and development wells in Ghana and in Algeria. Production is expected to begin in Ghana in late 2010. The Company capital discipline strategy is to set capital activity at levels that can be funded with operating cash flows and existing cash on hand. Anadarko believes that its expected level of cash flow and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational program for 2009. In addition, to support 2009 cash flows, Anadarko has implemented price risk management on approximately 24% of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes and approximately 28% of its anticipated oil and condensate sales volumes for 2009. If capital expenditures were to exceed operating cash flow, funds would be supplemented as needed by short-term borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place a $1.3 billion RCA and as of December 31, 2008, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its RCA. The Company may choose to 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements refinance certain portions of its short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2006. The Company plans to repay current debt of $1.5 billion outstanding at December 31, 2008 with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and, if necessary, funds available under the $1.3 billion RCA or debt refinancing. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property divestitures and additional borrowings, to secure funds when needed. For additional information on factors that could impact Anadarko future results of operations, cash flows from operating activities or financial position see Critical Accounting Estimates below and Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In 2007, Anadarko contributed certain of its oil and gas properties and gathering and processing assets, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $2.9 billion at the time of contribution, to newly formed unconsolidated entities in exchange for noncontrolling mandatorily redeemable interests in those entities. Subsequent to their formation, the investee entities loaned Anadarko an aggregate of $2.9 billion, which the Company used to repay its acquisition-related debt. Anadarko has a legal right to setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees and the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of such notes does not affect Anadarko reported debt balance, since the notes and the carrying amount of Anadarko investments in the investees are presented on the consolidated balance sheet on a net basis. The related interest expense on these obligations and Anadarko equity in earnings for Anadarko investment in these entities are recorded in other income (expense), net. Note 6 Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K provides additional information with respect to each of these transactions. Completion of these transactions resulted in Anadarko divesting control of its interests in certain non-core exploration and production and midstream assets and operations, while retaining a participating 5% interest in profits, losses and residual value of the investees. With respect to each investee, liquidation of the investee or redemption of Anadarko interest in the investee is expected to result in Anadarko net-settling in cash its obligation under the corresponding note payable with the distributable value of its interest in the investee. The Company does not currently expect such net settlement to have a material effect on its future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Each of Anadarko noncontrolling interests in the investees is optionally redeemable by Anadarko or the controlling investor in or after 2022 and is mandatorily redeemable in 2037. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations and Commitments Following is a summary of the Company obligations as of December 31, 2008: Obligations by Period millions 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More than 5 Years Total Total debt Principal current debt $ 1,472 $ $ $ $ 1,472 Principal long-term debt 1,625 252 9,032 10,909 Midstream subsidiary note payable to a related party 1,739 1,739 Permian LLC and Midstream LLCs debt (1) 2,853 2,853 Interest 659 1,208 967 7,366 10,200 Permian LLC and Midstream LLCs interest (1) 86 173 174 2,468 2,901 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 1,051 1,792 1,014 3,857 Production platforms 64 118 90 314 586 Other 78 123 59 55 315 Asset retirement obligations 16 213 147 992 1,368 Midstream and marketing activities 169 296 234 274 973 Oil and gas activities 470 436 142 95 1,143 Derivative liabilities 24 15 9 3 51 FIN 48 liabilities, interest and penalties (2) 56 56 42 154 Environmental liabilities 43 26 10 40 119 Total ( 3 ) $ 4,188 $ 6,081 $ 4,837 $ 23,534 $ 38,640 (1) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees and the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee.

The interest expense on these obligations and Anadarko equity earnings for Anadarko investment in these entities are recorded in other income (expense), net. See Note 6 Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements discussed above. (2) See Note 16 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3 ) This table does not include the Company pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 22 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Other below. Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include several drilling rig commitments that qualify as operating leases. Over the past three years, Anadarko has entered into several agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over several years. A previous review of the Company worldwide deepwater drilling inventory, along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market experienced in prior years, led Anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy. The Company believes these rig-contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy. The portion of lease payments associated with successful exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties. The Company also has $0.9 billion in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities and aircraft. For additional information see Note 13 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to dispose of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas properties. The asset retirement obligation (ARO) is recorded at its estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation, storage and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas. The above table includes amounts related to these commitments. Oil and Gas Activities As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities, which extend beyond the 2009 budget. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work- related commitments of $1,143 million, comprised of $589 million in the United States, $80 million in Algeria and $474 million in other international locations. The Company also has option and swap contracts in place to manage price risk associated with a portion of its expected future sales of its oil and gas production. Both exchange and over-the-counter traded derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements. Margin deposits are required of the Company whenever its unrealized losses on derivative instruments with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits. Given the Company price risk management position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements. The Company had net margin deposits (cash collateral) of $7 million outstanding at December 31, 2008. Marketing and Trading Contracts The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2008 regarding the Company marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative instruments. See Critical Accounting Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated. millions Marketing and Trading Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 assets (liabilities) $ 11 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during 2008 (12 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during 2008 1 Other changes in fair value 48 Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2008 assets (liabilities) $ 48 Fair Value of Contracts as of December 31, 2008 Assets (Liabilities) millions Maturity less than 1 Year Maturity 1-3 Years Maturity 4-5 Years Maturity in excess of 5 Years Total Marketing and Trading Prices actively quoted $ 48 $ $ $ $ 48 Environmental Anadarko is also subject to various environmental remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2008, the Company balance sheet included a $119 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies that Anadarko has acquired. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information see Legal Proceedings Environmental Matters under Item 3 of this Form 10-K. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other In 2008, the Company made contributions of $63 million to its funded pension plans, $13 million to its unfunded pension plans and $19 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments. Based on the impact of recent market volatility on the plan assets, the Company expects to contribute up to $250 million to its funded pension plans, $23 million to its unfunded pension plans and $22 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans in 2009. Future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions, market performance and individual year funding decisions. The Company is unable to predict what contribution levels will be required beyond 2009 for the funded pension plans. The Company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to be at levels similar to those made in 2008. For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 10 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 8 Derivative Instruments, Note 13 Commitments, and Note 14 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Discontinued Operations In November 2006, Anadarko sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, Anadarko Canada Corporation, for approximately $4 billion before income taxes. Accordingly, the Canadian oil and gas operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows. The following table summarizes selected data pertaining to discontinued operations. millions except per share amounts 2008 2007 2006 Revenues and other $ $ 24 $ 717 Income from discontinued operations $ $ 18 $ 311 Gain on disposition of discontinued operations 98 8 2,494 Income from discontinued operations before income taxes 98 26 2,805 Income tax expense 35 15 530 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ 63 $ 11 $ 2,275 Earnings per common share from discontinued operations diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.02 $ 4.91 Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 17 Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities $ (5 ) $ 134 $ (178 ) Capital expenditures $ $ $ 537 Income from discontinued operations for 2008 and 2007 related primarily to the impact of an adjustment to an indemnity obligation provided by the Company to the purchaser, as well as expenses associated with finalizing exit activities, discussed in Note 14 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2007 decreased compared to 2006 primarily due to the gain on the sale of Canadian operations recognized in 2006, which was partially offset by an increase in Canadian taxes associated with the gain on sale. Under the Company initial 364-day term loan agreement, the Company was required to use net cash proceeds from significant dispositions to repay debt. Because the Canadian assets were subject to this requirement, approximately $58 million of interest expense related to the portion of debt that was repaid with proceeds from the sale of the Canadian operations is included in results of discontinued operations for 2006. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to determination of properties and equipment, proved reserves, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, litigation, environmental liabilities, pension liabilities and costs, income taxes and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the Company Audit Committee. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas activities. Under this method, acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory well costs are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves. Geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed periodically for impairment individually, based on the Company current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. For unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs, costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon expiration. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases are included in exploration expense. Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rocky Mountain region), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area. A majority of the Company unproved leasehold costs are associated with properties acquired in the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions in 2006 and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Company continuing exploitation program. Ultimate recovery of potentially recoverable reserves in areas with established production generally has greater likelihood than in areas with limited or no prior drilling activity. Another portion of the Company unproved leasehold costs are associated with the Land Grant acreage, where the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage. A change in the Company expected future plans for exploration and development could cause a write-down in the Company unproved property. Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a discovery well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements sanctioning, whether development negotiations are under way and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period. At December 31, 2008, suspended exploratory drilling costs were $279 million compared to $308 million at December 31, 2007. Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A expense and impairment expense. In December 2008, the SEC released the final rule for Modernization. The Modernization disclosure requirements will permit reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 12-month period rather than year-end prices and the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves, if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserves volumes. Companies will also be allowed to disclose probable and possible reserves in SEC filed documents. In addition, companies will be required to report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit. The Modernization disclosure requirements become effective for Anadarko Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. The SEC is coordinating with the FASB to obtain the revisions necessary to provide consistency with the Modernization. In the event that consistency is not achieved in time for companies to comply with the Modernization, the SEC will consider delaying the compliance date. A significant change as a result of the Modernization rule relates to the calculation of reserves. Currently, reserves are calculated on a single-day year-end price. Under the Modernization rule, reserves will be calculated on an average price which will reduce the volatility (volatility as demonstrated in 2008) of the reserve calculation. Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for the measurement of derivatives, long-lived assets during certain impairment tests, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, certain exchanges, guarantees, and the initial measurement of an ARO. When the Company is required to measure fair value, and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability, or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability, the Company generally utilizes an income valuation approach. This approach utilizes management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices; estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput; development and operating costs and the timing thereof; economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The Company estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect management expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost. Goodwill At December 31, 2008, the Company had $5.3 billion of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations. This goodwill is not amortized, but is required to be assessed for impairment annually, or more often as facts and circumstances warrant. The first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill. The reporting units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Anadarko has allocated goodwill to three reporting units. These reporting units are oil and gas exploration and production, gathering and processing, and transportation. Goodwill is tested annually on January 1. The Company completed its January 1, 2008 annual goodwill impairment tests with no impairment indicated. As a result of general economic conditions, declines in commodity prices, and declines in its market capitalization compared to the book value of its stockholders equity during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company determined an interim impairment test as of December 31, 2008 was appropriate. The results of this interim goodwill impairment test also resulted in no impairment indicated. Anadarko considered its conclusions in light of its year-end market capitalization being approximately 6% below the book value of its stockholders equity, and concluded the assessment that no impairment was appropriate when considering that the market value for one share of Anadarko common stock does not consider any premium that might be paid by a buyer who would obtain control of Anadarko entire oil and gas, gathering and processing, or transportation reporting units. Although Anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future, impairment charges may occur if the Company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events (for example, lower sustained oil and gas prices) reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit and market multiples of EBITDAX for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit, the Company assumed production profiles utilized in its year-end estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices considering the forward price curve for oil and gas, adjusted for location and quality differentials that the Company currently receives, as well as capital and operating costs consistent with year-end pricing, adjusted for management view that such costs should decline in the near term to realign with lower commodity prices, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize to consider the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. For the Company midstream reporting units, the Company estimated fair value based on an estimated multiple of projected 2009 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The Company 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements considered the relatively few transactions in the market, as well as trading multiples for peers to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for its gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. A lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment. Examples of factors that could cause a lower fair value estimate could be sustained declines in prices, increases in costs, and changes in discount rate assumptions due to market conditions. Impairment of Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may be greater than its future net cash flows. Impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over the asset estimated fair value. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of the impairment review. Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments, other than those that meet specific exclusions, are recorded at fair value. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or utilizing industry standard valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data. Option fair values are measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options if available. Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded within Anadarko current earnings. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, including both qualified and supplemental plans, and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the Company defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the Company decisions for amounts contributed into the plans. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long-term rates of return on plan assets; rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. Anadarko develops demographics and utilizes the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. Discount rate The discount rate assumption used by the Company is meant to reflect the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. The Company currently uses a yield curve analysis, for a majority of the plans, to support the discount rate assumption. This analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical Aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high-quality, non-callable, marketable bonds, then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow. The present values of the cash flows are then accumulated, and a weighted-average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows. The consolidated discount rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted-average discount rates determined for each of the Company significant pension and postretirement plans. The weighted-average discount rate assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2008 was 6.0% for pension plans and other postretirement plans. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2008 pension investment balances by category and projected target asset allocations for 2009. The expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital market projections, with consideration of actual five-year performance statistics for investments in place. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2008 was 7.75%. Rate of compensation increases The Company determines this assumption based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions and general inflation. The weighted-average rate of increase in long-term compensation levels assumption used by the Company as of December 31, 2008 was 5.0%. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. A 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2009, decreasing gradually to 5.0% in 2017 and later years. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation or administration, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, outside legal counsel or consultants are utilized. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by Company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although Company management believes its tax accruals are adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Recent Accounting Developments In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and are therefore required to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share (EPS) under the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating EPS. FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008; early adoption is not permitted. The Company adopted FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 effective January 1, 2009. FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 will not affect Anadarko presentation of EPS. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 does not change the accounting policy for derivatives, but requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items (if any) are accounted for, and how they affect the Company financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for Anadarko for annual and interim periods beginning with the first quarter of 2009. Anadarko did not elect early adoption. SFAS No. 161 is a disclosure requirement that does not affect Anadarko consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51 . SFAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as a component of consolidated equity. This is a change from the current practice to present noncontrolling interests in liabilities or between liabilities and stockholders equity. Similarly, SFAS No. 160 requires consolidated net income and comprehensive income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests. Anadarko will be required to adopt accounting provisions of SFAS No. 160 prospectively with respect to transactions involving noncontrolling financial interests that occur on or after January 1, 2009. Presentation and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 160 will also be applied effective January 1, 2009, but with respect to all periods presented. After adopting SFAS No. 160 in 2009, the Company will apply provisions of this standard to noncontrolling interests created or acquired in future periods. Upon adoption, the Company will reclassify its minority interests to stockholders equity. For additional information on recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
