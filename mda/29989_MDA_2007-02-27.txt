Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary We are a strategic holding company. We provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world. On a global, pan-regional and local basis, our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines: traditional media advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications. Our business model was built and evolves around our clients. While our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. The fundamental premise of our business is that our clients specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client specific marketing requirements. We continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client-centric approach, as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong, entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base. In prior years, our industry was affected by several factors, including geopolitical unrest and lagging economic conditions that contributed to a difficult business environment and industry-wide margin contraction. During this period, we continued to invest in our businesses and our personnel and took action to reduce costs at some of our agencies to address the changing economic circumstances. Recently, improving economic conditions, coupled with the business trends described below, have had a positive impact on our business and our industry. Several long-term trends continue to positively affect our business, including our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan-regional and global markets and from traditional marketing channels to non-traditional channels and new media outlets. Additionally, in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their marketing dollars, clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of their traditional advertising and marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers. The diversity and balance of our portfolio of companies and service offerings have enabled us to continue to grow our revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share. In the United States, revenue grew at a rate of 7.8% in 2006, which is below our prior year rate of 10.0%. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth for our international business increased by 7.9% in 2006, which is an increase from our prior year rate of 3.5%. Overall, in the past year, we believe that our businesses have performed well across our operating regions. In addition, we expect to continue to increase our investment in an already improving Asian market. We also plan to focus on businesses that will complement and enhance our existing strategic platforms and service capabilities to better serve our clients in various regions. In 2006, we experienced an increase in our operating margins over the previous year. This improvement is the result of our new business initiatives and wins, as well as our cost management actions. Our operating margin for 2006 was 13.0% compared to 12.8% in 2005. We expect that we will be able to maintain operating margins at 2006 levels and we will continue to pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins and maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses. Given our size and breadth, we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators. The key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses. We analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth, including growth by major geographic location, growth by major marketing discipline, growth from currency fluctuations, growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients. In recent years, our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations. In 2006, our overall revenue growth was 8.5%, of which 0.7% was related to changes in foreign exchange rates and 0.2% was related to the acquisition of entities, net of entities disposed. The remainder, 7.6%, was organic growth. 9 In 2006, traditional media advertising represented about 43% of the total revenue and grew by 6.0% over the prior year. CRM represented about 36% of the total revenue and grew by 13.0% over the previous year. Public relations represented about 10% of the total revenue and grew by 10.0% over the previous year and specialty communications represented about 11% of total revenue and grew by 3.7% over the previous year. We measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories, salary and service costs, and office and general expenses. Salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs and office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs, technology related costs and depreciation and amortization. Each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines. At the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client brand and its selling proposition, and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client target audience. The facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines, and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software. Because we are a service business, we monitor these costs on a percentage of revenue basis. Salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue, whereas office and general expenses, which are not directly related to servicing clients, tend to decrease as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases because a significant portion of these expenses are relatively fixed in nature. During 2006, salary and service costs increased to 71.1% of revenue from 70.7% of revenue in 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue levels and the necessary increases in direct salaries, salary-related costs and freelance labor costs necessary to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives, as well as increases in incentive-based compensation costs. Office and general expenses declined to 15.9% of revenue from 16.5% in 2005 as a result of our continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a location-by-location basis. Our net income for 2006 increased by 9.3% to $864.0 million from $790.7 million in 2005 and our diluted EPS increased by 14.4% to $4.99 from $4.36 in the prior year for the reasons described above, as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year. This reduction was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan. Critical Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies We have prepared the following summary of our accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related MD&A. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements, including our discussion in Note 1 setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail, for a more complete understanding of accounting policies discussed below. Estimates: Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and require us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets, accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results can differ from those estimates, and it is possible that the differences could be material. A fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under SFAS 142 and when evaluating cost-based investments, which consist of ownership interests in non-public companies, to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. We consider and use several comparable market participant measurements to determine fair value, including consideration of similar and recent transactions and when available and as appropriate, we use comparative market multiples. We also use a discounted cash flow 10 methodology. Numerous estimates and assumptions have to be made when completing a discounted cash flow valuation, including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates, appropriate discount rates and capital structure. Additionally, estimates must be made regarding revenue growth, operating margins, tax rates, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. Judgment is required when determining fair value, including when we evaluate the applicability of similar and recent transactions, and when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material. Additional information about impairment testing under SFAS 142 and valuation of cost-based investments appears in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, as well as Note 6 with respect to cost-based investments. A fair value approach is used in determining the award value of stock-based employee compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R. We utilize the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards. This valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life, rate of risk free interest, volatility and dividend yield. If different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value, our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. Additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions and Goodwill: We have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions. In making acquisitions, the price we pay is determined by various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, competitive position, geographic coverage and service offerings, as well as our experience and judgment. The amount we paid for acquisitions, including cash, stock and assumption of net liabilities, totaled $311.4 million in 2006 and $327.2 million in 2005. Approximately 51% and 63%, respectively, of these amounts related to contingent purchase price obligations paid during the respective year related to acquisitions previously completed. A summary of our contingent purchase price obligations, sometimes referred to as earn-outs, and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A. The amount of contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are based on future performance. Contingent purchase price obligations are accrued, in accordance with GAAP, when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain. Our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and/or their service capabilities to better serve our clients. Additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know-how of the acquisition targets. Accordingly, like most service businesses, a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the know-how of the people, which is treated as part of goodwill and, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations ( SFAS 141 ), is not valued separately. For each of our acquisitions, we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such assets identified. The majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships. When making the necessary valuation assumptions of these identified intangible assets, we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements. The expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually. In accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS 142, we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments, which are our five agency networks. The regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region. They report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client-centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions. We then concluded, that for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in paragraph 17 of SFAS No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ( SFAS 131 ), and the guidance set forth in EITF D-101: 11 Clarification of Reporting Unit Guidance in Paragraph 30 of FASB Statement No. 142. Consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy, the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients. In addition, the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics, as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services, the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy, and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy. Based on the results of our impairment testing, we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their book value and therefore, our goodwill was not impaired. Additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: Substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour, or equivalent basis, and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement, upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured. We record revenue net of taxes, including sales tax, use tax, value added tax and/or excise tax. Certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements. These principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines traditional media advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications. More specifically, in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), as updated by SAB 104 Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ), our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue: persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist; the sales price must be fixed or determinable; delivery, performance and acceptance in accordance with the client arrangement; and collection is reasonably assured. Because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways, all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines. In the majority of our businesses, we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained, when the fee or commission is earned. In certain cases, we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and third-party production costs and are responsible for their payment, recharging our clients for all costs incurred. Although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities, the arrangements with our clients are such that, in effect, we act as an agent on their behalf. In these cases, costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue. A small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals. We recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved, or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients. Additional information about our revenue recognition appears in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Employee Stock-Based Compensation: In accordance with SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, we elected, effective January 1, 2004, to account for stock-based employee compensation using the fair value method. In determining the fair value of certain stock-based compensation awards, we use certain estimates and assumptions such as expected life, rate of risk free interest, volatility and dividend yield. If different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value at the date of grant, our actual results could be different. As a result of our adoption of SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148, the fair value of stock-based employee compensation was recorded as an expense in the current and prior years. Accordingly, our results for years prior to 2004 have been restated as if we had used the fair value method to account for stock-based employee compensation. Pre-tax stock-based employee compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $71.1 million, $87.0 million and $117.2 million, respectively. Information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 12 On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS 123R ) that requires, among other things, that we record stock-based compensation expense net of an estimate for awards that are expected to be forfeited. For all unvested awards outstanding at January 1, 2006, we recorded an adjustment to reflect the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle. The adjustment in the first quarter of 2006 resulted in an increase in our operating profit and net income of $3.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Because this adjustment did not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition, we did not present this adjustment on an after-tax basis as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our income statement. SFAS 123R also requires that new stock-based compensation awards issued to individuals that are, or will become, retirement-eligible during the vesting period of the award to be expensed over the lesser of the period from the date of grant through the retirement-eligible date or the vesting date. This differs from our previous policy for awards that were issued prior to adoption of SFAS 123R with retirement eligibility provisions. For those awards, we recognized compensation expense over the vesting period and we accelerated compensation expense upon the triggering of a retirement event. For the year ended December 31, 2006, $13.5 million of pre-tax amortization of stock-based employee compensation expense was recorded related to unvested awards at December 31, 2005 that were issued prior to adoption of SFAS 123R to individuals that were retirement eligible at December 31, 2005 and the awards included retirement eligibility provisions. Had SFAS 123R been in effect when these awards were issued, stock-based compensation expense in 2006 would have been reduced by $13.5 million. SFAS 123R provides transition alternatives with respect to calculating the pool of windfall tax benefits within our additional paid-in capital (the APIC Pool ) that are available on the adoption date to offset potential future shortfalls. The APIC Pool results from the amount by which our prior year tax deductions for stock-based compensation exceed the cumulative book stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. We utilized the short-cut method as prescribed by FASB Statement of Position 123R-3 to calculate the APIC Pool. Finally, SFAS 123R requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based employee compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, as previously required. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by $26.6 million, which was recorded as an increase in cash provided by financing activities. Additional information regarding the changes required by SFAS 123R and its impact on our financial statements can be found in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Pronouncements In addition to those discussed previously, additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements can also be found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements also includes a summary of our significant accounting policies. 13 Financial Results from Operations 2006 Compared with 2005 Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 Revenue $ 11,376.9 $ 10,481.1 Operating Expenses: Salary and service costs 8,087.8 7,412.9 Office and general expenses 1,805.6 1,728.4 9,893.4 9,141.3 Operating Profit 1,483.5 1,339.8 Net Interest Expense: Interest expense 124.9 78.0 Interest income (33.3 ) (18.8 ) 91.6 59.2 Income Before Income Taxes 1,391.9 1,280.6 Income Taxes 466.9 435.3 Income After Income Taxes 925.0 845.3 Equity in Earnings of Affiliates 29.6 27.6 Minority Interests (90.6 ) (82.2 ) Net Income $ 864.0 $ 790.7 Net Income Per Common Share: Basic $ 5.04 $ 4.38 Diluted 4.99 4.36 Dividends Declared Per Common Share $1.000 $0.925 The following year-over-year analysis gives further details and insight into the changes in our financial performance. Revenue: When comparing performance between years, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes, acquisitions/dispositions and organic growth have on reported revenue. We derive significant revenue from international operations and changes in foreign currency rates between the years impact our reported results. Our reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth. Accordingly, we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue period-to-period. Our 2006 consolidated worldwide revenue increased 8.5% to $11,376.9 million from $10,481.1 million in 2005. The effect of foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by $72.3 million. Acquisitions, net of disposals, increased 2006 worldwide revenue by $25.9 million and organic growth increased worldwide revenue by $797.6 million. The components of total 2006 revenue growth in the U.S. ( domestic ) and the remainder of the world ( international ) are summarized below (dollars in millions): Total Domestic International $ % $ % $ % December 31, 2005 $10,481.1 $5,743.9 $ 4,737.2 Components of revenue changes: Foreign exchange impact 72.3 0.7 % 72.3 1.5 % Acquisitions 25.9 0.2 % 34.6 0.6 % (8.7 ) (0.2 )% Organic 797.6 7.6 % 415.5 7.2 % 382.1 8.1 % December 31, 2006 $11,376.9 8.5 % $6,194.0 7.8 % $ 5,182.9 9.4 % The components and percentages are calculated as follows: The foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue (in this case $11,304.6 million for the Total column in the table). 14 The foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency (in this case $11,376.9 million less $11,304.6 million for the Total column in the table). The acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses. Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period. The organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth. The percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component (in this case $10,481.1 million for the Total column in the table). The components of revenue for 2006 and revenue growth compared to 2005 in our primary geographic markets are summarized below (dollars in millions): Revenue % Growth United States $ 6,194.0 7.8 % Euro Markets 2,313.5 7.3 % United Kingdom 1,229.7 11.6 % Other 1,639.7 10.9 % Total $11,376.9 8.5 % As indicated, foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by $72.3 million for 2006. The most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Euro and Brazilian Real against the U.S. Dollar, which was offset primarily by the decline of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. Based on exchange rates at January 31, 2007, we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our full-year 2007 consolidated revenue by between 1.0% and 1.5%. Additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Due to a variety of factors, in the normal course, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year. The net result in 2006, and historically each year for us as a whole, was an overall gain in new business. Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients. Revenue from our single largest client represented 3.6% of our worldwide revenue in 2006 and 4.0% in 2005. No other client represented more than 2.9% in 2006 or 2005. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 18.3% and 46.2% of our 2006 worldwide revenue, respectively, and 18.5% and 44.6% of our 2005 worldwide revenue, respectively. Driven by our clients continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities, we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising, marketing and corporate communications services through various client-centric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives. These services include advertising, brand consultancy, crisis communications, custom publishing, database management, digital and interactive marketing, direct marketing, directory advertising, entertainment marketing, environmental design, experiential marketing, field marketing, financial / corporate business-to-business advertising, graphic arts, healthcare communications, instore design, investor relations, marketing research, media planning and buying, mobile marketing services, multi-cultural marketing, non-profit marketing, organizational communications, package design, product placement, promotional marketing, public affairs, public relations, recruitment communications, reputation consulting, retail marketing, search engine marketing and sports and event marketing. In an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients, we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below: traditional media advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications. 15 Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2006 vs 2005 Revenue % of Revenue Revenue % of Revenue $ Growth % Growth Traditional media advertising $ 4,866.4 42.8 % $ 4,589.0 43.8 % $277.4 6.0 % CRM 4,081.1 35.9 % 3,613.0 34.5 % 468.1 13.0 % Public relations 1,150.1 10.1 % 1,045.7 10.0 % 104.4 10.0 % Specialty communications 1,279.3 11.2 % 1,233.4 11.7 % 45.9 3.7 % $11,376.9 $10,481.1 $895.8 8.5 % Operating Expenses: Our 2006 worldwide operating expenses increased $752.1 million, or 8.2%, to $9,893.4 million from $9,141.3 million in 2005, as shown below. Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2006 vs 2005 $ % of Revenue % of Total Operating Expenses $ % of Revenue % of Total Operating Expenses $ Growth % Growth Revenue $11,376.9 $10,481.1 $895.8 8.5 % Operating Expenses: Salary and service costs 8,087.8 71.1 % 81.7 % 7,412.9 70.7 % 81.1 % 674.9 9.1 % Office and general expenses 1,805.6 15.9 % 18.3 % 1,728.4 16.5 % 18.9 % 77.2 4.5 % Total Operating Expenses 9,893.4 87.0 % 9,141.3 87.2 % 752.1 8.2 % Operating Profit $ 1,483.5 13.0 % $ 1,339.8 12.8 % $143.7 10.7 % Because we provide professional services, salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses. During 2006, we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel. As a percentage of total operating expenses, salary and service costs were 81.7% in 2006 and 81.1% in 2005. These costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs. Most, or $674.9 million and 89.7%, of the $752.1 million increase in total operating expenses in 2006 resulted from increases in salary and service costs. This increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in 2006 and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives, including direct salaries, salary related costs and direct service costs, including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs, such as travel, as well as increases in incentive-based compensation costs. This increase was partially offset by reductions in severance and employee stock-based compensation expense. As a result, salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased year-to-year from 70.7% in 2005 to 71.1% in 2006. Office and general expenses represented 18.3% and 18.9% of our operating expenses in 2006 and 2005, respectively. These costs are comprised of office and equipment rents, technology costs and depreciation, amortization of identifiable intangible assets, professional fees and other overhead expenses. As a percentage of revenue, office and general expenses decreased in 2006 from 16.5% to 15.9% as a result of continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a location-by-location basis. These costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs. Although they tend to increase as our revenues increase, the rate of increase could be more, or less than the rate of increase in our revenues. We expect our efforts to control operating expenses will continue as we continuously look for ways to increase the variability of our cost structure. We expect that we will be able to maintain operating margins at 2006 levels and we will continue to pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins and maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses. Included in office and general expense for 2006 operating margin is a pre-tax net loss of $0.5 million arising from the sale in the third quarter of a U.S.-based healthcare business and several small businesses. The sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the non-deductibility of goodwill. This increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a one-time reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws. The aggregate impact 16 of these events was a decrease in profit before tax of $0.5 million, a decrease in tax expense of $1.8 million and an increase in net income of $1.3 million. Excluding the net loss of $0.5 million, our 2006 operating margin was unchanged. Included in office and general expense for 2005 is a pre-tax net gain of $6.9 million arising from the sale in the first quarter of a majority-owned business located in Australia and New Zealand and the disposal of a non-strategic business located in the United States. Due to the unusually high book tax rate caused by the non-deductibility of goodwill, the book tax cost of the transactions was $6.1 million. After deducting minority interest expense, the impact of these transactions increased net income in 2005 by $0.4 million. Excluding the net gain of $6.9 million from investment activity, office and general expenses were 16.6% of revenue in 2005. Net Interest Expense: Our net interest expense increased in 2006 to $91.6 million, as compared to $59.2 million in 2005. Our gross interest expense increased by $46.9 million to $124.9 million. This increase was primarily impacted by $45.5 million of additional interest costs related to the issuance of our 5.90% Senior Notes due April 15, 2016 ( Senior Notes ) and $23.9 million of additional interest costs associated with the amortization, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) No. 96-19, Debtor Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments ( EITF 96-19 ), of supplemental interest payments made with respect to our Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2031 ( 2031 Notes ). These increases were partially offset by interest expense savings relative to the redemption at maturity in June 2005 of our Euro-denominated ( ) 152.4 million 5.20% Notes, as well as interest expense savings under our commercial paper program compared to the prior year. The increase in interest income is the result of increased levels of cash and short-term investments on hand during the year as well as increases in short-term interest rates. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters. Income Taxes: Our 2006 consolidated effective income tax rate was 33.5%, which is lower than our 2005 rate of 34.0%. The 33.5% tax rate for 2006 was impacted by the following activity. During the third quarter of 2006, we disposed of a U.S.-based healthcare business and several small businesses as described above. The sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the allocation of non-deductible goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142. This increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a one-time reduction of income tax expense resulting from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in foreign tax laws. Excluding this activity, our tax rate for 2006 would have been 33.7%. The 34.0% tax rate for 2005 was also high, as it was impacted by the sale in the first quarter of 2005 of a majority-owned business in Australia and New Zealand that resulted in a gain and an unusually high book tax rate on that gain. Excluding the effect of the gain and the related tax impact, our 2005 tax rate would also have been 33.7%. Earnings Per Share (EPS): For the foregoing reasons, our net income in 2006 increased $73.3 million, or 9.3%, to $864.0 million from $790.7 million in 2005. Diluted earnings per share increased 14.4% to $4.99 in 2006, as compared to $4.36 in the prior year for the reasons described above, as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year. This reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan. A substantial portion of our treasury share repurchases were made in connection with an accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) program described in our Liquidity and Capital Resource discussion and in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. 17 Financial Results from Operations 2005 Compared with 2004 Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Revenue $ 10,481.1 $ 9,747.2 Operating Expenses: Salary and service costs 7,412.9 6,846.8 Office and general expenses 1,728.4 1,685.0 9,141.3 8,531.8 Operating Profit 1,339.8 1,215.4 Net Interest Expense: Interest expense 78.0 51.1 Interest income (18.8 ) (14.5 ) 59.2 36.6 Income Before Income Taxes 1,280.6 1,178.8 Income Taxes 435.3 396.3 Income After Income Taxes 845.3 782.5 Equity in Earnings of Affiliates 27.6 17.1 Minority Interests (82.2 ) (76.1 ) Net Income $ 790.7 $ 723.5 Net Income Per Common Share: Basic $ 4.38 $ 3.90 Diluted 4.36 3.88 Dividends Declared Per Common Share $ 0.925 $ 0.900 The following year-over-year analysis gives further details and insight into the changes in our financial performance. Revenue: When comparing performance between years, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes, acquisitions/dispositions and organic growth have on reported revenues. We derive significant revenue from international operations and changes in foreign currency rates between the years impact our reported results. Reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth. Accordingly, we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue period-to-period. Our 2005 consolidated worldwide revenue increased 7.5% to $10,481.1 million from $9,747.2 million in 2004. Foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by $53.3 million. The effect of acquisitions, net of disposals, decreased 2005 worldwide revenue by $28.8 million. Organic growth increased worldwide revenue by $709.4 million. The components of total 2005 revenue growth in the U.S. ( domestic ) and the remainder of the world ( international ) are summarized below (dollars in millions): Total Domestic International $ % $ % $ % December 31, 2004 $ 9,747.2 $5,223.4 $ 4,523.8 Components of revenue changes: Foreign exchange impact 53.3 0.5 % 53.3 1.2 % Acquisitions (28.8 ) (0.3 )% 52.6 1.0 % (81.4 ) (1.8 )% Organic 709.4 7.3 % 467.9 9.0 % 241.5 5.3 % December 31, 2005 $ 10,481.1 7.5 % $5,743.9 10.0 % $ 4,737.2 4.7 % The negative acquisition growth in international revenue is attributable to the disposition of a CRM agency located in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2005. 18 The components and percentages are calculated as follows: The foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue (in this case $10,427.8 million for the Total column in the table). The foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency (in this case $10,481.1 million less $10,427.8 million for the Total column in the table). The acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses. Netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period. The organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth. The percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component (in this case $9,747.2 million for the Total column in the table). The components of revenue for 2005 and revenue growth compared to 2004 in our primary geographic markets are summarized below (dollars in millions): Revenue % Growth United States $ 5,743.9 10.0 % Euro Markets 2,156.5 4.8 % United Kingdom 1,102.4 1.6 % Other 1,478.3 7.1 % Total $10,481.1 7.5 % As indicated, foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by $53.3 million for 2005. The most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and Brazilian Real against the U.S. Dollar, which was offset primarily by the decline of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Due to a variety of factors, in the normal course, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year. The net result in 2005, and historically each year for us as a whole, was an overall gain in new business. Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients. Revenue from our single largest client represented 4.0% of our worldwide revenue in 2005 and 4.3% in 2004. No other client represented more than 2.9% in 2005 or 2004. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented 18.5% and 44.6% of our 2005 worldwide revenue, respectively, and 18.3% and 45.1% of our 2004 worldwide revenue, respectively. In an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients, we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below: traditional media advertising, CRM, public relations and specialty communications. Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2005 vs 2004 Revenue % of Revenue Revenue % of Revenue $ Growth % Growth Traditional media advertising $ 4,589.0 43.8 % $4,207.5 43.2 % $381.5 9.1 % CRM 3,613.0 34.5 % 3,382.6 34.7 % 230.4 6.8 % Public relations 1,045.7 10.0 % 1,024.0 10.5 % 21.7 2.1 % Specialty communications 1,233.4 11.7 % 1,133.1 11.6 % 100.3 8.9 % $10,481.1 $9,747.2 $733.9 7.5 % 19 Operating Expenses: Our 2005 worldwide operating expenses increased $609.5 million, or 7.1%, to $9,141.3 million from $8,531.8 million in 2004, as shown below. Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2005 vs 2004 $ % of Revenue % of Total Operating Expenses $ % of Revenue % of Total Operating Expenses $ Growth % Growth Revenue $10,481.1 $9,747.2 $733.9 7.5 % Operating Expenses: Salary and service costs 7,412.9 70.7 % 81.1 % 6,846.8 70.2 % 80.3 % 566.1 8.3 % Office and general expenses 1,728.4 16.5 % 18.9 % 1,685.0 17.3 % 19.7 % 43.4 2.6 % Total Operating Expenses 9,141.3 87.2 % 8,531.8 87.5 % 609.5 7.1 % Operating Profit $ 1,339.8 12.8 % $1,215.4 12.5 % $124.4 10.2 % Because we provide professional services, salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses. During 2005, we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel. As a percentage of total operating expenses, salary and service costs were 81.1% in 2005 and 80.3% in 2004. These costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs. Most, or $566.1 million and 92.9%, of the $609.5 million increase in total operating expenses in 2005 resulted from increases in salary and service costs. This increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in 2005 and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives, including direct salaries, salary related costs and direct service costs, including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs, such as travel. In addition, cash-based incentive compensation, such as bonus and profit sharing, increased in 2005 when compared to 2004. However, this increase was largely offset by a reduction in the amortization of employee stock-based compensation. As a result, salary and service costs as a percentage of revenues increased year-to-year from 70.2% in 2004 to 70.7% in 2005. Office and general expenses represented 18.9% and 19.7% of our operating expenses in 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs are comprised of office and equipment rent, technology costs and depreciation, amortization of identifiable intangible assets, professional fees and other overhead expenses. As a percentage of revenue, office and general expenses decreased in 2005 from 17.3% to 16.5% as a result of continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a location-by-location basis. These costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs. Although they tend to increase as our revenues increase, the rate of increase could be more, or less than the rate of increase in our revenues. Included in office and general expense for 2005 is a pre-tax net gain of $6.9 million arising from the sale in the first quarter of a majority-owned business located in Australia and New Zealand and the disposal of a non-strategic business located in the United States. Due to the unusually high book tax rate caused by the non-deductibility of goodwill, the book tax cost of the transactions was $6.1 million. After deducting minority interest expense, the impact of these transactions increased net income in 2005 by $0.4 million. Included in office and general expense for 2004 was a net gain of $13.1 million related to investment activity during the first quarter of 2004. In March 2004, in connection with Seneca Investments LLC recapitalization, we agreed to exchange our remaining preferred stock in Seneca for a $24.0 million senior secured note and 40% of Seneca outstanding common stock. The note, due in March 2007, bears interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum. The recapitalization transaction was required to be recorded at fair value and, accordingly, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $24.0 million. This gain was partially offset by losses of $10.9 million on other cost-based investments unrelated to our investment in Seneca. We received distributions from Seneca during 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 that reduced the outstanding balance of the note to zero. Excluding these net gains of $6.9 million and $13.1 million from investment activity, office and general expenses were 16.6% of revenue in 2005, compared to 17.4% of revenue in 2004 and operating margin increased to 12.7% of revenue in 2005 from 12.3% of revenue in 2004. Net Interest Expense: Our net interest expense increased in 2005 to $59.2 million, as compared to $36.6 million in 2004. Our gross interest expense increased by $26.9 million to $78.0 million. This increase resulted from $24.4 million of additional interest costs associated with the amortization, in accordance with EITF 96-19, 20 of supplemental interest payments we made during 2005 and the fourth quarter of 2004 to holders of certain of our convertible notes. In August 2005, we paid $33.5 million to holders of our 2032 Notes to not exercise certain put rights and, in November 2004, we paid $14.8 million and $1.5 million in the aggregate, respectively, to consenting holders of our 2031 Notes and Zero Coupon Zero Yield Convertible Notes due 2033 ( 2033 Notes ) as incentives to consent to certain amendments to our indentures and not exercise certain put rights. Substantially all of the year-over-year increase in these supplemental interest payments was due to market increases in short-term interest rates. These increases were partially offset by interest expense savings relative to the redemption at maturity in June 2005 of our 152.4 million 5.20% Notes. Income Taxes: Our 2005 consolidated effective income tax rate was 34.0%. Excluding the impact relating to an unusually high book tax rate on the 2005 net gain on the sale of certain foreign businesses, as described above in our discussion on operating expenses, our tax rate was 33.7% which is comparable to our 2004 year rate of 33.6%. The FASB issued two staff positions on accounting for income taxes to address recent changes enacted by the United States Congress, Staff Position FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax Deduction Provided to U.S. Based Manufacturers by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act ) ( FSP No. 109-1 ), and Staff Position FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provisions within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( FSP No. 109-2). We believe that FSP 109-1 does not apply to our business. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $47.9 million of foreign earnings utilizing the 85% dividend received deduction provided by the Jobs Act and in accordance with FSP 109-2, we recorded a $2.7 million domestic tax liability, which is included in our full year effective tax rate of 34.0%. Earnings Per Share (EPS): For the foregoing reasons, our net income in 2005 increased $67.2 million by 9.3%, to $790.7 million from $723.5 million in 2004. Diluted earnings per share increased 12.4% to $4.36 in 2005, as compared to $3.88 in the prior year for the reasons described above, as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year. This reduction was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements, Including Contractual Obligations Historically, substantially all of our non-discretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand. Our principal non-discretionary funding requirement is our working capital. In addition, as discussed below, we have contractual obligations related to our debt, senior notes and convertible notes, our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations, as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years. Our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders, repurchases of our common stock, payments for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand and, in 2006, from our $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.90% Senior Notes due April 15, 2016 ( Senior Notes ) offering. The gross proceeds from the Senior Notes sold in March 2006 were $995.1 million. In addition, in any given year, depending on the level of discretionary activity, we may use other sources of available funding, such as the liquidation of short-term investments or the issuance of commercial paper to finance these activities. We have a seasonal working capital cycle. Working capital requirements are lowest at year-end. The fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than $1.5 billion. This cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients, including when we place media and incur production costs. We generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations. During the year, we manage liquidity 21 through our credit facilities as discussed below under Cash Management. At December 31, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $903.7 million from December 31, 2005. The components of the increase in 2006 are summarized below (dollars in millions): SOURCES Cash Flow from Operations $ 1,741.2 Gross proceeds from issuance of Senior Notes 995.1 Eliminate changes in net working capital (564.5 ) Subtotal, Principal Cash Sources 2,171.8 USES Capital expenditures $ (177.6 ) Dividends paid (175.8 ) Acquisition payments, net of cash acquired and proceeds from sale of $31.4 million (204.9 ) Purchase of treasury shares (net of proceeds from stock option exercises and stock sold in our employee stock purchase plan of $297.9 million) (1,046.7 ) Subtotal, Principal Discretionary Cash Uses (1,605.0 ) Principal Cash Sources in Excess of Discretionary Cash Uses 566.8 Repayment of principal of long-term debt (300.4 ) Eliminate changes in net working capital 564.5 Exchange rate changes (65.2 ) Other, principally net proceeds from sales of short-term investments 138.0 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 903.7 The Principal Cash Sources and Principal Discretionary Cash Uses numbers presented above are non-GAAP financial measures. These amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities, including commercial paper issuances and redemptions, used to fund these working capital changes. This presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow. Additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: We enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business. The following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations as of December 31, 2006 and should be read together with Note 3 (Bank loans and lines of credit), Note 4 (Long-term debt and convertible notes), Note 10 (Commitments and contingent liabilities), Note 11 (Fair value of financial instruments) and Note 12 (Financial instruments and market risk) to our consolidated financial statements. Due in Less than 1 Year Due in 1 to 5 Years Due after 5 Years Total Contractual Obligations at December 31, 2006 (Dollars in millions) Long-term debt $ 1.1 $ 17.7 $ 995.5 $1,014.3 Convertible notes 2,041.5 2,041.5 Lease obligations 412.9 1,051.7 708.4 2,173.0 Other 12.9 7.4 20.3 Total $426.9 $1,076.8 $3,745.4 $5,249.1 As more fully described below under the heading Debt Instruments, Guarantees and Related Covenants, the holders of the convertible notes included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future. If these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date, as set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, $1,574.0 million of the $2,041.5 million of the convertible notes could be due in less than one year. 22 Due in Less than 1 Year Due in 1 to 5 Years Due after 5 Years Total Other Commercial Commitments at December 31, 2006 (Dollars in millions) Lines of credit $ $ $ $ Guarantees and letters of credit 0.4 0.9 0.1 1.4 Total $ 0.4 $ 0.9 $ 0.1 $ 1.4 In the normal course of business, our agencies enter into various contractual media commitments on behalf of our clients at levels substantially exceeding our revenue. These commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the providers. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses for media commitments entered into on behalf of our clients and we believe that we do not have substantial exposure to potential losses of this nature in the future as we monitor closely the credit worthiness of our clients. In the event that we are committed to the media services and our client has not paid us, we believe that the risk of material loss is minimal because in the normal course of business we have reasonable options available to us to substantially mitigate potential losses. Contingent Acquisition Obligations: Certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations, often referred to as earn-outs. We utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the post-acquisition transition period. These payments are not contingent upon future employment. The amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for prior acquisitions, assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels, is approximately $448 million as of December 31, 2006. The ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not recorded a liability for these items on our balance sheet since the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable. Actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates. Our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period, changes in the acquired entities performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These differences could be significant. The contingent purchase price obligations as of December 31, 2006, calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels, are as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total $164 $108 $77 $83 $16 $448 In addition, owners of interests in certain of our subsidiaries or affiliates have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional ownership interests in those companies. Assuming that the subsidiaries and affiliates perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels, the aggregate amount we could be required to pay in future periods is approximately $283 million, $193 million of which relates to obligations that are currently exercisable. If these rights are exercised, there would be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense. The ultimate amount payable relating to these transactions will vary because it is primarily dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses, the timing of the exercise of these rights and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The actual amount that we pay is likely to be different from this estimate and the difference could be significant. The obligations that exist for these agreements as of December 31, 2006, calculated using the assumptions above, are as follows: (Dollars in millions) Currently Exercisable Not Currently Exercisable Total Subsidiary agencies $145 $82 $227 Affiliated agencies 48 8 56 Total $193 $90 $283 23 Sources and Uses of Cash Our cash requirements have historically been funded by a combination of our operating cash flow and cash on hand, as well as points in time when we have opportunistically accessed the capital markets. Our capital market transactions have included issuing $1.0 billion in ten-year fixed rate notes in 2006 and convertible notes in an aggregate principle amount of $600.0 million, $900.0 million and $850.0 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of our shares and the repayment of maturing debt. On March 31, 2006, we entered into an agreement to purchase 5.5 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $458.7 million. We repurchased the shares under an accelerated share repurchase ( ASR ) program with a financial institution at $83.41 per share with an initial settlement date of April 3, 2006. The purchase was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our Senior Notes offering. During the second quarter of 2006, the financial institution purchased the 5.5 million shares of our common stock in the open market and we paid a settlement amount of $45.1 million, referred to as the purchase price adjustment, based upon the difference between the actual cost of the shares purchased by the financial institution of $91.61 per share and the initial purchase price of $83.41 per share. At December 31, 2006, we had $1,739.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had $2.5 billion in unused committed credit facilities available for immediate use to fund our cash needs. These credit facilities are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Our operating cash flow and access to the capital markets could be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control. Additionally, access to the capital markets could be impaired by adverse changes to the short and long-term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies. Standard and Poor Rating Service currently rates our long-term debt A-, Moody Investors Service rates our long-term debt Baa1 and Fitch Ratings rates our long-term debt A-. Our short-term debt credit ratings are A2, P2 and F2 by the respective agencies. Our outstanding Senior Notes, convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded. The interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities, however, will increase if our long-term debt credit rating is lowered. As described in Note 3, our committed bank facilities contain two financial covenants relating to cash flow and interest coverage, which we met by a significant margin as of December 31, 2006. We believe that our current financial condition provides us with the ability to readily access the capital markets. Also, our cash balances combined with our liquidity of short-term investments, operational cash flows and unused committed borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our foreseeable cash requirements, arising from working capital, outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and stock repurchases. Cash Management We manage our cash and liquidity centrally through treasury centers in North America and Europe. Each day, operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center. Likewise, operations that require funding will borrow funds from their regional treasury center. The treasury centers then aggregate the net position of the operating companies. The net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers. To the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity, they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit, our $2.5 billion committed bank facilities, or issue up to $1,500.0 million of U.S. Dollar-denominated commercial paper. This enables us to reduce our consolidated debt levels and minimize interest expense as well as centrally manage our exposure to foreign exchange. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $903.7 million and our short-term investments decreased by $184.8 million from the prior year. Short-term investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle, generally within one year. 24 We manage our net debt position, which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and short-term investments, centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above. Our net debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 decreased by $26.2 million as compared to the prior year-end, as summarized below (dollars in millions): 2006 2005 Debt: Bank loans (due less than 1 year) $ 10.5 $ 15.0 Commercial paper issued under $2.5 billion Revolver due June 23, 2011 Senior Notes due April 15, 2016 995.5 Convertible notes due February 7, 2031 847.0 847.0 Convertible notes due July 31, 2032 727.0 892.3 Convertible notes due June 15, 2033 39.4 600.0 Convertible notes due July 1, 2038 428.1 Other debt 18.8 19.3 Total Debt 3,066.3 2,373.6 Cash and short-term investments 1,928.8 1,209.9 Net Debt $1,137.5 $1,163.7 Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding our net debt position and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management. Debt Instruments, Guarantees and Related Covenants We maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to $2,500 million as described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. This credit facility is available to provide credit support for issuances under our $1,500.0 million commercial paper program, as well as to provide back-up liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us. We typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper or by borrowing under our short-term uncommitted lines of credit. Occasionally, we may draw down on our credit facility. During 2006, we issued and redeemed $13.6 billion of commercial paper. The average term of the commercial paper was 2.8 days. As of December 31, 2006, we had no commercial paper or bank loans outstanding under these credit facilities. At December 31, 2006, we had short-term bank loans of $10.5 million outstanding, which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries. These bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries bank agreements. Our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements. These financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated EBITDA (for these purposes, EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to no more than 3.0 times. In addition, they require us to maintain a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense of at least 5.0 times. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants, as our ratio of debt to EBITDA was 1.8 times and our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense was 13.4 times. In March 2006, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.90% Senior Notes due April 15, 2016. The gross proceeds from the issuance were $995.1 million. The gross proceeds less fees resulted in a 6.05% yield to maturity. The Senior Notes were issued by Omnicom Group Inc. and two of our wholly-owned finance subsidiaries, Omnicom Capital Inc. and Omnicom Finance Inc., as co-obligors similar to our Convertible Notes. The Senior Notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co-obligors. In June 2005, upon maturity, we redeemed our Euro-denominated bonds for $185.1 million. The bonds paid a fixed rate of 5.2% to maturity. At December 31, 2006, we had a total of $2,041.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding, including $847.0 million 2031 Notes that were issued in February 2001, $727.0 million 2032 Notes that were issued in March 2002, $39.4 million 2033 Notes that were issued in June 2003 and $428.1 million Zero Coupon Zero Yield Convertible Notes due 2038 ( 2038 Notes ) that were originally issued in June 2003 as 2033 Notes and were subsequently amended in June 2006 to become the 2038 Notes. 25 The holders of our 2031 Notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in February of each year. The holders of our 2032 Notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in August of each year. The holders of our 2033 Notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on June 15, 2008, 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and on each June 15 annually thereafter through June 15, 2032. The holders of our 2038 Notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on June 15, 2008, 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and on each June 15 annually thereafter through June 15, 2037. The 2031, 2032, 2033 and 2038 Notes are convertible, at specified ratios, only upon the occurrence of certain events, including: if our common shares trade above certain levels, if we effect extraordinary transactions or, in the case of the 2031 Notes and the 2032 Notes, if our long-term debt credit ratings are downgraded to BBB or lower by Standard & Poor Ratings Service, or Baa3 or lower by Moody Investors Service or in the case of the 2033 Notes and the 2038 Notes to BBB- or lower by S&P, and Ba1 or lower by Moody s. These events would not, however, result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder right to cause us to repurchase the notes. For additional information about the terms of these notes, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. In August 2005, we paid a supplemental interest payment of $33.5 million to qualified noteholders of our 2032 Notes, equal to $37.50 per $1,000 principal amount of notes, that did not put their notes back to us. The total supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a 12-month period to the next put date ending in August 2006 in accordance with EITF 96-19. In February 2006, we paid a supplemental interest payment of $39.2 million to qualified noteholders of our 2031 Notes that did not put their notes back to us. The total supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a 12-month period to the next put date in February 2007 in accordance with EITF 96-19. In June 2006, we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of $27.50 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2033 Notes that did not put their notes back to us and consented to the amendments to the notes and related indenture as of June 27, 2006. The principal amendment extended the maturity of the notes from June 15, 2033 to July 1, 2038. The additional amendments conformed other terms of the notes for the extension of the maturity date, as well as amending the comparable yield. On June 21, 2006, we repurchased $132.5 million of 2033 Notes that were put to us. With respect to the remaining $467.5 million of 2033 Notes as of June 30, 2006, noteholders holding a combined amount of $428.1 million consented to the amendments, were paid $27.50 per $1,000 note and their notes were amended. The total supplemental interest payment of $11.7 million is being amortized ratably over a 24-month period to the next put date in accordance with EITF 96-19. The remaining noteholders of the 2033 Notes, comprising $39.4 million aggregate principal amount of notes, did not consent to the amendments. As a result, these notes are still outstanding and were not amended and these noteholders were not paid the supplemental interest payment. The next put date for these notes is June 15, 2008. In July 2006, we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of $32.50 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to holders of our 2032 Notes as of August 1, 2006 that did not put their notes back to us. On August 4, 2006, we repurchased $165.2 million of our 2032 Notes that were put to us. With respect to the remaining $727.0 million of notes, noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment of $23.6 million on August 2, 2006 which is being amortized ratably over a 12-month period to the next put date in accordance with EITF 96-19. In February 2007, we did not pay a supplemental interest payment to qualified noteholders of our 2031 Notes. Additionally, none of the 2031 Notes were put back to us for repayment. 26 Our outstanding debt and amounts available under these facilities as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions) were as follows: Debt Outstanding Available Credit Bank loans (due in less than 1 year) $ 10.5 Commercial paper issued under $2.5 billion Revolver due June 23, 2011 $2,500.0 Senior Notes due April 15, 2016 995.5 Convertible notes due February 7, 2031 847.0 Convertible notes due July 31, 2032 727.0 Convertible notes due June 15, 2033 39.4 Convertible notes due July 1, 2038 428.1 Other debt 18.8 Total $3,066.3 $2,500.0 Additional information about our indebtedness is included in Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
