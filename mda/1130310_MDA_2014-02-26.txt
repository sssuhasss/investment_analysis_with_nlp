Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company. Our operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities and natural gas distribution facilities and own interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP (Enable) as described below. Our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes the city of Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states (Gas Operations). A wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. As of December 31, 2013, CERC Corp. also owned approximately 58.3% of the limited partner interests in Enable, an unconsolidated partnership jointly controlled with OGE Energy Corp., which owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets. Business Segments In this Management Discussion and Analysis, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. The results of our Midstream Investments segment are dependent upon the results of Enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that Enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems and other factors as discussed below under - Factors Influencing Our Midstream Investments Segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2013 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving over two million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately six million people and includes the city of Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout CenterPoint Houston certificated service territory. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers, river authorities and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission). Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.3 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. 41 Energy Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in 21 states in the central and eastern regions of the United States. Midstream Investments We have a significant equity investment in Enable, an unconsolidated subsidiary that owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil assets. Our Midstream Investments segment includes equity earnings associated with the operations of Enable and a 25.05% interest in SESH currently owned by CERC. Other Operations Our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Factors Influencing Our Businesses We are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries. We do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end-use electric customers. To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, operation and maintenance expense, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. We also monitor system reliability, safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance. To the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. Reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Performance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer. Weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage, and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis. The Houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during 2011. In 2012, we experienced a return to more normal weather in the summer months. However, every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record. In 2013, we experienced a colder than normal spring and very cold weather in November and December in Houston and all of the states in which we have gas customers. In recent years, customers have typically reduced their energy consumption, and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results. However, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve. In addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and in Minnesota, we have benefited from a growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption. We anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions economies resume typical growth. The profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates. Our Energy Services business segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis. Its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the United States. The segment benefits from favorable price differentials, either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis. While this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements, it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level, or VaR, to avoid significant financial exposures. Lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2013, 2012 and 2011 adversely affected results for this business segment. The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of 42 debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. We expect to make contributions to our pension plan aggregating approximately $87 million in 2014 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years. Consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs, we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment and our Gas Operations in Texas. Factors Influencing Our Midstream Investments Segment The results of our Midstream Investments segment are primarily dependent upon the results of Enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that Enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems, which depends significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to its systems. Aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity, as production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity, because the production rate of a natural gas well declines over time. Producers willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of natural gas and NGLs, the cost to drill and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations. The level of drilling is expected to positively correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity. To maintain and increase gathering throughput volumes on its systems, Enable must continue to contract its capacity to shippers, including producers and marketers. Enable transportation and storage systems compete for customers based on the type of service a customer needs, operating flexibility, receipt and delivery points and geographic flexibility and available capacity and price. To maintain and increase Enable transportation and storage volumes, it must continue to contract its capacity to shippers, including producers, marketers, LDCs, power generators and end-users. Enable operation and maintenance expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses, lease costs, utility costs, insurance premiums and repairs and maintenance expenses. These expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses. The current high levels of crude oil exploration, development and production activities are increasing competition for personnel and equipment. This increased competition is placing upward pressure on the prices Enable pays for labor, supplies and miscellaneous equipment. To the extent Enable is unable to procure necessary services or offset higher costs, its operating results will be negatively affected. Our Midstream Investments segment currently includes a 25.05% interest in SESH owned by CERC that may be contributed by CERC to Enable in the future, upon exercise of certain put or call rights under which CERC would contribute to Enable CERC retained interest in SESH at a price equal to the fair market value of such interest at the time the put right or call right is exercised (which may be no earlier than May 2014 and May 2015 for a 24.95% and a 0.1% interest, respectively). If CERC were to exercise such put right or Enable were to exercise such call right, CERC retained interest in SESH would be contributed to Enable in exchange for consideration consisting of a certain number of limited partnership units in Enable (subject to certain antidilution adjustments) for a 24.95% and a 0.1% interest in SESH, respectively, and, subject to certain restrictions, a cash payment, payable either from CERC to Enable or from Enable to CERC for changes in the value of SESH. Significant Events Enable Midstream Partners. On March 14, 2013, we entered into a Master Formation Agreement (MFA) with OGE Energy Corp. (OGE) and affiliates of ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (ArcLight), pursuant to which we, OGE and ArcLight agreed to form Enable Midstream Partners, LP (Enable) as a private limited partnership. On May 1, 2013, the parties closed on the formation of Enable pursuant to the terms of the MFA. In connection with the closing (i) CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC) converted its direct wholly owned subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy Field Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (CEFS), into a Delaware limited partnership that became Enable, (ii) CERC Corp. contributed to Enable its equity interests in each of CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Company, LLC, which has been subsequently renamed Enable Gas Transmission, LLC (EGT), CenterPoint Energy - Mississippi River Transmission, LLC, which has been subsequently renamed Enable Mississippi River Transmission, LLC (MRT), certain of its other midstream subsidiaries, and a 24.95% interest in Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH), and (iii) OGE and ArcLight indirectly contributed 100% of the equity interests in Enogex LLC, which has been subsequently renamed Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission, LLC, to Enable. Enable 43 owns substantially all of our former Interstate Pipelines and Field Services business segments, except for our retained 25.05% interest in SESH. As of December 31, 2013, CERC Corp., OGE and ArcLight held approximately 58.3%, 28.5% and 13.2%, respectively, of the limited partner interests in Enable. Enable is equally controlled by CERC Corp. and OGE; each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of Enable. CERC Corp. and OGE also own a 40% and 60% interest, respectively, in the incentive distribution rights held by the general partner of Enable. On May 1, 2013, Enable (i) entered into a $1.05 billion three-year senior unsecured term loan facility, (ii) repaid $1.05 billion of indebtedness owed to CERC, and (iii) entered into a $1.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As a result of the formation of Enable, we no longer have Interstate Pipelines or Field Services business segments. Enable is an unconsolidated subsidiary which we account for on an equity basis. Equity earnings associated with our interest in Enable and our retained 25.05% interest in SESH are reported under our Midstream Investments segment. For a further description of our reportable business segments, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Debt Matters. In March 2013, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston) retired $450 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.70% general mortgage bonds at their maturity. In April 2013, CERC Corp. retired approximately $365 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% senior notes at their maturity. The retirement of senior notes was financed by CERC Corp. with the issuance of commercial paper. In May 2013, CERC Corp. applied proceeds from Enable's May 1, 2013 debt repayment of $1.05 billion to the repayment of $357 million aggregate principal amount of its commercial paper and to the May 31, 2013 redemption of $160 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.95% senior notes due January 15, 2014 at 103.419% of their aggregate principal amount. On August 1, 2013, approximately $92 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf were redeemed at 101% of their aggregate principal amount. These bonds had an interest rate of 4%, a maturity date of August 1, 2015 and were collateralized by first mortgage bonds of CenterPoint Houston. On September 9, 2013, our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facilities of CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. were amended to, among other things, (i) reduce the size of the CERC Corp. facility from $950 million to $600 million, (ii) extend the scheduled termination dates of the three facilities from September 9, 2016 to September 9, 2018, and (iii) change the financial covenant in our facility to a covenant that limits our consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of our consolidated capitalization (subject to a temporary increase to 70% of our consolidated capitalization under certain circumstances described therein). On October 15, 2013, approximately $59 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf were redeemed at 101% of their aggregate principal amount. These bonds had an interest rate of 4%, a maturity date of October 15, 2015 and were collateralized by first mortgage bonds of CenterPoint Houston. In January 2014, approximately $44 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of CenterPoint Houston were called for redemption on March 3, 2014 at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest. The bonds have an interest rate of 4.25%, mature in 2017 and are collateralized by general mortgage bonds of CenterPoint Houston. In February 2014, notice was given that approximately $56 million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on behalf of CenterPoint Houston must be tendered for purchase by CenterPoint Houston on March 3, 2014 at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. The bonds have an interest rate of 5.60%, mature in 2027 and are collateralized by general mortgage bonds of CenterPoint Houston. The purchased pollution control bonds will remain outstanding and may be remarketed. 44 CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations.

Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Revenues $ 8,106 $ 7,452 $ 8,450 Expenses 7,096 6,414 7,152 Operating Income 1,010 1,038 1,298 Gain on Marketable Securities 236 154 19 Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities (193 ) (71 ) 35 Interest and Other Finance Charges (351 ) (422 ) (456 ) Interest on Transition and System Restoration Bonds (133 ) (147 ) (127 ) Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 188 31 30 Return on True-Up Balance 352 Step acquisition gain 136 Other Income, net 24 38 23 Income Before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Item 781 757 1,174 Income Tax Expense 470 340 404 Income Before Extraordinary Item 311 417 770 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 587 Net Income $ 311 $ 417 $ 1,357 Basic Earnings Per Share: Income Before Extraordinary Item $ 0.73 $ 0.98 $ 1.81 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 1.38 Net Income $ 0.73 $ 0.98 $ 3.19 Diluted Earnings Per Share: Income Before Extraordinary Item $ 0.72 $ 0.97 $ 1.80 Extraordinary Item, net of tax 1.37 Net Income $ 0.72 $ 0.97 $ 3.17 2013 Compared to 2012 Net Income. We reported net income of $311 million ( $0.72 per diluted share) for 2013 compared to $417 million ($0.97 per diluted share) for the same period in 2012. The decrease in net income of $106 million was primarily due to a $136 million non-cash step acquisition gain related to the acquisition of an additional 50% interest in Waskom in 2012, a $130 million increase in income tax expense discussed below, a $122 million increase in the loss on our indexed debt securities and a $28 million decrease in operating income (discussed below by segment). Operating income in 2012 included a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. These decreases were partially offset by a $157 million increase in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, a $85 million decrease in interest expense and a $82 million increase in the gain on our marketable securities. Income Tax Expense. We reported an effective tax rate of 60.2% for 2013 compared to 44.9% for the same period in 2012. Our effective tax rate for 2013 increased by 15.3% primarily as a result of the formation of Enable with deferred tax expense of $225 million related to the book-to-tax basis difference for contributed non-tax deductible goodwill and a tax benefit of $29 million associated with the remeasurement of state deferred taxes at formation. In addition, we recognized a tax benefit of $8 million based on the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of outstanding tax claims for the 2002 and 2003 audit cycles. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 36.2% excluding the tax effects from the adjustments described above. 47 Our effective tax rate for 2012 of 44.9% was primarily impacted by an increase in tax expense of $88 million related to the non-tax deductible impairment of goodwill of $252 million and a reduction in tax expense of $28 million for the release of tax reserves settled with the IRS. Our effective tax rate for 2012 was approximately 37% excluding the tax effects from the adjustments described above. 2012 Compared to 2011 Net Income. We reported net income of $417 million ($0.97 per diluted share) for 2012 compared to $1.357 billion ($3.17 per diluted share) for the same period in 2011. The decrease in net income of $940 million was primarily due to the resolution in 2011 of the true-up appeal resulting in an after-tax extraordinary gain of $587 million and a $352 million return on the true-up balance, a $260 million decrease in operating income (discussed by segment below), including a $252 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, and a $106 million increase in the loss on our indexed debt securities, which were partially offset by a $136 million non-cash step acquisition gain related to the acquisition of an additional 50% interest in Waskom, a $135 million increase in the gain on our marketable securities, a $64 million decrease in income tax expense and a $14 million decrease in interest expense due to lower levels of debt. Income Tax Expense. We reported an effective tax rate of 44.9% for 2012 compared to 34.4% for the same period in 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate of 10.5% is due to goodwill impairment of $252 million which is non-deductible for tax purposes. It is partially offset by favorable tax adjustments, including the re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits of $28 million related to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) settlement of tax years 2006 through 2009. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (loss) (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .

Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $607 million for 2013, consisting of $474 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $133 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2012, operating income totaled $639 million, consisting of $492 million from the TDU and $147 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. TDU operating income decreased $18 million due to decreased usage ($13 million), primarily due to unfavorable weather, increased taxes other than income taxes ($11 million), increased depreciation ($10 million, excluding $8 million from increased investment in AMS offset by the related revenues), increased labor and benefits costs ($7 million), increased contracts and services ($4 million), increased support services ($4 million) and increased insurance costs ($3 million), partially offset by customer growth ($26 million) from the addition of over 44,000 new customers and higher transmission-related revenues net of the costs billed by transmission providers ($9 million). 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $639 million for 2012, consisting of $492 million from the TDU and $147 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2011, operating income totaled $623 million, consisting of $496 million from the TDU and $127 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. TDU operating income decreased $4 million due to decreased usage ($54 million), primarily due to a return to more normal summer weather when compared to the previous year, and the impact of the 2010 rate case implemented in September 2011 ($34 million), partially offset by higher equity returns ($28 million) primarily related to true-up proceeds, increased miscellaneous revenues ($24 million), primarily from right-of-way easement grants, customer growth ($24 million) from the addition of over 44,000 new customers and decreased labor and benefits costs ($6 million). 49 Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Revenues $ 2,863 $ 2,342 $ 2,841 Expenses: Natural gas 1,607 1,196 1,675 Operation and maintenance 667 637 655 Depreciation and amortization 185 173 166 Taxes other than income taxes 141 110 119 Total expenses 2,600 2,116 2,615 Operating Income $ 263 $ 226 $ 226 Throughput (in Bcf): Residential 182 140 172 Commercial and industrial 265 243 251 Total Throughput 447 383 423 Number of customers at end of period: Residential 3,090,966 3,058,695 3,036,267 Commercial and industrial 247,100 246,413 246,220 Total 3,338,066 3,305,108 3,282,487 2013 Compared to 2012. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $263 million for 2013 compared to $226 million for 2012. Operating income increased $37 million primarily due to increased usage as a result of colder weather compared to the prior year, partially mitigated by weather hedges and weather normalization adjustments ($29 million), rate increases ($29 million), and increased economic activity across our footprint including the addition of approximately 33,000 residential customers ($7 million). These increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses ($6 million), higher bad debt expense ($5 million), higher depreciation and amortization expense ($12 million) and an increase in taxes ($5 million), primarily attributable to property taxes. Increased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($17 million) and increased expense related to higher gross receipt taxes ($26 million) were offset by a corresponding increase in the related revenues. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $226 million for each of 2012 and 2011. Operating income was unchanged despite substantially reduced revenues from near record mild temperatures in the first quarter of 2012 that were partially mitigated by weather hedges and weather normalization adjustments ($21 million), increased depreciation and amortization expense ($7 million) and increased property taxes ($4 million). These adverse impacts were offset by certain reduced operation and maintenance expenses ($5 million), lower bad debt expense ($7 million), the addition of over 22,000 customers ($6 million) and rate increases ($12 million). Decreased expense related to energy efficiency programs ($4 million) and decreased expense related to lower gross receipts taxes ($12 million) were offset by a corresponding reduction in the related revenues. 50 Energy Services The following table provides summary data of our Energy Services business segment for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Revenues $ 2,401 $ 1,784 $ 2,511 Expenses: Natural gas 2,336 1,730 2,458 Operation and maintenance 46 45 41 Depreciation and amortization 5 6 5 Taxes other than income taxes 1 1 1 Goodwill impairment 252 Total expenses 2,388 2,034 2,505 Operating Income (Loss) $ 13 $ (250 ) $ 6 Throughput (in Bcf) 600 562 558 Number of customers at end of period (1) 17,510 16,330 14,267 ___________________ (1) These numbers do not include approximately 8,800 and 12,700 natural gas customers as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, that are under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility. 2013 Compared to 2012. Our Energy Services business segment reported operating income of $13 million compared to $2 million for 2012, excluding the goodwill impairment charge discussed below. The increase in operating income of $11 million was primarily due to a $14 million positive impact from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. A $2 million mark-to-market charge was incurred in 2013 compared to a charge of $16 million for 2012. Energy Services grew both volume and customers in 2013 offsetting the impact of the lower unit margin environment. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Energy Services business segment reported operating income, excluding the goodwill impairment discussed below, of $2 million for 2012 compared to $6 million for 2011. The decrease in operating income of $4 million was primarily due to a $24 million negative impact of mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. 2012 included mark-to-market charges of $16 million compared to an $8 million benefit for the same period of 2011. Substantially offsetting this decrease was a $20 million improvement in operating margins primarily as a result of the termination of uneconomic transportation contracts and an increase in retail sales customers and volumes. Goodwill Impairment A non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million for our Energy Services business segment was recorded in 2012. The adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business, specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas, led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit. 51 Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2013 (1) 2012 2011 Revenues $ 186 $ 502 $ 553 Expenses: Natural gas 35 57 67 Operation and maintenance 51 153 152 Depreciation and amortization 20 56 54 Taxes other than income taxes 8 29 32 Total expenses 114 295 305 Operating Income $ 72 $ 207 $ 248 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 7 $ 26 $ 21 Transportation throughput (in Bcf) 482 1,367 1,579 _____________ (1) Represents January 2013 through April 2013 results only. 2013 Compared to 2012. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $72 million for 2013 compared to $207 million for 2012. Substantially all of this segment was contributed to Enable on May 1, 2013. As a result, 2013 is not comparable to the prior year. Effective May 1, 2013, our equity method investment and related equity income in Enable are included in our Midstream Investments segment. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $207 million for 2012 compared to $248 million for 2011. Operating income decreased $41 million primarily due to lower margins resulting from a backhaul contract that expired in 2011 ($16 million), as well as the associated reduction in compressor efficiency ($8 million) on the Carthage to Perryville pipeline due to lower volumes, lower off-system transportation revenues ($8 million), lower seasonal and market-sensitive transportation contracts ($7 million) and ancillary services ($7 million). These margin decreases were partially offset by the effects of the 10-year agreement with our natural gas distribution affiliate ($5 million) which we restructured in 2010. Operating income decreases due to higher operations and maintenance expenses ($1 million) and higher depreciation and amortization expenses ($2 million) due to asset additions were offset by lower taxes other than income taxes ($3 million). Equity Earnings. This business segment recorded equity income of $7 million , $26 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, from its interest in Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH), a jointly-owned pipeline. The decrease from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily due to the contribution of a 24.95% interest in SESH to Enable on May 1, 2013. Beginning May 1, 2013, equity earnings related to the interest in SESH contributed to Enable, as well as our remaining 25.05% interest in SESH, are reported as components of equity income in our Midstream Investments segment. 52 Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2013 (1) 2012 2011 Revenues $ 196 $ 506 $ 412 Expenses: Natural gas 54 122 68 Operation and maintenance 45 115 112 Depreciation and amortization 20 50 37 Taxes other than income taxes 4 5 6 Total expenses 123 292 223 Operating Income $ 73 $ 214 $ 189 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ $ 5 $ 9 Gathering throughput (in Bcf) 252 896 823 _____________ (1) Represents January 2013 through April 2013 results only. 2013 Compared to 2012. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $73 million for 2013 compared to $214 million for 2012. Substantially all of this segment was contributed to Enable on May 1, 2013. As a result, 2013 is not comparable to the prior year. Effective May 1, 2013, our equity method investment and related equity income in Enable are included in our Midstream Investments segment. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $214 million for 2012 compared to $189 million for 2011. Operating income increased $25 million primarily from increased margins ($36 million) due to gathering projects in the Haynesville shale, including revenues from throughput guarantees, growth in gathering services and retained natural gas volumes, and acquisitions completed during 2012 ($13 million), partially offset by lower commodity prices ($28 million) on sales of retained natural gas. Operating income also increased ($3 million) due to the classification of earnings from the 50% partnership interest in Waskom which we already owned as operating income beginning in August 2012 instead of equity earnings as reported for prior periods, due to our July 31, 2012 purchase of the 50% interest in Waskom that we did not already own. Lower operation and maintenance expenses ($7 million) were partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6 million). Equity Earnings. This business segment recorded equity income of $-0- , $5 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, from its interest in Waskom. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption in the Statements of Consolidated Income. From August 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, financial results for Waskom are included in operating income. On May 1, 2013, our 100% investment in Waskom was contributed to Enable. Midstream Investments During the eight months ended December 31, 2013, we reported pre-tax equity income of $173 million from our 58.3% limited partner interest in Enable and $8 million of pre-tax equity income from our 25.05% interest in SESH. Enable gathering and processing operations in 2013 were positively impacted by increases in gross margin resulting from acquisitions, higher gathering and processing fixed-fee volumes, higher natural gas prices and increased processing margins, partially offset by a decline in customer volumes, a decline in NGL price spreads between Conway and Mont Belvieu, and the conversion of a processing contract from keep-whole to fixed-fee. Enable transportation and storage operations in 2013 were adversely impacted by a decline in gross margins attributable to lower volumes, primarily due to lower price differentials, which negatively impacted margins on ancillary services, a reduction in liquid sales, a reduction to margins on off-system transportation revenues, a decline in interruptible transportation fees, and a reduction to storage demand fees. 53 Cash distributions received from Enable and SESH were approximately $106 million and $6 million, respectively, during the eight months ended December 31, 2013 . Enable Operating Data during the eight months ended December 31, 2013 Eight Months Ended December 31, 2013 Natural gas gathered volumes - Trillion British Thermal Units per day (TBtu/d) 3.49 Natural gas transportation volumes - TBtu/d 4.58 Natural gas processed volumes - TBtu/d 1.45 Natural gas liquids sold - Gallons per day 2.61 Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Revenues $ 14 $ 11 $ 11 Expenses 32 9 5 Operating Income (Loss) $ (18 ) $ 2 $ 6 2013 Compared to 2012. Our Other Operations business segment reported an operating loss of $18 million for 2013 compared to operating income of $2 million for 2012. The decrease in operating income of $20 million is primarily related to the costs associated with the formation of Enable ($13 million), higher depreciation expense ($3 million) and higher property taxes ($2 million). LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flows The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,613 $ 1,860 $ 1,888 Investing activities (1,300 ) (1,603 ) (1,206 ) Financing activities (751 ) 169 (661 ) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $247 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to decreased operating income ($280 million), excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $252 million, decreased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ( $108 million ), cash related to gas storage inventory ($43 million), decreased net margin deposits ( $37 million ), decreased cash from non-trading derivatives ( $16 million ), increased pension contributions ($9 million) and decreased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ( $5 million ), which was partially offset by increased cash provided by fuel cost recovery ( $160 million ), increased distributions from equity method investments ($91 million) and decreased net tax payments ( $11 million ). Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $28 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased net tax payments ($251 million), which was partially offset by increased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($45 million), increased cash provided by net regulatory assets and liabilities ($35 million), increased cash from non-trading derivative 54 ($33 million), increased cash related to gas storage inventory ($25 million), decreased net margin deposits ($19 million) and increased cash provided by fuel cost recovery ($18 million). Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $303 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to decreased cash paid for acquisitions ( $360 million ) and decreased restricted cash ( $30 million ) and increased proceeds from sale of marketable securities ( $9 million ), which were partially offset by increased capital expenditures ( $74 million ) and cash contributed to Enable ( $38 million ). Net cash used in investing activities increased $397 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to increased cash paid for acquisitions ($360 million) and decreased cash received from the DOE grant ($110 million), which were partially offset by decreased capital expenditures ($91 million). Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased $920 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to decreased proceeds from long-term debt ( $1,445 million ) and increased payments of common stock dividends ( $9 million ), which were partially offset by increased proceeds from commercial paper ( $403 million ), decreased cash paid for debt retirement ( $62 million ), increased short-term borrowings ( $29 million ), decreased payments of long-term debt ( $17 million ) and decreased debt issuance costs ( $13 million ). Net cash provided by financing activities increased $830 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased proceeds from long-term debt ($1,945 million) and decreased debt issuance costs ($8 million), which were partially offset by increased payments of long-term debt ($681 million), increased payments of commercial paper ($387 million), decreased short-term borrowings ($33 million), increased cash paid for debt retirement ($11 million) and increased payments of common stock dividends ($9 million). Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. Our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2014 include the following: capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion; scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds of $354 million; the expected March 2014 purchase and redemption of pollution control bonds aggregating approximately $100 million at 101% of their principal amount; pension contributions aggregating approximately $87 million; and dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on debt. We expect that anticipated 2014 cash needs will be met with borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper, proceeds from the issuance of general mortgage bonds, anticipated cash flows from operations, and distributions from Enable. Discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. 55 The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2013 and estimates of our capital expenditures for currently identified or planned projects for 2014 through 2018 (in millions): 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Electric Transmission & Distribution $ 759 $ 781 $ 833 $ 718 $ 655 $ 666 Natural Gas Distribution 430 521 491 401 421 404 Energy Services 3 10 19 36 11 11 Interstate Pipelines (1) 29 Field Services (1) 16 Other Operations 35 62 47 43 53 52 Total $ 1,272 $ 1,374 $ 1,390 $ 1,198 $ 1,140 $ 1,133 (1) Following the formation of Enable on May 1, 2013, substantially all of the assets of CenterPoint Energy's former Interstate Pipelines and Field Services business segments are owned by Enable. Our capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure for our electric transmission and distribution operations and our natural gas distribution operations. These capital expenditures are anticipated to maintain reliability and safety as well as expand our systems through value-added projects. The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 2019 and thereafter Transition and system restoration bond debt $ 3,400 $ 354 $ 763 $ 845 $ 1,438 Other long-term debt (1) 5,533 593 1,396 3,544 Interest payments transition and system restoration bond debt (2) 594 119 203 146 126 Interest payments other long-term debt (2) 3,433 286 538 435 2,174 Short-term borrowings 43 43 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases (3) 21 6 8 4 3 Benefit obligations (4) Non-trading derivative liabilities 21 17 4 Other commodity commitments (5) 1,723 408 701 494 120 Total contractual cash obligations (6) $ 14,769 $ 1,233 $ 2,810 $ 3,320 $ 7,406 ___________________ (1) 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) obligations are included in the 2019 and thereafter column at their contingent principal amount as of December 31, 2013 of $763 million. These obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS ($767 million at December 31, 2013 ), as discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. (2) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2013 . We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 14(c) to our consolidated financial statements. (4) In 2014, we expect to make contributions to our qualified pension plan aggregating approximately $87 million. We expect to contribute approximately $9 million and $17 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2014. (5) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 14(a) to our consolidated financial statements. 56 (6) This table does not include estimated future payments for expected future asset retirement obligations. These payments are primarily estimated to be incurred after 2019. We record a separate liability for the fair value of these asset retirement obligations which totaled $134 million as of December 31, 2013. See Note 3(c), Asset Retirement Obligation in our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Prior to the distribution of our ownership in Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI) to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guarantees RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation. Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn)) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC obligations under its remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December. The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $58 million as of December 31, 2013 . Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2013 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security. If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC obligations. CenterPoint Energy, Inc. has provided guarantees (CenterPoint Midstream Guarantees) with respect to the performance of certain obligations of Enable under long-term gas gathering and treating agreements with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Encana Corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc. As of December 31, 2013 , CenterPoint Energy, Inc. had guaranteed Enable's obligations up to an aggregate amount of $100 million under these agreements. Under the terms of the omnibus agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the formation of Enable, Enable and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to terminate the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantees, and to release CenterPoint Energy, Inc. from such guarantees by causing Enable or one of its subsidiaries to enter into substitute guarantees or to assume the CenterPoint Midstream Guarantees as applicable. CERC Corp. has also provided a guarantee of collection of Enable's obligations under its $1.05 billion three-year unsecured term loan facility, which guarantee is subordinated to all senior debt of CERC Corp. As of December 31, 2013, no amounts have been recorded related to the guarantees discussed above in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other than the guarantees discussed above and operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Regulatory Matters CenterPoint Houston In October 2009, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission) issued an order disallowing recovery of a performance bonus of $2 million on approximately $10 million in 2008 energy efficiency costs expended pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement in a prior rate case. CenterPoint Houston appealed the denial of the full 2008 performance bonus. Similar orders by the Texas Utility Commission providing for the partial disallowance of performance bonuses totaling approximately $5.5 million relating to CenterPoint Houston 2009, 2010 and 2011 (only through August 2011) energy efficiency programs were also appealed. These subsequent cases were abated pending the final outcome of the 2008 bonus appeal. In August 2013, the court of appeals reversed the Texas Utility Commission decision disallowing such bonuses and the Texas Utility Commission appealed that decision to the Texas Supreme Court in October 2013. In January 2014, the Texas Supreme Court denied the Texas Utility Commission's appeal. CenterPoint Houston energy efficiency programs are no longer funded pursuant to the terms of the prior settlement, and no additional performance bonus disallowances are expected. In December 2013, CenterPoint Houston filed an application at the Texas Utility Commission seeking (i) to reconcile approximately $473 million in Advanced Metering System costs incurred during the time period April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2013 and currently in rates, and (ii) approval to amend the surcharge recovery period to account for the reconciled costs through September 30, 2013 as well as to recover costs expected to be incurred after September 30, 2013. A decision by the Texas Utility Commission is expected later this year. 57 Gas Operations City of Houston Settlement. In January 2013, the City of Houston initiated a rate proceeding against Gas Operations claiming regulatory disclosures indicated that Gas Operations was earning more on an annual basis than authorized. In February 2014, Gas Operations and City of Houston agreed (i) to terminate the rate proceeding, and (ii) that Gas Operations would not seek a base rate increase before Fall 2016. Houston and South Texas Gas Reliability Infrastructure Programs (GRIP) . The natural gas distribution business of CERC (Gas Operations) Houston and South Texas Divisions each submitted annual GRIP filings on March 28, 2013. For the Houston Division, the filing was to recover costs related to $55.8 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2012. The increase in revenue requirements for this filing period is $10.7 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.65%. For the South Texas Division, the filing was to recover costs related to $17.5 million in incremental capital expenditures that were incurred in 2012. The increase in revenue requirements for this filing period is $2.9 million annually based on an authorized rate of return of 8.75%. Rates were completely implemented by July 2013. Arkansas Billing Determinant Rate Adjustment Tariff (BDA) Filing. Gas Operations Arkansas Division made its annual BDA filing with the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) on March 27, 2013 to request recovery of a calendar year 2012 shortfall of $6.8 million. No exceptions were noted by the APSC staff and the revised rates went into effect on June 1, 2013. Mississippi Rate Regulation Adjustment Rider (RRA) . Gas Operations Mississippi Division submitted an annual RRA filing with the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) on May 1, 2013 to request recovery of a calendar year 2012 earnings shortfall of approximately $3.2 million. The MPSC approved approximately $2.9 million, and the revised rates went into effect in July 2013. Cost of Service Adjustment (COSA) Rate Adjustments. In March 2008, Gas Operations filed a request to change its rates with the Railroad Commission of Texas (Railroad Commission) and the 47 cities in its Texas Coast service territory, including a request for an annual cost of service adjustment mechanism, or COSA, that adjusts rates annually for changes in invested capital as well as certain operating expenses. In 2008, the Railroad Commission approved the implementation of rates increasing annual revenues from the Texas Coast service territory by approximately $3.5 million. The approved rates were contested by a coalition of nine cities in an appeal to the 353rd district court in Travis County, Texas. In 2010, the district court ruled that the Railroad Commission lacked authority to impose the approved COSA mechanism both in those nine cities and in those areas in which the Railroad Commission has original jurisdiction. The decision by the District Court placed at risk certain revenues collected pursuant to COSA mechanisms. The Railroad Commission and Gas Operations appealed the court's ruling on the COSA mechanism. In January 2014, the Texas Supreme Court confirmed that the Railroad Commission had authority to approve the COSA rate adjustments utilized by Gas Operations and remanded the case back to state district court. Minneapolis Franchise. Gas Operations currently provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 124,000 customers in Minneapolis, Minnesota under a franchise that is due to expire at the end of 2014. In June 2013, the Minneapolis City Council (City Council) voted to hold public hearings on August 1, 2013 to consider (i) authorizing the establishment of a municipal electric utility and authorizing the city to own, operate, construct and extend electric facilities and acquire the property of any existing electric public utility operating within Minneapolis, and (ii) authorizing the establishment of a municipal gas utility and authorizing the city to own, operate, construct and extend gas and similar facilities and acquire the property of any existing gas public utility operating within Minneapolis. On August 16, 2013, the City Council voted not to conduct a special election on the question of whether the city should be authorized to establish a municipal utility. Additionally, the City Council directed city staff to begin negotiations with Gas Operations on a franchise renewal and to work to complete the franchise agreement by June 2014. Minnesota Rate Proceeding. On August 2, 2013, Gas Operations filed a general rate case in Minnesota to increase overall revenue $44.3 million annually, based on a rate base of $700 million and return on equity (ROE) of 10.3%. In compliance with state law, Gas Operations implemented interim rates reflecting $42.9 million dollars of the requested increase for gas used on and after October 1, 2013. Evidentiary hearings were held before an Administrative Law Judge in January 2014, and Gas Operations expects a final decision from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in its rate proceeding in mid-summer 2014. This rate filing is intended to recover significant capital expenditures Gas Operations is making in Minnesota and includes moving $15.0 million of energy efficiency expenditures into base rates. 58 Enable Midstream Partners In August 2012, MRT, a subsidiary of Enable and an interstate pipeline that provides natural gas transportation, natural gas storage and pipeline services to customers principally in Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri, made a rate filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. In its filing, MRT requested an annual cost of service of $104 million (an increase of approximately $48 million above the annual cost of service underlying the current FERC approved maximum rates for MRT's pipeline), new depreciation rates, an overall rate of return of 10.813% (based on a ROE of 13.62%), a regulatory compliance cost (RCC) surcharge with a true-up mechanism to recover safety, environmental, and security costs associated with mandated requirements and billing determinants reflecting no adjustments for MRT's conversion of a portion of EGT's firm capacity to a lease. On July 30, 2013, MRT filed with the FERC an uncontested Stipulation and Agreement and Offer of Settlement, resolving all issues in the rate case. In particular, MRT withdrew its proposed RCC surcharge. The settlement specifies few particulars, other than setting an annual overall cost-of-service for MRT of $84.0 million and increasing the depreciation rates for certain asset classes. In September 2013, the FERC approved the settlement. Although the settlement became effective November 1, 2013, the settlement rates are effective as of March 1, 2013. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2013, MRT made refunds to certain of its customers totaling approximately $5.9 million, which had previously been reserved. Other Matters Credit Facilities As of February 14, 2014 , we had the following facilities (in millions): Date Executed Company Size of Facility Amount Utilized at February 14, 2014 (1) Termination Date September 9, 2011 CenterPoint Energy $ 1,200 $ 6 (2) September 9, 2018 September 9, 2011 CenterPoint Houston 300 4 (2) September 9, 2018 September 9, 2011 CERC Corp. 600 September 9, 2018 ___________________ (1) Based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facility of each of CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp., we would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated $2.1 billion at December 31, 2013 . (2) Represents outstanding letters of credit. Our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility can be drawn at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 125 basis points based on our current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits our consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of our consolidated capitalization. The financial covenant limit will temporarily increase from 65% to 70% if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that CenterPoint Houston has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a consecutive twelve-month period, all or part of which CenterPoint Houston intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of our certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. CenterPoint Houston $300 million revolving credit facility can be drawn at LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits CenterPoint Houston consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of CenterPoint Houston's consolidated capitalization. CERC Corp. $600 million revolving credit facility can be drawn at LIBOR plus 150 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant which limits CERC consolidated debt to an amount not to exceed 65% of CERC consolidated capitalization. Borrowings under each of the three revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities 59 are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the three revolving credit facilities, the spread to LIBOR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower credit rating. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the three revolving credit facilities. On April 11, 2013, we amended our revolving credit facility and CERC Corp. amended its revolving credit facility to add exceptions to each borrower covenants which restrict (i) the consolidation, merger or disposal of assets and (ii) the sale of stock in certain significant subsidiaries, in each case to permit the transactions contemplated in the formation of Enable. On September 9, 2013, our revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facilities of CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. were amended to, among other things, (i) reduce the size of the CERC Corp. facility from $950 million to $600 million, (ii) extend the scheduled termination dates of the three facilities from September 9, 2016 to September 9, 2018, and (iii) change the financial covenant in our facility to a covenant that limits our consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of our consolidated capitalization (subject to a temporary increase to 70% of our consolidated capitalization under certain circumstances described therein). Our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility backstops our $1.0 billion commercial paper program. CERC Corp.'s $600 million revolving credit facility backstops its $600 million commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2013 , CERC Corp had $118 million of outstanding commercial paper. Securities Registered with the SEC CenterPoint Energy, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. have filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of CenterPoint Houston general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp. senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of CenterPoint Energy shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. Temporary Investments As of February 14, 2014 , CERC Corp. had temporary investments in a money market fund of $104 million . Money Pool We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings The interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on our credit rating. As of February 14, 2014 , Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook (1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 Stable BBB+ Stable BBB Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt A1 Stable A Stable A Stable CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa2 Stable A- Stable BBB Stable ___________________ (1) A Moody rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. 60 (3) A Fitch rating outlook encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. We cannot assure you that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $300 million revolving credit facility and CERC Corp. $600 million revolving credit facility. If our credit ratings or those of CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at December 31, 2013 , the impact on the borrowing costs under the three revolving credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $140 million based on CERC Corp.'s S&P senior unsecured long-term debt rating of A-. Under these agreements, CERC may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded or if the S&P senior unsecured long-term debt rating is downgraded below BBB+. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Energy Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2013 , the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $5 million. Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2013 , unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $308 million and $1 million of such amount was utilized. Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $180 million as of December 31, 2013 . The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels. In September 1999, we issued Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $828 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2013 . Each ZENS note was originally exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS note are adjusted for certain corporate events. As of December 31, 2013 , the reference shares for each ZENS note consisted of 0.5 share of TW Common, 0.125505 share of Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) common stock (TWC Common) and 0.045455 share of AOL Inc. common stock (AOL Common). On February 13, 2014, TWC announced that it had agreed to merge with Comcast Corporation (Comcast). In the merger, each share of TWC Common would be exchanged for 2.875 shares of Comcast common stock (Comcast Common). Upon the closing of the merger (assuming no change in the merger consideration), the reference shares for each ZENS note would include 0.360827 share of Comcast Common in place of the current 0.125505 share of TWC Common. If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals 61 related to the ZENS notes and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares would typically cease when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes. If all ZENS notes had been exchanged for cash on December 31, 2013 , deferred taxes of approximately $364 million would have been payable in 2013. Cross Defaults Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $75 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. In addition, three outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $750 million in principal amount as of December 31, 2013 , provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or revolving credit facilities. Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures From time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. Enable Midstream Partners In connection with its formation on May 1, 2013, Enable (i) entered into a $1.05 billion 3-year senior unsecured term loan facility, (ii) repaid $1.05 billion of indebtedness owed to CERC Corp., and (iii) entered into a $1.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Enable's $1.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility backstops its $1.4 billion commercial paper program. As of January 31, 2014, Enable had no outstanding commercial paper and $318 million borrowed under its revolving credit facility. Any reduction in Enable credit ratings could prevent it from accessing the commercial paper markets. The sponsors of Enable, including us, may from time to time provide funds to Enable through loans and/or capital contributions in addition to funds that Enable may obtain from time to time under its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program or from other sources, which loans or capital contributions could be substantial. Certain of the entities contributed to Enable by CERC Corp. are obligated on approximately $363 million of indebtedness owed to a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. that is scheduled to mature in 2017. Prior to an initial public offering of Enable, Enable is obligated to distribute 100% of its distributable cash (as such term is defined in its partnership agreement) to its limited partners each fiscal quarter within 45 days following the end of the applicable quarter. In July 2013, CERC Corp. received a cash distribution of approximately $36 million from Enable made with respect to CERC Corp. limited partner interest in Enable for the months of May and June 2013 (the two months in the second quarter following the formation of Enable on May 1, 2013). In November 2013, CERC Corp. received a cash distribution of approximately $70 million from Enable made with respect to CERC Corp. limited partner interest in Enable for the third quarter of 2013. CERC Corp. received a cash distribution of approximately $67 million from Enable in February 2014 made with respect to CERC Corp. limited partner interest in Enable for the fourth quarter of 2013. Under the terms of an omnibus agreement entered into in connection with the formation of Enable, CenterPoint Energy and OGE Energy are obligated to indemnify Enable for specified breaches of representations and warranties in the master formation agreement pursuant to which Enable was formed related to: (i) their respective authority to enter into the transactions that formed Enable and the capitalization of the entities contributed to Enable; (ii) permits related to the operation of the assets contributed to Enable; (iii) compliance with environmental laws; (iv) title to properties and rights of way; (v) the tax classification of the entities contributed to Enable; (vi) indemnified taxes; and (vii) events and conditions associated with CenterPoint Energy and OGE respective ownership and operation of the assets contributed to Enable. Pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement, each of CenterPoint Energy and OGE respective maximum liability for this indemnification obligation with respect to permit, environmental and title representations will not exceed $250 million, and neither OGE Energy nor CenterPoint 62 Energy will have any obligation under this indemnification until Enable aggregate indemnifiable losses exceed $25 million, respectively. CenterPoint Energy and OGE Energy indemnification obligations under the omnibus agreement will survive (i) for permit matters until May 1, 2014, (ii) for environmental and title and rights of way matters until May 1, 2016 and (iii) for tax classification matters and indemnified taxes until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Indemnification obligations for authority and capitalization matters survive indefinitely. Dodd-Frank Swaps Regulation We use derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices and weather on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk. Following enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in July 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has promulgated regulations to implement Dodd-Frank changes to the Commodity Exchange Act, including the definition of commodity-based swaps subject to those regulations. The CFTC regulations are intended to implement new reporting and record keeping requirements related to their swap transactions and a mandatory clearing and exchange-execution regime for various types, categories or classes of swaps, subject to certain exemptions, including the trade-option and end-user exemptions. Although we anticipate that most, if not all, of our swap transactions should qualify for an exemption to the clearing and exchange-execution requirements, we will still be subject to record keeping and reporting requirements. Other changes to the Commodity Exchange Act made as a result of Dodd-Frank and the CFTC implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps. Collection of Receivables from REPs CenterPoint Houston receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston services or could cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston cash flows. In the event of a REP default, CenterPoint Houston tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option of CenterPoint Houston to request that the Texas Utility Commission suspend or revoke the certification of the REP. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. However, CenterPoint Houston remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the replacement REP or the provider of last resort. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made against CenterPoint Houston involving payments it had received from such REP. If a REP were to file for bankruptcy, CenterPoint Houston may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such REP that are unpaid as of the date the REP filed for bankruptcy. However, Texas Utility Commission regulations authorize utilities, such as CEHE, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including our weather hedging arrangements, and gas purchases, gas price and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services business segments; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various legislative or regulatory actions; incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; 63 the ability of GenOn and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of GenOn indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money CenterPoint Houston revolving credit facility limits CenterPoint Houston consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of its consolidated capitalization. CERC Corp. revolving credit facility limits CERC consolidated debt to an amount not to exceed 65% of its consolidated capitalization. Our revolving credit facility limits our consolidated debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to an amount not to exceed 65% of our consolidated capitalization. The financial covenant limit in our revolving credit facility will temporarily increase from 65% to 70% if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. Accounting for Rate Regulation Accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment and our Natural Gas Distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2013 , we had recorded regulatory assets of $3.7 billion and regulatory liabilities of $1.2 billion. 64 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Identifiable Intangibles, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. A loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary. Unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill and equity method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge. We recorded goodwill impairment of $-0-, $252 million and $-0- during 2013, 2012 and 2011. We did not record material impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles, or equity method investments during 2013, 2012, and 2011. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2013 and determined, based on the results of the first step, using the income approach, no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit. Our reporting units approximate our reportable segments. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. The determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forward-looking in nature. To assist in making these assumptions, we utilized a third-party valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units. We based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from those projections. These projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives, and for our Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit, the regulatory environment. The fair value of our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services reporting units exceeded the carrying value by approximately $2.3 billion and $259 million, respectively, or approximately 80% and 50%, excess fair value over the carrying values for each reporting unit, respectively. A key assumption in the income approach was the weighted average cost of capital of 5.1% and 6.0% applied in the valuation for Natural Gas Distributions and Energy Services, respectively. Although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2013 annual test, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time. No impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2013 annual test. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through AMS meter communications or manual readings. At the end of each month, deliveries to non-AMS customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Information regarding deliveries to AMS customers after the last billing is obtained from actual AMS meter usage data. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual AMS meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. 65 Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read Other Significant Matters Pension Plans for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 6(b) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA. The minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were $83 million, $73 million and $35 million for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. We made contributions of $83 million, $73 million and $65 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 for the respective years. We expect to make contributions aggregating approximately $87 million in 2014 . Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $8 million, $9 million and $10 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. As the sponsor of a plan, we are required to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan's over-funded status or as a liability such plan's under-funded status, (b) measure a plan's assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets. As of December 31, 2013 , the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $350 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2014 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension cost was $72 million, $82 million and $78 million for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, of which $64 million, $67 million and $49 million impacted pre-tax earnings. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2013 , our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00%, which is a 1.00% decrease from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2012 due to the increase in the allocation to fixed income investments in our targeted asset allocation. The expected rate of return assumption was developed by a weighted-average return analysis of the targeted asset allocation for CenterPoint Energy plans and the expected real return for each asset class, based on the long- 66 term capital market assumptions, adjusted for investment fees and diversification effects, in addition to expected inflation. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2013 , the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 4.80%, which is a 0.80% increase from the 4.00% discount rate assumed in 2012 . The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension cost for 2014 , including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $71 million, of which we expect $63 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% and a discount rate of 4.80% as of December 31, 2013 . If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 7.00% to 6.50%, 2014 pension cost would increase by approximately $9 million. As of December 31, 2013 , the pension plan projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded benefit restoration plan, exceeded plan assets by $350 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 4.80% to 4.30%, the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2014 pension expense by approximately $103 million and $5 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2013 by $84 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2013 of $12 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.
