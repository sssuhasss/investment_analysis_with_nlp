Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report. Executive Overview World oil markets remained tightly balanced for much of 2006 as demand, geopolitical events and inherent production decline continued to pressure the margin of excess production capacity. The price for WTI (West Texas Intermediate) reached a record of $78-per-barrel in mid-July but then began a fall that continued through the end of year as increasing stockpiles indicated adequate supply. Although prices recovered as OPEC cut production targets from November 1 st , mild weather conditions in the Northern Hemisphere further exacerbated the balance of supply and demand and prices ended the year around the $55-per-barrel mark. However, at this level there were no signs of reductions in customer activity in any of the major oil-producing regions around the world. Natural gas displayed similar characteristics with the price falling considerably in the fourth quarter of 2006 as the high quantity in storage in North America appeared more than ample for what had begun as a predominantly mild winter. By the end of 2006, this demand environment had lead to activity reduction in Canada, particularly in areas of shallow natural gas and coalbed methane production. Short-term variations in commodity prices inevitably produce varying activity growth rates in the underlying industries when the price variations are sufficiently long-lasting. However, maintaining the production base for both oil and natural gas in the face of accelerating decline rates, poorer quality or more difficult reservoirs and eroding reserve replacement ratios we believe will mean that any moderation in customer activity resulting from price variation will be short-lived and self-correcting. While Schlumberger remains of the opinion that there is no overall shortage of oil and gas reserves worldwide, we believe the world is realizing that the period of cheap hydrocarbon energy has ended and new and higher sustained levels of investment are necessary to meet demand and guarantee future supplies. Within this context, the performance of the two Schlumberger business segments, Oilfield Services and WesternGeco, has been particularly strong. Consolidated revenues in 2006 grew by 34%, far exceeding original expectations driven by significant price increases, a rich portfolio of new Schlumberger technologies, and by stronger activity in almost all GeoMarkets. The same combination led to significant margin growth for both Schlumberger business segments with WesternGeco growth during the year being particularly impressive as exploration activity resurged. The last two years have seen a significant shift in the dynamics of access to reserves. This has been the case in Latin America and in Russia, and is also the case in the Middle East. In addition, and in a way not seen since the 1973 oil shocks, access to reserves has become an issue of national energy security, particularly for the growing economies of Asia. As a result, many national oil companies have begun to expand beyond their geographic borders, and are therefore competing for access to reserves against the international industry. The same lack of access has driven the international oil companies to smaller, more complex and more remote areas where substantial investment is required. The period from 2000 to 2004 reflected a lack of exploration-related activity as a whole. This can now clearly be seen as changing, and we believe that industry spending will increase for a number of years to come. Regions that are emerging include many areas in West and South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, India and China, and the GeoMarkets that cover these regions all contributed to Schlumberger growth in 2006. However, what is perhaps equally significant is the increase in exploration within known fields. This is driven by the need to identify and access by-passed or small accumulations of oil that can be tied back to existing infrastructure. The North Sea, parts of Saudi Arabia and Russia are examples of this. 15 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 In Russia, and more particularly in West Siberia, the production enhancement activity that restored production in the 1998-2003 timeframe is now becoming a business focused on developing the remaining pockets of recoverable oil within producing reservoirs. At the same time, continuing exploration activity offshore Sakhalin, and burgeoning exploration in Eastern Siberia are contributing to rapid growth. Growth has been fueled both by organic expansion and by the acquisition of PetroAlliance Services, which was completed in May 2006. To supply the Russian market, we have continued to increase our in-country product development and manufacturing with installations in Tyumen and Novosibirsk in Western Siberia. The resurgence in exploration activity has led to substantial technology-based growth for Schlumberger. WesternGeco, as well as Oilfield Services Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing services have all benefited from this as they are services that impact reservoir characterization and understanding. Growth, however, has been accelerated by a number of critical acquisitions. In addition to the last tranche of PetroAlliance Services in Russia, Schlumberger purchased the 30% minority interest in WesternGeco in the second quarter of 2006. This acquisition has removed the barriers to integration of a number of different measurement techniques that was not possible in a joint venture with a competitor. But perhaps even more significantly, Schlumberger made other acquisitions to extend its technology portfolio. Odegaard inversion software, TerraTek geomechanical expertise and Reslink advanced completions solutions were three such examples in 2006. Integrated Project Management has been a further avenue for growth that has responded to an emerging customer need in markets where the lack of skilled resources and the increase in international operations have posed challenges for a variety of industry operators. In 2005 and 2006 Schlumberger has focused on this market opportunity that responds to the need to increase production and reserves. Clear focus on bringing field and production management services as well as well construction services have had positive effects on returns and 2006 profitability has shown a marked improvement over prior years. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements . (Stated in millions) 2006 2005 % Change 2005 2004 % Change OILFIELD SERVICES Operating Revenue $ 16,767 $ 12,648 33 % $ 12,648 $ 10,239 24 % Pretax Segment Income $ 4,603 $ 2,805 64 % $ 2,805 $ 1,801 56 % WESTERNGECO Operating Revenue $ 2,471 $ 1,662 49 % $ 1,662 $ 1,238 34 % Pretax Segment Income $ 853 $ 317 170 % $ 317 $ 124 155 % Pretax segment income represents the business segments income before taxes and minority interest. Pretax segment income excludes corporate expenses, interest income, interest expense, amortization of certain intangibles, interest, stock-based compensation costs and the Charges and Credits described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as these items are not allocated to the segments. Oilfield Services 2006 Results Revenue of $16.77 billion increased 33% in 2006 versus 2005 driven by growth in oilfield services activities as operators responded strongly to increasing global hydrocarbon demand through renewed exploration and increased focus on production operations. Within the geographic Areas, North America revenue increased 40%, Europe/CIS/Africa increased 36%, Middle East & Asia increased 31% and Latin America increased 16%. Pretax operating income of $4.60 billion in 2006 grew by 64% over 2005 resulting in operating margins climbing by 527 basis points (bps) to reach a new record of 27.5%. Stronger activity, accelerating higher-margin new technology deployment and increased pricing across all Areas were the principal contributors to this performance. 16 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Among the GeoMarkets, the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in US Land, followed by the Arabian, Russian, North Sea, US Gulf Coast, Canada, West & South Africa, Nigeria and North Africa GeoMarkets. The growth in Russia was driven by a combination of activity within the established GeoMarkets and the impact of the acquisition of PetroAlliance Services. Significant demand was seen for all Technologies as customers sought to improve exploration and production performance while mitigating technical risk in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields. A number of key acquisitions were made during the year. These included the acquisition of the outstanding 49% of PetroAlliance Services in Russia; as well as TerraTek a global leader in geomechanics measurements and analysis; Odegaard a leader in advanced surface seismic data inversion software; and Reslink a leading supplier of advanced completion solutions which offer a broad spectrum of engineering applications and products for sand management, zonal isolation and intelligent well completions. North America Revenue of $5.27 billion increased 40% over 2005 mainly driven by the US Land and US Gulf Coast GeoMarkets, which benefited from strong Well Services, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline activities coupled with continued pricing improvements. Increasing demand for Well Testing activities offshore also contributed to growth. Sharply increased activity in the US Land GeoMarket led to strong equipment and personnel utilization, higher pricing and increased demand for high-tier, new-technology services. The US Gulf Coast GeoMarket rebounded strongly from the effects of the disastrous 2005 hurricane season with growth driven by a combination of new exploration and increased production-related activities. Canada continued to grow due to strong demand for Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies. Growth was somewhat offset by lower Well Services activity in the coal bed methane and shallow gas areas in the second half of the year. Pretax operating income of $1.60 billion was 72% higher than in 2005 led by the US Land and US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarkets. The steep growth was primarily due to continuing strength in pricing, particularly for Well Services, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies, and a more favorable activity mix resulting from the deployment of higher-margin new-technology Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well Testing services. Latin America Revenue of $2.56 billion in 2006 increased 16% over 2005 led by the Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket, followed by the Latin America South and Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarkets. Growth in the Area was impacted by budget-related activity slowdowns in Mexico together with geopolitical concerns in other parts of the region. The Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket recorded strong growth due to solid demand for Drilling & Measurements technologies. Well Services, Wireline, Completions and Artificial Lift technologies also contributed to growth. In Venezuela, discussions regarding new contracts for the drilling barges work and the settlement of certain outstanding receivables had progressed at the end of the year. Pending finalization of these new contracts, revenue recognition was deferred on certain work performed in the third and fourth quarters. As the costs associated with this work were also deferred, this did not have a significant impact on the Area pretax operating income. The Latin America South GeoMarket registered strong growth due primarily to increased Well Services, Drilling & Measurements, IPM and Well Testing activities, while growth in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket resulted from significant demand for Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Artificial Lift technologies. 17 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Pretax operating income of $495 million in 2006 increased 50% versus 2005. This increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix in IPM projects and improved operating efficiencies in Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing services. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $4.82 billion in 2006 increased 36% over 2005 with the highest growth recorded in the North Sea, North Africa, Nigeria GeoMarkets and in Russia. Strong revenue increases were recorded in Russia and other CIS countries despite the weather-related slowdown in the first quarter, due to a combination of organic growth within Schlumberger Technology lines and the impact of the acquisition of PetroAlliance Services. Renewed customer focus on exploration resulted in steep growth in the North Sea and North Africa GeoMarkets, while the West & South Africa and Nigeria GeoMarkets maintained a robust growth momentum. Pretax operating income of $1.20 billion in 2006 increased 70% compared to 2005. All GeoMarkets contributed significantly through increased activity, improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment. Middle East & Asia Revenue of $3.96 billion in 2006 increased 31% over 2005 with the largest increases recorded in the Arabian, East Africa & East Mediterranean and Gulf GeoMarkets. Saudi Arabia continued aggressive growth rates as activity increased rapidly, distinguishing the Arabian GeoMarket as the fastest growing of all of the GeoMarkets. Growth in the East Africa & East Mediterranean and Gulf GeoMarkets was principally attributed to higher activity in Drilling & Measurements and Wireline services. The Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, Australia Papua New Guinea and Thailand/Vietnam/Myanmar GeoMarkets also contributed to growth. All Technologies witnessed solid growth as activity increased and demand for new technology increased with significant progress in the deployment of Drilling & Measurements PowerDrive* and Scope* technologies to enable successful drilling of a number of complex borehole trajectories. Pretax operating income of $1.29 billion in 2006 increased 48% compared to 2005. The steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all GeoMarkets, significant price increases and accelerated new technology deployment. WesternGeco 2006 Results Operating revenue of $2.47 billion increased 49% in 2006 versus 2005. This strong performance was due to the continued market acceptance of Q-Technology* services and strong performance from Marine, Land, Data Processing and Multiclient services. During the second quarter, Schlumberger acquired the Baker Hughes 30% interest in WesternGeco. Revenue backlog reached $1.1 billion at the end of 2006 compared to $790 million at the end of last year, reflecting increasing exploration and production activity. Q-Technology revenues reached $726 million in 2006, representing 29% of total revenue in 2006, significantly in excess of the $399 million achieved in 2005. Utilization of the six Q-equipped vessels reached 100% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Multiclient sales increased 51% to $770 million, mainly in the US Gulf of Mexico due to strong sales of the world largest and most complex depth migration project known as E-Dog which covers an area of 20,250 sq km and extends over 800 blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Also contributing to the strong increase were higher sales in Latin America, Asia and West Africa reflecting the strengthening exploration activity. Marine revenue grew 65% due mainly to strong activity in Asia, Middle East, India, Europe and North America. Higher vessel utilization, accelerated adoption of Q-Technology and increasing prices contributed to this performance. 18 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Land revenue increased 28% driven by higher sales of Q-Land*, strong activity in the Middle East and South America, and a steep growth in North Africa. The Land seismic crew count increased from 24 at the end of 2005 to 30 at the end of 2006, of which five crews were equipped with Q-Land technology. Data Processing revenue increased 22%, reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q processing, and higher activity in India, Asia, North Africa, Europe and the Caspian. During the year, WesternGeco opened a new data processing and reservoir services center in Mumbai, India. The new center, staffed with more than 40 geologists and geophysicists, is one of the most powerful WesternGeco computing facilities worldwide. The center is equipped to provide customers with a full suite of advanced data processing services, including depth imaging and reservoir seismic services such as reservoir characterization and 4D (time-lapse) processing and analysis. Pretax operating income reached $853 million in 2006 compared to $317 million in 2005 due to accelerating demand for Q* technology coupled with improved pricing and increased vessel utilization, together with strong Multiclient sales. Increased demand for Q-Marine* services led to the commissioning of the sixth Q-Technology equipped vessel the Western Monarch during the second quarter. In addition, and in response to further demand, WesternGeco announced the launch of the seventh, eighth and ninth Q vessels in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Oilfield Services 2005 Results Revenue of $12.65 billion increased 24% in 2005 versus 2004. Both Latin America and Europe/CIS/Africa increased 27%, Middle East & Asia increased 22% and North America increased 21%. The strong activity levels around the world reflected the growing response to the current narrow margin of excess production capacity. Pretax operating income of $2.81 billion in 2005 was 56% higher than in 2004 demonstrating high demand for oilfield services and accelerating technology delivery. Both higher activity and stronger pricing contributed to the sharp increase in pretax operating margins that strengthened across all Oilfield Services geographic areas. Pricing showed strong improvement in North America and continued to make excellent progress internationally. Customer concern over the availability of certain services and products coupled with recognition of elements of cost inflation has led to inclusion of price-escalation clauses in longer-term contracts. Activity increased universally, with the largest growth recorded in the GeoMarkets in Canada; US Land; Peru/Colombia/Ecuador; Russia; Nigeria; Australasia; Saudi Arabia; and the Arabian Gulf. Both organic growth and acquisitions contributed to the more than 50% revenue growth in Russia in 2005 versus 2004. Demand for all Technologies increased sharply, but particularly for Well Services and Well Completions & Productivity services. Technology introduction accelerated during the year. The Scope* family of Drilling & Measurements services for improved drilling performance and enhanced formation evaluation met growing acceptance as customers realized step changes in well-placement accuracy in several geographical areas. During 2005 Schlumberger also launched the Scanner Family* of wireline logging services, a revolutionary suite of downhole rock and fluid characterization measurements. North America Revenue of $3.76 billion increased 21% over 2004 mainly driven by Canada and US Land, which benefited from strong Well Services and Drilling & Measurements activity coupled with strong pricing improvements. The Canada GeoMarket experienced strong equipment and personnel utilization, higher pricing and increased demand for high-tier services. The robust growth in US Land resulted from the combination of positive trends in activity and favorable pricing. 19 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 During the third quarter, activity was severely disrupted in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 25 days of operating time lost due to the disastrous hurricane season. Damage sustained by production platforms and mobile offshore drilling units led to reduced activity throughout the third quarter with some lingering effect in the fourth quarter. Pretax operating income of $933 million was 80% higher than in 2004 led by US Land and Canada. The steep growth was primarily due to double-digit price increases, particularly for Well Services, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies. New technology introduction and continuing activity growth also contributed to these results. The severe hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 had an estimated impact of approximately $70 million in lost revenue, and $52 million in lost pretax operating income. Latin America Revenue of $2.21 billion in 2005 increased 27% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Latin America South GeoMarkets. Mexico recorded significant revenue growth, mainly due to a high number of wells being completed on the Burgos project, coupled with an overall rise in third-party managed services revenue. Activity in Venezuela increased primarily from IPM and Well Services operations. During the year, continued progress was highlighted with the signing of a short-term renewable agreement with PDVSA in early 2005 relating to the drilling barges work. Discussions regarding the settlement of certain outstanding receivables were still ongoing at year-end. The Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket contributed significantly to the revenue growth due to the start of several new Drilling & Measurements contracts for the expanding customer base. The growth in the Latin America South GeoMarket was primarily driven by increased IPM activity, although Brazil experienced strong activity from the deployment of Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies. Pretax operating income of $330 million in 2005 increased 49% versus 2004. This strong increase in operating income resulted mainly from an improved drilling environment in Venezuela coupled with stronger operating efficiencies in Well Services and Drilling & Measurements services and across all GeoMarkets, particularly in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket. Europe/CIS/Africa Revenue of $3.53 billion in 2005 increased 27% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Russia and Nigeria GeoMarkets. Strong revenue increases were recorded offshore Nigeria and in deepwater West Africa GeoMarket operations mainly benefiting Well Completions & Productivity, Wireline, and Drilling & Measurements with the rapid market acceptance of Scope technology. The CIS reached revenue of $1.17 billion, an increase of 42% over 2004. The significant increase in revenue in Russia was due to a combination of organic growth, and the impact of the acquisitions of PetroAlliance and the Siberian Geophysical Company. Organic growth in Russia was driven by a recovery in activity for Yuganskneftegaz during the first quarter, increased demand for stimulation and cementing services, strengthening of IPM operations, and robust uptake of new technology. Pretax operating income of $704 million in 2005 increased 57% compared to 2004. Nigeria and West Africa contributed significantly due to increased activity, pricing improvements, and accelerated technology deployment. Operating income in the North Africa GeoMarket also increased markedly due to the growing presence of international oil companies in the region. The North Sea GeoMarket was a strong contributor to operating income through increased drilling activity and strong demand for production technologies from Well Services and Wireline. 20 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Middle East & Asia Revenue of $3.03 billion in 2005 increased 22% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Australasia, Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Gulf GeoMarkets. The importance of the Middle East in responding to the current lack of spare production capacity is reflected in the strong activity plans that were implemented in the region in 2005. The marked revenue growth seen in the Saudi Arabia GeoMarket was principally due to the increase in rig count as Saudi Aramco continued to increase activity in line with its announced spending plans. East Africa & East Mediterranean GeoMarket growth was mainly due to the expanded market for Drilling & Measurements and the start of a new Wireline campaign. In the Gulf GeoMarket, the start-up of Wireline services for Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and burgeoning gas activity in Qatar also contributed to the revenue growth. The Arabian, the Gulf and East Africa & East Mediterranean GeoMarkets recorded revenue increases of more than 30% and operating income growth of more than 40%. The solid contribution from the Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines GeoMarket was mainly due to higher customer expenditures, improved pricing, and a move by several operators into increased deepwater exploration uniquely benefiting Schlumberger technologies. Activity in China strengthened throughout the year as a result of accelerated adoption of advanced Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies. Australasia experienced a robust revenue growth rate mainly due to rising development activity in offshore Australia combined with growing land-based activity in New Zealand. Pretax operating income of $871 million in 2005 increased 34% compared to 2004. The steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all GeoMarkets and significant price increases principally in Drilling & Measurements, Well Completions & Productivity, and Wireline Technologies coupled with the start-up of new projects throughout the Area. Improved results of the Bokor integrated project in the Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines GeoMarket also contributed to the operating income growth. WesternGeco 2005 Results Operating revenue for 2005 was $1.66 billion versus $1.24 billion in 2004. This strong performance was mainly attributable to the continued market acceptance of Q-Technology*, a higher level of Multiclient sales and improved operating leverage in Marine acquisition. Backlog reached $790 million at the end of 2005 compared to $670 million at the end of last year, reflecting increasing exploration and production budgets for 2006. Q-Technology revenues reached $399 million in 2005, representing 24% of total revenue in 2005, more than doubling the $162 million achieved in 2004. Utilization of the five Q-equipped vessels reached 93% in the fourth quarter of 2005. Q-Technology revenue is expected to grow by another 80% in 2006. Multiclient sales increased 17% to $509 million, mainly in North America due to an especially strong Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale, higher sales in Asia, the Caspian, South America and West Africa reflecting an improved exploration-spending environment. Approximately 64% of the multiclient surveys sold in 2005 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs, compared to approximately 52% in 2004 and only 7.7% of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in 2003 and 2002. Marine activity grew 63% mainly from strong activity in the North Sea, Asia, India and the Gulf of Mexico, combined with higher vessel utilization, steady price increases and more favorable contractual terms regarding risk sharing with customers for downtime. Land activity increased 31% mainly in the Middle East reflecting higher activity in Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Kuwait. The Land seismic crew count increased from 18 at the end of 2004 to 24 at the end of 2005. 21 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Data Processing increased 14% reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q-processing, and higher activity in South America and Russia. Pretax operating income reached $317 million in 2005 compared to $124 million in 2004 due to accelerating demand for Q-Marine* coupled with improved pricing and increased vessel utilization, together with strong Multiclient sales. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Interest income $ 117 $ 100 $ 56 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies 179 109 94 Gain on sale of facility in Montrouge, France 1 163 Gain on sale of Hanover Compressor investment 1 21 Loss on sale of Atos Origin shares 1 (21 ) Loss on liquidation of investments to fund the WesternGeco transaction 1 (9 ) Gains on sales of other assets 15 $ 287 $ 408 $ 129 1. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding these items. Interest Income The average return on investments increased to 4.5% in 2006 from 3.3% in 2005 and the weighted average investment balance of $2.6 billion in 2006 decreased $452 million compared to 2005. The average return on investments increased to 3.3% in 2005 from 2% in 2004 and the average investment balance of $3.0 billion in 2005 increased $297 million compared to 2004. Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies The equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents Schlumberger share of the results of its 40% interest in the M-I SWACO drilling fluids joint venture with Smith International Inc. Interest Expense Interest expense of $234.9 million in 2006 increased by $37.8 million compared to 2005. The weighted average borrowing rates of 4.6% increased in 2006 from 4.4% in 2005. The weighted average debt balance of $5.1 billion in 2006 increased by $609 million compared to 2005, primarily due to the funding of the WesternGeco transaction described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense in 2004 of $272 million included a net charge of $64 million related to the United States interest rate swaps (see Charges and Credits). Excluding this net charge, interest expense decreased $11 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a $865 million decrease in average debt balances partially offset by an increase in the weighted average borrowing rates from 3.9% to 4.4%. Other Gross margin was 31.3%, 25.6% and 21.1% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Charges and Credits noted on the following page adversely impacted the gross margin by 0.4% in 2004. Charges and Credits had an insignificant impact on the 2006 and 2005 gross margin. The increases in gross margins are primarily due to record activity levels in 2006 and 2005, increased pricing, stronger demand for higher-margin technologies, and operating efficiency improvements. 22 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 As a percentage of revenue, research & engineering, marketing and general & administrative expenses are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Research and engineering 3.2 %* 3.5 % 4.1 % Marketing 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.4 % General and administrative 2.2 % 2.4 % 2.8 % * Includes $27 million of in-process research and development charges. 1 Research and engineering expenditures, by segment, were as follows: (Stated in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Oilfield Services $ 504 $ 451 $ 416 WesternGeco 65 51 48 In-process R&D charges 1 27 Other 2 23 4 3 $ 619 $ 506 $ 467 1. See discussion of Charges and Credits in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 2. Includes $16 million of cost in 2006 associated with Schlumberger relocation of its United States research center from Ridgefield to Boston. Income Taxes The reported effective tax rate, including Charges and Credits , was 24.0% in 2006, 22.9% in 2005 and 20.9% in 2004. The Charges and Credits noted below decreased the effective rate by 1.5% in 2005 and increased the effective tax rate by 0.4% in 2004. The impact of Charges and Credits on the effective tax rate in 2006 was not significant. The effective tax rate in 2005 reflects the impact of the $163 million gain on the sale of the Montrouge facility. This transaction allowed for the utilization of a deferred tax asset that was previously offset by a valuation allowance and had the effect of lowering the effective tax rate during 2005 by 1.3%. Excluding the impact of this transaction, the effective tax rate was relatively flat in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in the reported effective tax from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the country mix of results in Oilfield Services, which experienced a higher proportion of pretax profitability in higher-tax jurisdictions in 2005. This increase was somewhat mitigated by the impact of the $163 million gain on the sale of the Montrouge facility. This transaction, as described above, had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate in 2005. Charges and Credits During each of 2006, 2005 and 2004, Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

These divestitures, which were accounted for as Discontinued Operations , are more fully described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . As a result of these transactions, Schlumberger generated cash, including proceeds from the sale of securities received, of approximately $28 million in 2005 and $2.93 billion in 2004. These proceeds were primarily used to further Schlumberger deleveraging efforts. The following table summarizes the results of these discontinued operations: (Stated in millions) 2005 2004 Revenues $ 8 $ 590 Income (loss) before taxes $ (1 ) $ 55 Tax expense 16 Gains on disposal, net of tax 9 171 Income from discontinued operations $ 8 $ 210 Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based compensation expense was $114 million in 2006 compared to $40 million in 2005. This increase is principally attributable to the following: (i) the adoption of FAS 123R, as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , which requires companies to expense the unamortized portion of stock options granted prior to 2003 when Schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, (ii) 2006 was the first year that the full 4-year impact of the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 (adopted by Schlumberger in January 2003) was reflected in Schlumberger results and (iii) valuations of 2006 stock-based compensation awards increased due to the upward movement in Schlumberger stock price as compared to prior years. 24 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Stock-based compensation expense is currently estimated to be approximately $150 million in 2007. This represents an increase of approximately $36 million as compared to 2006 and is primarily attributable to (i) the fact that Schlumberger began granting restricted stock in 2006 to a targeted population of employees in order to promote retention and this practice is expected to continue in future years and (ii) the impact of increased valuations of stock-based compensation awards due to the upward movement in Schlumberger stock price as compared to prior years. During 2006, Schlumberger relocated its United States corporate office from New York to Houston and its United States research center from Ridgefield to Boston. Schlumberger incurred approximately $30 million of incremental expenses in connection with these moves in 2006. The vast majority of these costs were incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 ($10 million in the third quarter; $15 million in the fourth quarter). Cash Flow Net Debt is gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt, and that the level of net debt provides useful information as to the results of Schlumberger deleveraging efforts. Details of the change in Net Debt follows: (Stated in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net Debt, beginning of year $ (532 ) $ (1,459 ) $ (4,176 ) Income from continuing operations 3,710 2,199 1,014 Excess of equity income over dividends received (181 ) (86 ) (66 ) Charges and credits, net of tax & minority interest 43 (173 ) 199 Depreciation and amortization 1 1,561 1,351 1,308 Increase in working capital (351 ) (286 ) (502 ) US qualified pension and postretirement benefit contributions (225 ) (172 ) (254 ) Capital expenditures 1 (2,637 ) (1,652 ) (1,279 ) Proceeds from employee stock plans 442 345 278 Stock repurchase program (1,068 ) (612 ) (320 ) Dividends paid (568 ) (482 ) (441 ) Proceeds from business divestitures 22 1,729 Proceeds from the sale of the Montrouge facility 230 Sale of Hanover Compressor stock 110 Net debt acquired (50 ) Acquisiton of minority interest in WesternGeco (2,406 ) Other business acquisitions (577 ) (117 ) (43 ) Distribution to joint venture partner (60 ) (30 ) Sale of Axalto stock 99 Sale of Atos Origin stock 1,165 Debt extinguishment costs (111 ) Settlement of US interest rate swap (70 ) Translation effect on net debt (66 ) 94 (75 ) Discontinued operations 3 51 Other 81 233 35 Net Debt, end of year $ (2,834 ) $ (532 ) $ (1,459 ) 1.

Approximately 50% of the purchase price was funded from Schlumberger cash and investments. The remaining 50% was financed through existing Schlumberger credit facilities. In September 2006, Schlumberger Finance B.V. issued 400 million Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes due 2009. Interest is payable quarterly at the rate of 10 basis points over 3-month Euribor. Schlumberger entered into an agreement to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger Finance B.V. will pay interest in US dollars at the rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 0.0875%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. On July 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved a share buyback program of up to 30 million shares to be acquired in the open market before December 2006, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006. On April 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved another share buy-back program of up to 40 million shares to be acquired in the open market before April 2010, subject to market conditions, of which approximately 13.6 million shares have been repurchased as of December 31, 2006. The following table summarizes the activity under these share buy-back programs during 2006, 2005 and 2004: (Stated in thousands except per share amounts) Total cost of shares purchased Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share 2006 $ 1,067,842 17,992.7 $ 59.35 2005 $ 611,641 15,274.8 $ 40.04 2004 $ 320,224 10,296.4 $ 31.10 During 2006 and 2005, Schlumberger announced that the Board of Directors had approved increases in the quarterly dividend of 19% and 12%, respectively. On January 18, 2007, Schlumberger announced that the Board of Directors approved a 40% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.175 per share effective commencing with the dividend payable on April 6, 2007. Total dividends paid during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were approximately $568 million, $482 million and $441 million, respectively. In 2006, cash provided by operations was $4.8 billion as net income plus depreciation & amortization were partly offset by increases in customer receivables and inventories, due to higher activity levels. In 2006, cash used in investing activities was $5.1 billion and included investments in fixed assets ($2.5 billion), multiclient seismic data ($180 million), the acquisition of the minority interest in WesternGeco ($2.4 billion) and other business acquisitions ($584 million). These investments were partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of short-term investments ($701 million). 26 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 In 2006, cash provided by financing activities was $291 million which was primarily due to the proceeds from employee stock plans ($442 million) and an increase in debt of $1.5 billion partially offset by the repurchase of 17.99 million shares of Schlumberger stock ($1.07 billion) and the payment of dividends to shareholders ($568 million). Schlumberger believes that at December 31, 2006, cash and short-term investments of $3.0 billion and available and unused credit facilities of $2.2 billion are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding potential commitments associated with Schlumberger prior business acquisitions. Refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $227 million, $222 million and $347 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, except as described below under WesternGeco Purchase Accounting , under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-lined amortized value. 27 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. WesternGeco Purchase Accounting As described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , on April 28, 2006, Schlumberger acquired the 30% minority interest in WesternGeco from Baker Hughes Incorporated for $2.4 billion in cash. As a result of this transaction, Schlumberger owns 100% of WesternGeco. During the process of allocating the purchase price to the proportionate share of net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values, Schlumberger made certain significant estimates and assumptions relating to the accounting for WesternGeco vessels and multiclient seismic data. In analyzing the fair value of the WesternGeco vessels, it was determined that the remaining estimated useful lives of these assets exceeded the remaining estimated life currently being used to calculate depreciation expense. Therefore, the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels were extended an additional 4 years (on a weighted average basis) as of the date of the acquisition. The impact of the fair value adjustments for all fixed assets, combined with the change in estimate regarding the depreciable lives of the vessels, resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $2 million in 2006. The carrying value of the multiclient library immediately after the acquisition increased to $243 million from $202 million, reflecting the impact of a $41 million fair value adjustment. These capitalized costs will be charged to Cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs on the balance sheet to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. Schlumberger policy has been that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value. After consideration of the estimated number of future years that revenues are expected to be derived from the multiclient seismic data at the time of the acquisition, Schlumberger concluded that the remaining minimum amortization period should be 3 years for all surveys in the multiclient seismic library at the time of the transaction, effectively resetting the minimum amortization period. Therefore, the $243 million of capitalized multiclient seismic data costs will be charged to expense over a period no longer than the next 3 years from the date of the transaction. Surveys comprising the $202 million of multiclient seismic data costs prior to this transaction had a weighted average remaining life for purposes of computing the minimum amortization of approximately 1.8 years. Given the current emphasis on requiring multiclient projects to be significantly prefunded before the project commences, Schlumberger currently estimates that the majority of revenues to be derived from sales of new surveys will be achieved within a 4-year period. Therefore, Schlumberger will continue its policy that under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value for all surveys added to the library after the date of this transaction. The net impact of the $41 million fair value adjustment combined with the resetting of the minimum amortization period resulted in an approximate $28 million net reduction in multiclient amortization expense in 2006 as compared to what multiclient amortization expense would have been had this transaction not been consummated. 28 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices, customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. From time to time a third-party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. In order to estimate the fair value of a long-lived asset, Schlumberger may engage a third-party to assist with the valuation. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. Income Taxes Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that 29 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7 the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Contingencies The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for estimated future expenditures, relating to contractual obligations, associated with business divestitures that have been completed. It is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded. In the opinion of management, such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations. The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that Schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope of remediation, future technology, regulatory changes, natural resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the opinion of management, any such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The discount rate utilized to determine both the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans was increased from 5.75% at December 31, 2005 to 6.00% at December 31, 2006. The discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was reduced from 6.00% in 2005 to 5.75% in 2006. The change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation, are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.50% in both 2006 and 2005. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both 2006 and 2005 was 10% graded to 6% over the next four years and 5% thereafter. 30 Table of Contents Part II, Item 7,7A The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2006 Pretax Pension Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2006 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$7.1 +$65.7 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$7.0 - $63.6 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$3.9 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets -$3.9 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2006 Pretax Postretirement Medical Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2006 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$ 3.2 +$ 27.8 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $ 3.1 - $ 26.8 100 basis point decrease in medical cost trend rate - $ 17.7 - $ 99.2 100 basis point increase in medical cost trend rate +$ 21.8 +$121.8
