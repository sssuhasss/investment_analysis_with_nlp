ACQUISITION OF MACROMEDIA On December 3, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Macromedia for approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future, but we also anticipate cost saving synergies. We incurred restructuring charges of $19.7 million during fiscal 2006. Coinciding with the integration of Macromedia and the start of our 2006 fiscal year, we changed the reporting of our segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our various businesses. The discussions in this section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the financial statements contained herein, reflect the impact of the acquisition. See Note 2 for further information regarding this acquisition. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by high-end consumers, creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs; direct to end users; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-personal computer platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and 47 estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions, if any, must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenues could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. More or less product may be returned from what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations . Stock-based Compensation We adopted the provisions of, and account for stock-based compensation in accordance with, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We elected the modified-prospective method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. As permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 107, we estimate the 48 volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All share based payment awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares. Existing valuation models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock-based compensation. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock-based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination or forfeiture of those stock-based payments in the future. Certain stock-based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. There currently is no market-based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models, nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values. The guidance in SFAS 123R and SAB 107 is relatively new. The application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and assumptions. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the SFAS 123R disclosures. Goodwill Impairment We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if facts and circumstances warrant a review. We make judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. The timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of income in our current reporting period that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects the asset relates to, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the 49 value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax returns, primarily related to our intercompany transfer pricing. Although we believe our judgments, assumptions and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2006 During fiscal 2006, we continued to focus on delivering market-leading technologies and software that are redefining business, entertainment, and personal communications. Our solutions, which utilize industry standards for producing and delivering content that allow people to engage with information virtually anywhere at anytime, drove strong revenue and earnings growth in the year. In our Creative Solution segment, we generated strong year-over-year growth based on the addition of Macromedia products to our product portfolio and the performance of our Creative Suite products family. In addition, to capitalize on the broad adoption of digital video on the Web, we introduced Production Studio 1.0 - a suite of video products - including Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0, Adobe After Effects 7.0, Adobe Audition 2.0, and Adobe Encore 2.0. This new release drove strong year-over-year growth in the digital video category of our creative business. 50 In the fourth quarter, we introduced new versions of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements hobbyist products, which target consumers who desire professional-like capabilities with an easy-to-use interface for enhancing and sharing their memories in the form of images and video. These products contributed strong year-over-year growth in this category of our Creative Solutions segment. In our Knowledge Worker segment, we introduced Adobe Acrobat 3D 7.0 in the first quarter to address the needs of the engineering and manufacturing markets, where complex documents are created and shared across diverse user bases and platforms. In addition, we delivered the Acrobat 8 family of products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Acrobat 8 has numerous new features to help drive increased adoption by users in enterprises, governments and specialized vertical markets such as architecture, engineering and construction. In combination with the delivery of Acrobat 8, we introduced Acrobat Connect, a rebranded and new version of the former Macromedia Breeze product, which provides real-time collaboration via the Web. Together, these product introductions and our execution against the opportunities we forecast in the knowledge worker business helped us to achieve strong year-over-year growth in this business. Our Enterprise and Developer segment also achieved solid results in 2006, generating record revenue and gaining broad market acceptance in the categories of Document Services and Rich Internet Applications with our LiveCycle and Flex technologies. In our Other segments, we achieved solid growth through the monetization of our platform technologies, as well as new releases of existing products such as Adobe Captivate 2 and Adobe Contribute 4 (which were former Macromedia products). Our Postscript printing technology, a key part of our Other segments revenue, also generated year-over-year growth.

We did not have platform revenue in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2006 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. We had an approximately 45% increase in revenue from our Digital Video software products due to the release of the Adobe Production Studio and the new versions of our video products. Revenue also increased 9% in our creative products due to continued growth in revenue from our Adobe Creative Suite product and the introduction of new software bundles. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues of 2% from our Digital Imaging software products due to product lifecycle timing and the success of our suites and bundles. Revenue from our Knowledge Worker Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared fiscal 2005 primarily due to continued adoption of our Acrobat family of products and the launch of 52 Acrobat 8 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, as well as the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Enterprise and Developer Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. Revenue from this segment also grew due to increases in revenue from our LiveCycle products of 23% as a result of increased licensing and server support revenue, as we continue to successfully focus on both the government sector and financial services. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Mobile and Device Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared fiscal 2005, wholly due to the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia.

There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment grew during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The growth in the segment was due to a 32% increase in revenues from the new versions of our Adobe Creative Suite products which were released during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Additionally, there was a 3% increase in revenues from our digital imaging software products as a result of new releases of our Adobe Photoshop Elements product as well as the new software bundle that combines our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Knowledge Worker segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 36% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products. The increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products is due to continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products by enterprises and technical professionals, as well as the release of Acrobat 7 during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Enterprise Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to our LiveCycle products. There was approximately a 10% increase in revenue during fiscal 2005 due to increased licensing and server support revenue, as we continued our focus on both the government sector and financial services. Additionally, revenue from our Enterprise Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2005 due to an increase in consulting revenues. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Other segments decreased slightly during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our Classic Publishing software products. Geographic Information Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Americas $ 1,266.7 35 % $ 939.7 22 % $ 770.6 Percentage of total revenues 49 % 48 % 46 % EMEA 770.1 26 % 612.7 13 % 541.5 Percentage of total revenues 30 % 31 % 33 % Asia 538.5 30 % 413.9 17 % 354.5 Percentage of total revenues 21 % 21 % 21 % Total revenues $ 2,575.3 31 % $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 53 Fiscal 2006 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue by Geography Overall revenues in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2006 increased comparatively to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the acquisition of Macromedia. Revenue in the Americas and EMEA increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker Solutions and Other segments. Revenue in Asia increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, Mobile and Device Solutions, and Other segments. Additionally, due to the weakening of the euro and the yen, revenues in EMEA and Asia measured in U.S. dollars were lower by approximately $13.8 million and $21.2 million, respectively in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenue by Geography Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments. Revenue in EMEA and Asia increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments. Additionally, due to the strength of the euro and the yen, revenues in EMEA and Asia measured in U.S. dollars were higher by approximately $15.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Inventory Information At the end of fiscal 2006 our overall channel inventory position was within our global inventory policy which allows up to an estimated 4.5 weeks of anticipated total product supply at our distributors. With regard to our product backlog, our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. For example, prior to the finalization and release of new products, we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases. Our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal 2006, other than those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global distributor inventory policy, was approximately 2% of fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenue. The comparable backlog at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2006 was an insignificant percentage of third quarter fiscal 2006 revenue. Cost of Revenues Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Product $ 226.5 152 % $ 90.0 4 % $ 86.6 Percentage of total revenues 9 % 5 % 5 % Services and support 66.0 192 % 22.6 27 % 17.8 Percentage of total revenues 3 % 1 % 1 % Total cost of revenues $ 292.5 160 % $ 112.6 8 % $ 104.4 54 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue fluctuated primarily due to the acquisition of Macromedia in the following areas: % Change 2006 to 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Increased (decreased) amortization of purchased technology 151 % (8 )% Increased cost of sales due to shrink-wrap revenue 3 5 Decreased localization costs related to our product launches (3 ) Increased royalties for licensed technologies 1 2 (Decreased) increased excess and obsolete inventory (2 ) 1 Increased localization costs related to our product launches 3 Various individually insignificant items 2 1 Total change 152 % 4 % Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee-related costs and related costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, due to compensation and related benefits and travel expenses as a result of higher headcount related to increases in services and support activities. Included in compensation costs for fiscal 2006 are compensation and related benefits, including amortization of deferred compensation, for former Macromedia employees and stock-based compensation costs as a result of adopting SFAS 123R at the beginning of fiscal 2006. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impact of SFAS 123R. Cost of services and support revenue also increased due to costs associated with our Expert Support program. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to increases in headcount related expenses, including higher compensation and related benefits, as well as outsourced consulting fees.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, pursuant to Board of Directors approval, we implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate 313 positions, held by Adobe employees worldwide and which impacted all functional areas. The reduction in force was completed in fiscal 2006. The restructuring plan, which is estimated to be completed in fiscal 2007, also includes costs related to the world-wide consolidation of facilities, the cancellation of certain contracts and the write-off of fixed assets located at facilities that will be vacated. During fiscal 2006, the total restructuring charges of $19.7 million included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and costs related to the closure of duplicative facilities and the cancellation of certain contracts. We did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2005 and 2004.

See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these purchased intangibles. 58 Non-operating Income Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Investment gain (loss) $ 61.2 * % $ (1.3 ) * % $ 2.5 Percentage of total revenues 2 % * % * % Interest and other income 67.2 74 % 38.6 * % 14.3 Percentage of total revenues 3 % 2 % 1 % Total non-operating income $ 128.4 244 % $ 37.3 * % $ 16.8 *Percentage is not meaningful. Investment Gain (Loss) Investment gain (loss) consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses of Adobe Ventures, and other direct investments. 2006 2005 2004 Net losses related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $(6.5 ) $(1.0 ) $(0.1 ) Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (0.6 ) Gains from sale of short-term investments 0.1 2.5 Gains from sale of equity investments 67.9 Gains (losses) on stock warrants (0.2 ) 0.2 0.1 Total investment gain (loss) $61.2 $(1.3 ) $2.5 The increase in our investment gain from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies. Interest and Other Income The largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange transactions including hedging gains and losses, and interest expense. Interest and other income increased during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher levels of cash and short term investments and higher rates of return during fiscal 2006. These gains were partially offset by increased costs of our foreign currency hedging program. Interest and other income increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and higher interest rates during fiscal 2005, as well as higher gains on our foreign currency hedging program. 59 Income Tax Provision Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Provision $ 173.9 7 % $ 162.9 3 % $ 158.2 Percentage of total revenues 7 % 8 % 10 % Effective tax rate 26 % 21 % 26 % Our effective tax rate increased five percentage points during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The net increase is primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit on December 31, 2005 and because the 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. In December 2006, after the end of Adobe fiscal year, the federal research and development tax credit was retroactively extended from January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2007 which includes an 11 month period in Adobe 2006 fiscal year. The impact of this new tax law will be reflected in our fiscal 2007 results including an approximately $12 million discrete item in our first quarter fiscal 2007 results for the credit relating to fiscal 2006. Our effective tax rate decreased four percentage points during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a tax benefit recognized as a result of the release of certain deferred tax liabilities in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point due to a variety of factors, including higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate and a reduction of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 2,280.9 34 % $ 1,700.8 30 % $ 1,313.2 Working capital 2,207.1 44 % 1,528.2 38 % 1,107.1 Stockholders equity $ 5,151.9 176 % $ 1,864.3 31 % $ 1,423.5 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll (salaries, bonuses, and benefits), general operating expenses (marketing, travel, office rent) and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2006, of $927.2 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital source of cash was a decrease in other current assets and increases in income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher current tax liabilities related to overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Working capital uses of cash included an increase in trade receivables and decreases in accrued expenses and accrued restructuring. Our trade receivables increased due to an increase in revenue. As compared to the same period last year, our days sales outstanding in trade receivables ( DSO ) increased from 31 days to 48 days. The increase in DSO was due to an increase in revenue in the latter part of the year due to timing of product shipments and an increase in certain receivables from the Macromedia acquisition which have longer payment terms. Accrued expenses decreased because of compensation related costs and other expenses. Accrued restructuring decreased because of payments made during fiscal 2006; please refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 60 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005, of $758.4 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs and marketing expenses. Income taxes payable increased as a result of higher current tax liabilities related to repatriation of certain foreign earnings and overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and other current assets. Our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue during the period. As compared to fiscal 2004, our DSO was 31 days, one day higher than fiscal 2004. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004, of $704.8, million primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Our accounts receivable decreased due to increased levels of cash collections. Working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments. Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 of $195.2 million increased from net cash used in fiscal 2005 of $348.4 million due to the net cash acquired with Macromedia and due to the sale of our minority equity investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. These proceeds were partially offset by purchases of long term investments and acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment as well as net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2006. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 of $348.4 million decreased from net cash used in fiscal 2004 of $351.3 million because there was not an investment in a lease receivable (related to our corporate headquarter office buildings) as there was in 2004. This was partially offset by higher net purchases of short-term investments and payments for acquisition costs in fiscal 2005. Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2006 of $774.7 million increased from net cash used in fiscal 2005 of $246.6 million primarily due to the purchases of treasury stock. Cash used during fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the proceeds related to the issuance of the treasury stock from exercises of employee stock options. Cash used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2006 increased from the prior year due to a higher average cost per share, a higher number of shares being repurchased, and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements (see section titled Stock Repurchase Program On-Going Dilution). Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 of $246.6 million increased from cash used in fiscal 2004 of $224.5 million primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the re-issuance of treasury stock as a result of a lower number of options being exercised. We discontinued our quarterly cash dividend after the payment of the dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. We intend to use the cash previously used to pay the quarterly dividend for our ongoing stock repurchase programs. Under the terms of our lease agreements for our San Jose headquarters, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs. In fiscal 2006, we entered into various agreements with San Jose Water Corporation and certain of its affiliates to acquire land and a building in downtown San Jose for $36.5 million. The building and certain parking areas were used by the San Jose Water Company and will be leased back to San Jose Water Corporation until mid 2008. Additionally, the Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion plan for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. We are also in the process of extending our lease for the Almaden Tower for a five year term with an additional five years at our option. We have received Board approval to purchase a portion of the lease receivable of the lessor as 61 we have done with the East and West Towers. We expect a cash outlay of approximately $90 million when the transaction closes sometime during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We expect to continue our investing activities, including investments in short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. In addition, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in venture capital over the next three to five years in Companies leveraging our platform technologies. Adobe uses professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 77% of Adobe invested balances during fiscal 2006. Within the U.S., the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury notes and highly rated corporate notes. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market and enhanced money market funds for working capital purposes. As of December 1, 2006, $182.3 million of the securities now classified as short-term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within 90 days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents. All investments are made according to policies approved by the Board of Directors. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2007 in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, we have received Board approval to execute a $500 million credit facility which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This credit facility will provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes for a period of up to 5 years. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Stock Repurchase Program On-going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. Refer to Part II, Item 5(c) in this Annual Report for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 1, 2006. As part of this program, on April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of an additional $1.0 billion for stock repurchase commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. This additional $1.0 billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $1.3 billion and $600 million, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. 62 The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval, and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. For fiscal 2006, the $1.3 billion prepayment was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2006 are excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of December 1, 2006 will expire on or before July 19, 2007. As of December 1, 2006 approximately $204.0 million of up-front payments remained under the agreements. At the beginning of fiscal 2007, we entered into an additional structured repurchase agreement with a large financial institution, whereupon we provided the financial institution with a prepayment of $300.0 million which will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet.

(2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See Stock Repurchase Program I On-going Dilution Coverage above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of December 1, 2006, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments The two lease agreements discussed in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to standard financial covenants. As of December 1, 2006 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants. We expect to remain within compliance in the next 12 months. We are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our lease commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of December 1, 2006: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Total non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income * $ 201.4 $ 47.2 $ 73.9 $ 26.4 $ 53.9 * These amounts are net of sublease income. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Statements for further detail regarding our future commitments under these non-cancelable operating leases. 63 Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. Under FIN 45, the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As such, we recognized a $5.2 million liability related to the East and West towers lease that was extended in August 2004. This liability is recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the lease. As of December 1, 2006, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantee remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $2.8 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer or director lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote.
