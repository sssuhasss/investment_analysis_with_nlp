(6) Excludes Amortization , Accretion , the 2007 Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and the 2007 Midas redevelopment . Consolidated Financial Performance Gold revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in the average realized price and consolidated ounces sold. Gold sales increased to 6.5 million ounces in 2009 from 6.2 million ounces in 2008, primarily due to the start-up of Boddington and higher production at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau, partially offset by lower production in Nevada. Copper revenues increased in 2009 from 2008 due to higher sales volume at Batu Hijau and the start-up of Boddington. In addition, our 2009 financial and operating results were impacted by the following: Boddington acquisition costs and revaluation of contingent consideration ($90, pre-tax); Advanced projects, research and development expense ($135, primarily at Boddington, Hope Bay, Nevada growth and Ghana investments); and Loss on the sale of the Kori Kollo operations ($43, pre-tax). Liquidity Our financial position was as follows: December 31, 2009 2008 Total debt $ 4,809 $ 3,237 Newmont stockholders equity $ 10,703 $ 7,291 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,215 $ 435 Marketable equity securities $ 1,175 $ 621 During 2009 our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net cash provided from continuing operations of $2,914; Capital expenditures of $1,769; Issuance of debt of $1,568, net; Net proceeds of $1,234 from the public offering of 34,500,000 shares of common stock; Acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington for $996; Proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau shares to noncontrolling interests of $638; Acquisition of Batu Hijau economic interest from noncontrolling interests for $287; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $196; and Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $394. 44 Table of Contents Looking Forward Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Fluctuations in gold and copper prices; We expect 2010 consolidated gold production of approximately 6.3 to 6.8 million ounces, primarily as a result of the ramp-up of Boddington, partially offset by lower production at Nevada and Yanacocha; Costs applicable to sales gold for 2010 are expected to be approximately $450 to $480 per ounce due to higher energy costs, labor and contracted services and lower expected production at Nevada and Yanacocha; We expect 2010 consolidated copper production of approximately 540 to 600 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.85 to $0.95 per pound; We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1,400 to $1,600 in 2010, with approximately 30% invested in each of the North America and Asia Pacific regions and the remaining 40% at other locations. Approximately 60% of the 2010 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 40% allocated to project development, including the development of the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru; We expect 2010 exploration expenditures of approximately $190 to $220 and 2010 advanced projects, research and development expenditures of approximately $185 to $210; Our 2010 expectations, particularly with respect to production volumes and Costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound, may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and Potential future investments in the Hope Bay project in Canada, the Akyem project in Ghana and the Conga project in Peru will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. Accounting Developments For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Carrying Value of Goodwill At December 31, 2009, the carrying value of goodwill was approximately $188. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill was assigned to various mine site reporting units in the Asia Pacific Segment. Our approach to allocating goodwill was to identify those reporting units that we believed had contributed 45 Table of Contents to such excess purchase price. We then performed valuations to measure the incremental increases in the fair values of such reporting units that were attributable to the acquisitions, and that were not already captured in the fair values assigned to such units identifiable net assets. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis during the fourth quarter, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. To accomplish this, we compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amounts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value is charged to earnings. Our fair value estimates are based on numerous assumptions and it is possible that actual fair value will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels, operating costs and capital requirements are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Mine Site Goodwill The assignment of goodwill to mine site reporting units was based on synergies that have been incorporated into our operations and business plans over time. The amount of goodwill assigned to each segment or reporting unit was based on discounted cash flow analyses that assumed risk-adjusted discount rates over the remaining lives of the applicable mining operations. We believe that triggering events with respect to the goodwill assigned to mine site reporting units could include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant decrease in our long-term gold and copper price assumptions; (ii) a decrease in reserves; (iii) a significant reduction in the estimated fair value of mine site exploration potential; and (iv) any event that might otherwise adversely affect mine site production levels or costs. We performed our annual impairment test of mine site goodwill at December 31, 2009 and determined that the fair value of each mine site reporting unit was in excess of the relevant carrying value at December 31, 2009. For more information on the discounted cash flows used to value mine site reporting units, see Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets, below. Exploration Segment Goodwill In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Exploration Segment was impaired and the full value of goodwill was written-off. The Exploration Segment was responsible for all activities, whether near-mine or greenfield, associated with our efforts to discover new mineralized material that could ultimately advance into proven and probable reserves. As discussed in greater detail below, when performing our Exploration Segment goodwill impairment testing, we used historic additions to proven and probable reserves as an indication of the expected future performance of the Exploration Segment. The Exploration Segment valuation model attributed all cash flows expected to be derived from future greenfield exploration discoveries, to the Exploration Segment. The valuation model included management best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production. Historical proven and probable reserve additions, excluding acquisitions, were used as an indicator of the Exploration Segment ability to discover additional reserves in the future. The valuation model assumed that we would be able to perpetually develop and produce the assumed additions to proven and probable reserves from future discoveries at existing or new mine site reporting units. Actual reserve additions have varied significantly from year to year due to the time required to advance a deposit from initial discovery to proven and probable reserves and based on the timing of when proven and probable reserves can be reported under the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 7. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we performed an impairment test of the Exploration Segment goodwill. Based on the Exploration Segment historic additions to proven and probable reserves and management best estimates of future reserve additions from exploration activities and all revenues and costs associated with their discovery, development and production, the Exploration Segment 46 Table of Contents estimated fair value was negligible. The decreased value attributable to the Exploration Segment resulted primarily from adverse changes in valuation assumptions and the application of a revised industry definition of value beyond proven and probable reserves ( VBPP ). The changes to valuation assumptions included: (i) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of increased spending and reduced exploration success. The revised definition of VBPP ascribes more value to tangible mineral interest than the original definition used. As a result of applying the new definition of VBPP, the higher value ascribed to the Exploration Segment tangible mineral interests reduced the implied value of the Exploration Segment goodwill to a negligible value. Based on the negligible valuation, the Exploration Segment goodwill was impaired and the full $1,122 of goodwill was recorded as a non-cash write-down at December 31, 2007. Merchant Banking Goodwill During June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to cease Merchant Banking activities, and Merchant Banking was subsequently sold in December 2007. Merchant Banking previously provided advisory services to assist in managing our portfolio of operating and property interests. Merchant Banking was also engaged in developing value optimization strategies for operating and non-operating assets, business development activities, merger and acquisition analysis and negotiations, monetizing inactive exploration properties, capitalizing on proprietary technology and know-how and acting as an internal resource for other corporate groups to improve and maximize business outcomes. As a result of the Board approval of management plan to cease Merchant Banking activities, we recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill associated with the Merchant Banking Segment during the second quarter of 2007. Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred, where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in 47 Table of Contents determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and removed at each stockpile average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper in the stockpile. Stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and processed further. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our stockpiles had a total carrying value of $1,387 (Batu Hijau, $834; Nevada, $269; Other Australia/New Zealand, $121; Boddington, $59; others, $104) and $990 (Batu Hijau, $612; Nevada, $214; Other Australia/New Zealand, $95; others, $69), respectively. Costs that are incurred in or benefit from the productive process are accumulated as stockpiles. We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and actual production levels. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2009 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term gold price of $900 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.50 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.80 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, write-downs of stockpiles to NRV totaled $nil, $2 and $14, respectively. Cost allocation to stockpiles and the NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 48 Table of Contents Carrying Value of Ore on Leach Pads Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2009 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $900 per ounce. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2009 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $900 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $2.50 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $0.80 per A$1.00. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded write-downs of $7, $137 and $10, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves and other material that is not part of the measured, indicated or inferred resource base, are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. 49 Table of Contents As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. Derivative Instruments With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Changes in the fair market value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income (loss), except for the effective portion of the change in fair market value of derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. Management applies significant judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair market value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair market value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income (loss) when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against future foreign currency expenditures or future diesel expenditures, where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that such future foreign currency or diesel expenditures are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated income (loss) immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations (Asset Retirement Obligations) Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. The asset retirement obligation is based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with guidance for accounting for asset retirement obligations. Future remediation costs for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. 50 Table of Contents Income and Mining Taxes We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above under Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. At January 1, 2007, we adopted income tax guidance to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 51 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Results Sales gold, net for 2009 increased $1,014 compared to 2008 due to a $103 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges and 384,000 additional ounces sold.

The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to higher diesel costs and higher royalty and workers participation expenses, partially offset by lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau and higher by-product sales. Costs applicable to sales copper decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to lower diesel and mining costs, partially offset by higher labor costs and the start-up of Boddington production. The decrease in 2008 from 2007 was due to lower waste removal costs, partially offset by higher diesel, labor and milling costs. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Amortization increased in 2009 from 2008 due to the start-up of Boddington, higher underground production at Nevada and Jundee, development of North Lantern in Nevada, a full year amortization of Hope Bay infrastructure and higher production at Batu Hijau. Amortization increased in 2008 from 2007 due to increased production at Jundee, Waihi and Ahafo, a larger portion of Nevada production being sourced from the Phoenix and Leeville operations and the start-up of the gold mill at Yanacocha and the power plant in Nevada. Amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of production amortization method for mineral interests and mine development. For a complete discussion, see 54 Table of Contents Results of Consolidated Operations , below. We expect Amortization to increase to approximately $940 to $970 in 2010. The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales and Amortization by operation: Costs Applicable to Sales Amortization Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Gold North America: Nevada $ 1,045 $ 1,022 $ 1,021 $ 261 $ 246 $ 220 La Herradura 42 38 29 11 8 7 Other North America 2 1,087 1,060 1,052 272 254 227 South America: Yanacocha 642 637 490 168 170 160 Asia Pacific: Batu Hijau 118 124 114 30 25 25 Jundee 136 149 138 49 34 26 Kalgoorlie 210 231 191 15 16 24 Tanami 189 220 181 47 39 37 Waihi 57 55 42 25 33 22 Boddington 45 15 755 779 666 181 147 134 Africa: Ahafo 242 205 168 68 63 43 2,726 2,681 2,376 689 634 564 Copper Asia Pacific: Batu Hijau 307 399 450 78 80 96 Boddington 16 4 323 399 450 82 80 96 Other Hope Bay 12 1 Asia Pacific 3 3 3 Corporate and Other 20 20 22 35 24 25 $ 3,049 $ 3,080 $ 2,826 $ 806 $ 738 $ 685 The Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts of $531 in 2007 resulted from the elimination of the 1.85 million ounces of forward sales contracts that would have impacted results in 2008, 2009 and beyond. Midas redevelopment of $11 in 2007 resulted from activities undertaken, during the period in which operations were suspended, to regain entry into the mine in order to resume commercial production following a fatal accident that occurred in June 2007. Exploration decreased to $187 in 2009 from $213 in 2008 due to a reduced drilling program related to the Company focus on net cash flow generation and a more selective and strategic 55 Table of Contents exploration program. We expect Exploration spending to increase to approximately $190 to $220 in 2010. During 2009, we added 6.4 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.8 million equity ounces of depletion. Reserve additions of 6.4 million equity ounces were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Gold Quarry (2.9 million equity ounces), Boddington (1.3 million equity ounces), Tanami (0.5 million equity ounces) and Ahafo (0.5 million equity ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in Australia and South America (0.6 million equity ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 0.3 million equity ounces at Phoenix in Nevada, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million equity ounces. During 2008, we added 5.2 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.7 million equity ounces of depletion. Reserve additions from exploration of 4.4 million equity ounces were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Boddington (1.6 million equity ounces, 66.67% ownership), with most of the remaining additions coming from several open pit and underground sites in Nevada (totaling 1.2 million equity ounces) and from underground sites in Australia (0.7 million equity ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 1.1 million equity ounces, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts at Phoenix in Nevada. The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was an increase of 1.9 million equity ounces. During 2007, we added 0.8 million equity ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 7.3 million equity ounces of depletion. Reserve additions from exploration of 3.5 million equity ounces were primarily due to further extension drilling at Boddington (66.67% ownership), Jundee and Tanami in Australia (2.6 million equity ounces), with the remaining additions from several opn pit and underground sites in Nevada as well as La Herradura in Mexico. The impact of the change in gold price assumption on reserve additions was an increase of 0.7 million equity ounces. Advanced projects, research and development includes the following: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Major projects: Boddington $ 25 $ 3 $ 3 Hope Bay 25 39 Akyem 8 7 6 Conga 4 4 3 Other projects: Technical and project services 24 23 15 Nevada growth 15 12 7 Corporate 14 15 2 Yanacocha sulfides 5 1 5 Tanami optimization 4 4 3 Fort a la Corne JV 1 26 Euronimba 15 7 Other 10 17 11 $ 135 $ 166 $ 62 Advanced projects, research and development includes project management costs, feasibility studies and certain drilling costs. Significant projects include the start-up of Boddington, the Hope Bay gold project in Nunavut, Canada, the Akyem gold project in Ghana and the Conga copper and gold 56 Table of Contents project in Peru. We expect Advanced projects, research and development spending to be approximately $185 to $210 in 2010, an increase from 2009, with a focus on the major projects above. General and administrative expense increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher benefits, mainly pension and other post retirement costs. General and administrative expense remained stable over the period from 2007 to 2008. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was 2.1% in 2009, compared to 2.4% and 2.6% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect General and administrative expenses to be approximately $160 to $170 in 2010. Write-down of goodwill in 2007 was $1,122 ($nil for 2009 and 2008) and was related to the Exploration segment. The impairment resulted primarily from adverse changes in valuation assumptions and the application of a revised industry definition of value beyond proven and probable reserves ( VBPP ). The changes to valuation assumptions included: (i) a significantly lower assumed annual reserve growth rate (from 4% to 3%), (ii) a significant change in the financial markets resulting in a significant increase in the discount rate (from 8% to 10%), and (iii) an increase in finding costs due to a combination of increased spending and reduced exploration success. The revised definition of VBPP ascribes more value to tangible mineral interest than the original definition used by the Company. As a result of applying the new definition of VBPP, the higher value ascribed to the Exploration Segment tangible mineral interests reduced the implied value of the Exploration Segment goodwill to a negligible value. Write-down of property, plant and mine development totaled $7, $137 and $10 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 write-down primarily related to assets in Asia Pacific and South America. The 2008 write-down primarily related to mineral interests and other assets in North America and Asia Pacific. In North America, the Fort a la Corne JV assets were impaired based on 2008 geologic results and potential project economics leading to our decision to cease funding our share of project development costs. The 2007 write-down primarily related to assets in Asia Pacific. For a discussion of our policy for assessing the carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, see Critical Accounting Policies, above. Other expense, net was $383, $351 and $243 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase of $32, or 9%, in 2009 over 2008 is due to $90 of costs related to acquiring the remaining interest in Boddington, a workforce reduction that impacted 3% of our global workforce and an increase in expenses for the Western Australian power plant, partially offset by higher reclamation estimate revisions in 2008 and the recovery of bad debts provided for in 2008. The increase of $108, or 44%, in 2008 over 2007 primarily relates to reclamation estimate revisions for changes in environmental obligation estimates at inactive mines including Mt. Leyshon in Australia and the Midnite mine in Washington, USA. Other income, net was $88, $123 and $100 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease of $35, or 28%, in 2009 over 2008 is primarily related to a decrease in Canadian Oil Sands Trust income due to lower oil prices in 2009 and higher gains on sale of investments and exploration properties in 2008, partially offset by the impairment of investments in Shore Gold Inc. ( Shore ) and Gabriel Resources Ltd. ( Gabriel ) in 2008. The increase of $23, or 23%, in 2008 over 2007 is primarily related to an increase in Canadian Oil Sands Trust income due to significantly higher oil prices through the majority of 2008 and gains on sales of investments and exploration properties in 2008, partially offset by the impairment of investments in Shore and Gabriel in 2008. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest was $120, $135 and $118 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $111, $47 and $50 in each year, respectively. Interest costs decreased in 2009 primarily due to higher capitalized interest, partially offset by additional interest on the $900 and $1,100 senior notes issued in September 2009 and $518 convertible senior notes issued in February 2009. Capitalized interest increased compared to the prior periods due to the construction of Boddington. Interest costs increased in 2008 primarily due to increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility and a full year of interest on the $1,150 convertible senior notes 57 Table of Contents issued in July 2007, partially offset by the repayment of borrowings at Batu Hijau and Australia. We expect Interest expense, net of capitalized interest to be approximately $270 to $290 in 2010 due to lower capitalized interest and higher average levels of debt related to the senior notes issued in 2009. Income tax expense was $788 in 2009, compared to $100 and $190 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rates were 27%, 8% and (49%) in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Without the restructuring that resulted in a $159 tax benefit in 2008 and the $1,122 goodwill impairment charge in 2007 (which is not deductible for tax purposes and for which no related income tax benefit can be claimed), the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 would have been 21% and 26%. The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion, the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, foreign earnings not indefinitely reinvested net of foreign tax credits, earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties, foreign currency translation gains and losses, changes in tax laws, goodwill impairment and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are available to us under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in our consolidated United States income tax return. The deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company. The tax benefits from percentage depletion were $127, $130 and $70 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily is due to the increase in gold price. We operate in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the United States. Many of these differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United States. The effect of these differences is shown in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as either a foreign rate differential or the effect of foreign earnings, net of credits. Differences in tax rates and other foreign income tax law variations make our ability to fully utilize all of our available foreign income tax credits on a year-by-year basis highly dependent on the price of the gold and copper produced by the Company and the costs of production, since lower prices or higher costs can result in our having insufficient sources of taxable income in the United States to utilize all available foreign tax credits. Such credits have limited carry back and carry forward periods and can only be used to reduce the United States income tax imposed on our foreign earnings included in our annual United States consolidated income tax return. The effects of foreign earnings, net of allowable credits, resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $6 for 2009 and an increase in income tax expense of $nil and $13 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effect of different income tax rates in countries where earnings are indefinitely reinvested contributed to a decrease in our income tax expense of $4 for 2009 and an increase in our income tax expense of $20 and $7 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax effect of changes in local country tax laws, as shown in our effective tax reconciliation in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, resulted in no tax effect in 2009 and 2008 and a net tax benefit of $4 in 2007. The net tax benefit in 2007 is primarily related to a decrease in Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates and a decrease in New Zealand tax rates. The need to record valuation allowances related to our deferred tax assets (primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credits) is principally dependent on the following factors: (i) the extent to which the net operating losses and tax credits can be carried back and yield a tax benefit; (ii) our long-term estimate of future average realized minerals prices; and (iii) the degree to which many of the tax laws and income tax agreements that apply to us and our subsidiaries around the world tend to create significant tax deductions early in the mining process. These up-front deductions can give rise to net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards in circumstances where future sources of 58 Table of Contents taxable income may not coincide with available carry forward periods even after taking into account all available tax planning strategies. Furthermore, certain liabilities, accrued for financial reporting purposes, may not be deductible for tax purposes until such liabilities are actually funded which could happen after mining operations have ceased, when sufficient sources of taxable income may not be available. Changes to valuation allowances decreased income tax expense by $32 and $17 in 2009 and 2007 and increased income tax expense by $31 in 2008. The reduction in valuation allowances in 2009 and 2007 are a result of the increase in value of certain marketable securities investments, and higher forecasted taxable income from certain mining operations caused by the increase in the average price of gold and the realization of capital loss benefits. The valuation allowance also decreased in 2009 as a result of a write off of Australian capital losses that had no impact on the Company effective tax rate. The increase in 2008 primarily is related to losses recorded on the decrease in value of certain marketable securities investments. We consolidate certain subsidiaries of which we do not own 100% of the outstanding equity. However, for tax purposes, we are only responsible for the income taxes on the portion of the taxable earnings attributable to our ownership interest of each consolidated entity. Such noncontrolling interests contributed $18, $19 and $4 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as reductions in our income tax expense. Tax expense decreased by $38 and $69 in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and increased by $3 in 2007 relating to the reduction in income taxes resulting from revised estimates of reserves for uncertain income tax positions recorded in jurisdictions where either the statutes of limitations expired or where uncertain income tax positions were settled. Our tax expense decreased by $21 in 2008 due to the U.S. income tax effect of realized translation losses attributable to Canadian dollar-denominated debt instruments that were converted to equity. Because we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings from Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, the obligor on such debt instruments, no offsetting United States deferred income tax effect can be recorded. During 2008, tax expense decreased by $159 related to restructuring the form of one of the Company non-US subsidiaries. This transaction gave rise to a significant loss that allowed the Company to recover income taxes paid in prior years. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 32% in 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Batu Hijau $ 445 $ 98 $ 299 Yanacocha 354 232 108 Other (3 ) (1 ) 3 $ 796 $ 329 $ 410 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2009 from 2008 as a result of increased earnings at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations and Yanacocha Operations) and divestiture of a portion of Batu Hijau in accordance with the provisions of the Contract of Work. The 2008 decrease from 2007 resulted from lower earnings at Batu Hijau partially offset by increased earnings at Yanacocha (see Results of Consolidated Operations, Batu Hijau Operations and Yanacocha Operations). See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our Batu Hijau ownership. 59 Table of Contents Equity income (loss) of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 AGR Matthey Joint Venture $ 5 $ (2 ) $ 1 Regis Resources NL (3 ) (8 ) European Gold Refineries 6 La Zanja (4 ) Euronimba (17 ) $ (16 ) $ (5 ) $ (1 ) Our interest in Regis Resources NL ( Regis Resources ) was diluted in 2009 to a level where we no longer account for our interest in Regis Resources pursuant to the equity method. In 2008, Newmont purchased additional shares of European Gold Refineries ( EGR ) resulting in our consolidation of EGR. Beginning in 2009, we began accounting for our investments in La Zanja (46.94%) and Euronimba (43.5%) on the equity method. Income (loss) from discontinued operations was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Sales gold, net $ 32 $ 75 $ 179 Income (loss) from operations: Kori Kollo $ 1 $ (9 ) $ 22 Royalty portfolio 6 123 Pajingo 8 1 (3 ) 153 Gain on sale of operations: Pajingo 1 8 Zarafshan 77 1 85 Gain on sale of royalty portfolio 905 Loss on impairment of goodwill and other assets (44 ) (1,665 ) Pre-tax loss (43 ) (2 ) (522 ) Income tax benefit (expense) 27 15 (383 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ (16 ) $ 13 $ (905 ) Discontinued operations include the Kori Kollo operation sold in July 2009 and the royalty portfolio and Pajingo operation, both sold in December 2007 and the Zarafshan operation expropriated by the Uzbekistan government in 2006. 60 Table of Contents Gold ounces sold in discontinued operations were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Ounces sold (000): Kori Kollo 37 85 87 Pajingo 171 Total 37 85 258 Less noncontrolling interest (4 ) (10 ) (11 ) Equity (1) 33 75 247 (1) Gold ounces sold attributable to Newmont after noncontrolling interest. In July 2009, we sold our interest in the Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia. As part of the transaction, a reclamation trust fund was established with the proceeds to be made available exclusively to pay for closure and reclamation costs when operations eventually cease. We recorded a $13 liability for the trust fund and recognized a $16 charge, net of tax benefits. In December 2007, we sold substantially all of Pajingo assets for cash and marketable equity securities totaling $23 resulting in a gain of $8. Additional Pajingo asset sales resulted in a gain of $1 in 2008. In June 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan to cease Merchant Banking activities. As part of this plan, we decided to dispose our royalty portfolio assets and a portion of our marketable equity securities portfolio and to cease further investments in marketable equity securities that do not support our core gold mining business. In June 2007, we recorded a $1,665 non-cash charge to impair the goodwill associated with the Merchant Banking Segment. In December 2007, we received net cash proceeds of $1,187 and recognized a gain of $905 related to the sale of the royalty portfolio. In 2008, we recognized additional royalty portfolio revenue of $6 in excess of our 2007 estimate and recorded a $19 tax benefit related to the US tax return true-up on the sale of the royalty portfolio. Our interest in the Zarafshan operation was expropriated by the Uzbekistan government in 2006. In 2007, after pursuing international arbitration, we received proceeds of $80 and recognized a gain of $77 related to the settlement. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax was $882 in 2009 and included non-cash adjustments for a $418 gain in value of marketable securities, a $264 gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $14 net gain related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments and a $186 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax was $1,212 in 2008 and included a $573 loss in value of marketable securities, a $387 loss on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $130 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments and a $122 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our ownership of Batu Hijau. (5) Gold ounces and copper pounds sold attributable to Newmont after noncontrolling interests. Consolidated gold ounces sold increased 6% in 2009 from 2008 due to: higher production from Asia Pacific due to higher ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau and the start-up of Boddington; higher production from South America due to higher mill production from higher grade and throughput at Yanacocha; partially offset by lower production from North America due to lower grade and lower leach placement in Nevada. Consolidated gold ounces sold increased 1% in 2008 from 2007 due to: higher production from South America due to start-up of milling operations; higher production from Africa due to higher ore grades; partially offset by lower production from Asia Pacific due to lower ore grades, throughput and recovery at Batu Hijau. Consolidated copper pounds sold increased 75% in 2009 from 2008 due to higher ore grades and throughput at Batu Hijau and the start-up of Boddington. Consolidated copper pounds sold decreased 32% in 2008 from 2007 due to lower ore grades, throughput and recovery at Batu Hijau. 62 Table of Contents Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold decreased 4% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher production, lower diesel costs and higher by-product credits partially offset by higher royalties and workers participation. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 12% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher diesel, royalty and labor costs, partially offset by higher by-product sales and lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound decreased 54% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher copper production, lower waste removal costs at Batu Hijau, lower diesel costs and a lower co-product allocation of costs to copper at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound increased 31% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower copper production. We expect 2010 consolidated gold production of approximately 6.3 to 6.8 million ounces, primarily due to higher production from Asia Pacific as a result of the ramp-up of Boddington, partially offset by lower production in North America and South America as a result of increased waste stripping and lower ore grades. Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2010 are expected to be approximately $450 to $480 per ounce due to lower expected sales at Nevada and Yanacocha, and higher oil prices, partially offset by the ramp-up of lower cost Boddington production. We expect 2010 consolidated copper production of approximately 540 to 600 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.85 to $0.95 per pound as a result of higher expected oil prices and the ramp-up of slightly higher cost production at Boddington.

Gold ounces sold decreased 10% due to lower mill ore grades and lower leach placement. Open pit ore mined decreased 21% to 29.6 million tons in 2009 due to mine sequencing at Gold Quarry. Underground ore mined increased 10% to 2.7 million tons in 2009 due to higher tonnage at Leeville as well as remnant mining at Carlin East. Mill ore grade decreased 9% due to lower grades from Leeville as well as ramping down and completion of production at Deep Post. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 40% to 11.9 million tons in 2009, primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry, partially offset by the start-up of North Lantern. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower production and higher underground mining costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs and higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 17% due to lower total production, higher underground development costs and a full year of power plant operations. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces sold increased 19% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to higher leach placement. Costs applicable to sales decreased 6% due to higher production and lower fuel costs. 63 Table of Contents 2008 compared to 2007 Nevada, USA. Gold ounces sold in Nevada decreased 5% due to the completion of milling at Lone Tree, lower production at Twin Creeks and reduced ore processing by third parties experiencing operating and financial difficulties, partially offset by higher production from Midas, Leeville and leach pads. Open pit ore mined decreased 12% to 37.4 million tons due to mine sequencing at Twin Creeks and Phoenix. Underground ore mined increased to 2.5 million tons from 1.9 million tons due to an 80% increase at Leeville. Ore milled decreased to 24.8 million tons from 25.5 million tons, while mill ore grade decreased 5% due to processing lower grade Twin Creeks stockpiles. Ore placed on leach pads increased to 19.8 million tons, up from 14.0 million tons, primarily as a result of mine sequencing at Gold Quarry and the start-up of Bobstar. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 5% as lower production, increased diesel and other commodity costs, increased underground mining costs, higher royalties and taxes were partially offset by the completion of higher cost Carlin East mining and Lone Tree processing, start-up of the power plant and higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce increased 18% due to more production being sourced from Leeville, additional haul trucks at Phoenix and the start-up of the power plant. Our Midas operation was suspended from June to October 2007. Mining activities ramped-up and returned to historic production levels during 2008. La Herradura, Mexico. Gold ounces sold increased 10% primarily due to higher leach placement. Costs applicable to sales increased 17% due to increased waste removal and higher fuel costs. Consolidated gold production for North America is expected to decline to approximately 1.7 to 1.9 million ounces in 2010 and 2011 due to lower production from the Carlin operations and the closure of Deep Post, partially offset by anticipated increases at Leeville. Production from the Carlin operations is expected to be impacted by a geotechnical event that occurred at Gold Quarry in late December 2009, limiting access to ore that was originally scheduled to be mined in 2010 and 2011. Following a series of geotechnical, mine planning and ore blending analyses conducted by the Company in January and February, up to approximately 150,000 ounces of gold production are expected to be deferred from Gold Quarry in 2010, with potential additional ounces deferred in 2011. The Company continues to study opportunities to safely accelerate the production of the ounces currently scheduled to be produced in 2012 through 2013. 2010 cost applicable to sales are expected to increase to approximately $575 to $615 per ounce, primarily due to lower production and higher expected diesel and input commodity prices. Based on current mine plans, consolidated gold production in the North America region in 2011 is expected to remain at 2010 levels with the potential for slightly higher production in 2012 primarily due to higher production from new underground mines and open pits from the Nevada growth projects as well as higher production from La Herradura and mining of the deferred ounces at Gold Quarry in Nevada. Costs applicable to sales in 2010 are expected to be approximately $575 to $615 per ounce, primarily due to lower production and higher expected diesel and input commodity prices. Costs applicable to sales in 2011 and 2012 are expected to remain near 2010 levels with the potential of decreasing with the addition of the growth projects in Nevada and La Herradura production. 64 Table of Contents South America Operations Gold Ounces Sold (1) Costs Applicable to Sales (2) Amortization 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) ($ per ounce) ($ per ounce) Yanacocha, Peru 2,068 1,843 1,565 $ 311 $ 346 $ 313 $ 81 $ 92 $ 103 Equity (3) 1,062 946 804 (1) Consolidated gold ounces sold includes noncontrolling interests share (51.35% owned).

Mill production increased 326,200 ounces due to a full year of operation and 44% higher mill ore grade. Leach production decreased by 5% due to the timing of recovery from the leach pads. Ore placed on the leach pads increased to 136.3 million tons from 97.8 million tons at a consistent grade of 0.018 ounces per ton. Costs applicable to sales decreased 10% due to higher production, lower diesel costs and higher by-product credits, partially offset by higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices. Amortization per ounce decreased 12% due to higher production. 2008 compared to 2007 Consolidated gold ounces sold increased 18% due to the start-up of milling operations, partially offset by lower leach production. Ore placed on the leach pads decreased to 97.8 million tons from 98.3 million tons while leach ore grades decreased 5% to 0.018 ounces per ton. Gold production increased by 16% primarily due to 304,200 ounces from the new mill. Start up of the mill occurred in late March and commercial production was achieved in the second quarter of 2008. Costs applicable to sales increased $33 per ounce due to higher diesel and commodity costs and higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices, partially offset by higher gold production and higher by-product credits. Amortization per ounce decreased 11% as a result of higher gold production partially offset by amortization of the new mill. Consolidated gold production in South America is expected to decrease in 2010 to approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million ounces, primarily due to lower tonnage mined and lower grades. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2010 to approximately $360 to $400 per ounce, primarily due to lower gold production and higher contracted services and supplies. Based on current mine plans, assumptions and conditions, consolidated gold production in the South America region for 2011 through 2012 is expected to remain near 2010 levels. Over the same time period, Costs applicable to sales are expected to stabilize. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Yanacocha recorded $28, $18 and $10 to Other expense, net , respectively, related to an agreement with the Peruvian government to provide for a royalty payment for community improvements. The negotiated royalty is based on 3.75% of Yanacocha net income beginning January 1, 2006 for a period of up to five years.

(5) Gold ounces and copper pounds sold attributable to Newmont after noncontrolling interests. 2009 compared to 2008 Jundee, Australia. Gold ounces sold increased 10% due to higher throughput as a result of increased mill utilization and slightly higher grade as a result of more underground ore processed. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 16%, due to higher production and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which decreased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $14 per ounce, partially offset by higher royalties. Amortization per ounce increased 32% due to a higher proportion of underground ore processed. Kalgoorlie, Australia. Gold ounces sold increased 11% due to higher mill throughput, grade and recovery. Grade was higher due to improved ore extraction and less dilution. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 18% due to higher production, lower diesel prices and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rates, which decreased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $29 per ounce. Tanami, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased 20% due to lower throughput as a result of unplanned mill maintenance and lower grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 8%, due to lower production and higher royalties, partially offset by lower mining costs and movements in the 66 Table of Contents Australian dollar exchange rates, which decreased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $33 per ounce. Amortization per ounce increased 48% due to higher capital expenditures and a negative mine life adjustment. Waihi, New Zealand. Gold ounces sold decreased 16% due to the temporary suspension of milling operations as a result of an electrical fire in May, partially offset by higher mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased by 23% due to lower production, higher royalties and higher surface mining costs, partially offset by movements in the New Zealand dollar exchange rates, which decreased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $31 per ounce. Boddington, Australia. Commercial production began effective November 19, 2009 and gold sales were 103,300 ounces at Costs applicable to sales of $468 per ounce on a co-product basis ($352 per ounce on a by-product basis; see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 78). We expect Boddington to produce approximately 1 million ounces annually at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $300 per ounce after copper by-product credits in the first five years. Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Consolidated copper pounds and gold ounces sold increased 72% and 84%, respectively, due to higher mill throughput, grade and recovery due to processing higher grade softer Phase 5 ore compared to ore sourced primarily from lower grade stockpiles in 2008. Total Costs applicable to sales decreased $98 due to lower waste mining, lower diesel prices and lower mining costs. Costs applicable to sales decreased to $0.62 per pound of copper and $214 per ounce of gold (55% and 48% lower, respectively), as a result of higher production. Costs applicable to sales gold also decreased due to a higher co-product allocation of costs to copper due to a higher realized copper price. Amortization per pound of copper and ounce of gold decreased 43% and 35%, respectively, due to higher production. At December 31, 2009, Batu Hijau had copper sales of 158.3 million pounds priced at an average of $3.34 per pound subject to final pricing compared to 82.0 million pounds priced at an average of $1.39 per pound at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, Boddington had copper sales of 1.8 million pounds priced at an average of $3.35 per pound subject to final pricing. On September 18, 2009, Batu Hijau experienced a geotechnical failure in a portion of the west wall of the open pit. Batu Hijau utilizes a number of preventive measures, including radar threshold alarms, to monitor movements in the pit walls. As a result, mobile equipment and personnel were evacuated from the pit prior to the wall failure. Operations were suspended for approximately three weeks in the pit pending a geotechnical review and development of a remediation plan to recommence mining operations. Batu Hijau continued to process lower grade ore from stockpiles during the suspension period. Mining operations returned to normal on October 10, 2009. The geotechnical failure will require the accelerated removal of waste material displaced from the event as well as changes to the balance of Phase 5 and the initiation of Phase 6. In general, the Company expects delays in access to ore previously anticipated in 2010 and 2011 with a marginal decrease in ore mined from the ultimate Phase 6 pit. 2008 compared to 2007 Jundee, Australia. Gold ounces sold increased 27% due to higher grade and a change in the mining sequence resulting in additional high grade ore mined from Westside, partially offset by lower mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales per ounce decreased 15%, attributable to higher production and lower milling costs, partially offset by higher fuel and power costs, and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $13 per ounce. Kalgoorlie, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased 6% due to a draw-down of gold inventories in 2007, not repeated in 2008. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 29%, due to lower production, higher fuel costs, higher waste tons mined and movements in the Australian dollar 67 Table of Contents exchange rate, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $23 per ounce, partially offset by lower milling and administrative costs. Tanami, Australia. Gold ounces sold decreased 17% due to a 15% decrease in mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 46%, due to lower production, higher contracted services costs, higher milling costs and movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate, which increased Costs applicable to sales by approximately $20 per ounce. Waihi, New Zealand. Gold ounces sold increased 52% due to significantly higher mill throughput as mill maintenance was completed in the first quarter of 2007, and milling more Favona underground ore partially offset by 12% lower mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were 14% lower due to higher production and higher by-product credits. Batu Hijau, Indonesia. Consolidated copper pounds and gold ounces sold decreased 32% and 39% respectively, due to lower throughput, ore grade and recovery. Batu Hijau experienced heavy rainfall during the first quarter of 2008 causing minor damage to pit infrastructure, as well as adding significant amounts of water to the pit, delaying planned access to higher grade Phase 4 ore in the bottom of the pit until late in the third quarter of 2008. Mill throughput was 19% lower in 2008 compared to 2007 due to processing harder ores and blending limitations as a majority of 2008 ore was sourced from stockpiles and Phase 5 ore. Ore processed during 2008 was lower in grade and contributed to lower recovery than ores processed in 2007. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper and per ounce of gold increased 31% and 78%, respectively, as a result of higher mining costs due to increased diesel, labor and milling costs, partially offset by lower waste tons mined. Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold also increased as a higher co-product allocation of costs was made to gold as a result of higher gold prices and lower copper prices. Amortization per pound of copper and ounce of gold increased 27% and 70%, respectively, due to lower production. Consolidated gold production for Asia Pacific is expected to increase in 2010 to approximately 2.6 to 2.8 million ounces, primarily as a result of the Boddington ramp-up. Costs applicable to sales are expected to decrease to approximately $400 to $440 per ounce in 2010, primarily driven by the ramp-up of Boddington production, partially offset by higher diesel price and less favorable Australian dollar exchange rate assumptions. We expect consolidated copper production for the Asia Pacific operations of approximately 540 to 600 million pounds at Costs applicable to sales of approximately $0.85 to $0.95 per pound in 2010. Based on current mine plans, assumptions and conditions, consolidated gold production for 2011 through 2012 is expected to remain at the 2010 levels primarily due to the new production at Boddington and extended mine-life at Jundee and Waihi offsetting declining production at Tanami and Batu Hijau. Over the same time period, Costs applicable to sales are anticipated to increase slightly as lower cost production from Boddington will be offset by higher operating costs at Batu Hijau as the Company begins waste stripping Phase 6.

Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to higher labor, contracted services, maintenance and power costs, partially offset by lower diesel prices. Amortization per ounce decreased slightly as higher production was mostly offset by the use of additional mining equipment. 2008 compared to 2007 Gold ounces sold increased 17% due to a 25% increase in mill ore grade and higher throughput, partially offset by an increase in in-process inventory. Total tons mined increased to 50.6 million tons from 44.2 million tons due to equipment additions, increased mining efficiencies and the operation of a third pit. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to higher diesel, power, royalties, maintenance and contract services costs, partially offset by higher production. Amortization per ounce increased 31% due to the use of additional equipment and the operation of a third pit. Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to decrease to approximately 460,000 to 500,000 ounces in 2010 due to mining additional waste material and lower ore grade. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $515 to $555 per ounce are expected for 2010, primarily as a result of lower production, higher diesel prices and higher labor and royalty costs. Based on current mine plans, assumptions and conditions, consolidated gold production and Costs applicable to sales for 2011 through 2012 are expected to remain at the 2010 levels. Development of the fourth pit, Amoma, is on schedule and production is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2010. With the granting of the required mining license by the Ghanaian authorities earlier this year, we are advancing the development of our Akyem project, with completion anticipated in the 2013 to 2014 timeframe. Newmont and other gold companies with production in Ghana, formed a consortium to import power generation equipment and constructed an 80 mega-watt power plant. The plant was commissioned in 2008 and transferred to the Volta River Authority in 2009. As a result, the Ghanaian government has agreed to distribute power proportionately between participating mines and other industrial and commercial customers, if required, to curtail power consumption as a result of power shortages. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates In addition to our domestic operations in the United States, we have operations in Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana and other foreign locations. Our operations sell their production based on U.S. dollar metal prices. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 24%, 27% and 28% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Increases or decreases in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased Costs applicable to sales $41 in 2009 from 2008, and increased Costs applicable to sales $11 in 2008 from 2007, primarily by movements in the Australian dollar. 69 Table of Contents We have a program to hedge up to 85% of our forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2009, we have hedged 60%, 37% and 13% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, at an average rate of 0.77, 0.75 and 0.78, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves in the past. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided from Operations Net cash provided from continuing operations was $2,914, $1,397 and $528 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and was impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) (1) 6,543 6,170 6,097 Average price received per ounce of gold, net (2) $ 977 $ 874 $ 697 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold sold (3) $ 417 $ 436 $ 390 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 507 290 428 Average price received per pound of copper, net (2) $ 2.60 $ 2.59 $ 2.86 Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper sold (3) $ 0.64 $ 1.38 $ 1.05 (1) Includes incremental start-up ounces of 9, 20 and 6 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Incremental start-up includes the removal and production of de minimis saleable materials during development and is recorded as Other income , net of incremental mining and processing costs. (2) After treatment and refining charges and excluding settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts. (3) Excludes Amortization , Accretion , the 2007 Loss on settlement of price-capped forward sales contracts and the 2007 Midas redevelopment . Net cash provided from continuing operations increased $1,517 compared to 2008. Cash flow provided from operations during 2009 was impacted by higher realized gold and copper prices and increased gold and copper sales volume, as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results , a $177 increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities ($78 for accrued tax liabilities, primarily in Asia Pacific, $74 for employee-related liabilities, $58 for other short and long term liabilities, primarily at Asia Pacific, partially offset by a $33 decrease in accounts payable, primarily at Asia Pacific) partially offset by a $378 increase in inventories, stockpiles (primarily in Asia Pacific and North America) and ore on leach pads. Cash flow provided from operations during 2008 was impacted by significantly higher realized gold prices and increased gold sales volume, partially offset by lower realized copper prices and lower copper sales volume and a $343 increase in inventories, stockpiles (primarily at Batu Hijau) and ore on leach pads, a $198 increase in prepaid taxes and a $103 decrease to fund reclamation activities. The 2007 results were negatively impacted by the $578 70 Table of Contents settlement of the price-capped forward sales contracts, $276 payment of pre-acquisition Australia income taxes of Normandy and $174 from the final settlement of copper collar contracts. We are currently planning to contribute at least $60 to our retirement benefit programs in 2010 to bolster plan assets. For additional discussion see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2008, we purchased additional shares of EGR for $7, net of cash acquired, bringing our ownership interest to 56.67% from 46.72%. In November 2008, EGR repurchased 6.55% of its own shares from a noncontrolling shareholder bringing our ownership to 60.64%. 72 Table of Contents Sales and purchases of marketable securities. We had net proceeds of $nil, $nil and $2 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, from auction rate marketable debt securities.

In February 2009 we completed a public offering of 34,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $37 per share for net proceeds of $1,234. Sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests. In November and December 2009, Nusa Tenggara Partnership ( NTP ) completed the sale of 10% and 7% of shares in PTNNT to a third party buyer, respectively. These transactions reduced our ownership interest in PTNNT to 35.44%. Cash proceeds from the sale were $638, with our 56.25% share being $359 and the balance of $279 was paid to our NTP partner. Acquisition of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests. In December 2009, we entered into a transaction with P.T. Pukuafu Indah ( PTPI ), an unrelated noncontrolling partner of PTNNT whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for a pledge of the noncontrolling partner 20% share of PTNNT dividends, net of withholding tax, and the assignment of its voting rights to us. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17% to 52.44% at December 31, 2009. 73 Table of Contents Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests. We paid dividends of $394, $389 and $270 to noncontrolling interests during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 dividends included $279 for our NTP partner share of the sale of the 17% interest in Batu Hijau. Dividends paid to common stockholders.

Corporate Revolving Credit Facility The Company has an uncollateralized $2,000 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks, which matures in April 2012. The facility contains a letter of credit sub-facility. Interest rates and facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest at an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.28% or the lead bank prime interest rate. Facility fees accrue at an annual rate of 0.07% of the aggregate commitments. The Company also pays a utilization fee of 0.05% on the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit outstanding under the facility for each day on which the sum of such loans and letters of credit exceed 50% of the commitments under the facility. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the facility fees were 0.07% of the commitment. There was $452 and $519 outstanding under the letter of credit sub-facility at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, $nil was borrowed under the facility. 74 Table of Contents Debt Covenants The 5 7 / 8 % and 8 5 / 8 % senior notes, and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions.

At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults. Shelf Registration Statement In October 2007, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. In accordance with SEC rules and in advance of the expiration of the October 2007 shelf registration statement, we filed a replacement registration statement with the SEC in September 2009, which became automatically effective upon filing. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1-3 4-5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Debt (1) $ 8,191 $ 333 $ 1,478 $ 854 $ 5,526 Capital lease obligations (1) 246 52 148 45 1 Remediation and reclamation obligations (2) 1,434 56 173 123 1,082 Employee-related benefits (3) 531 88 92 83 268 Uncertain income tax liabilities and interest (4) 38 38 Operating leases 88 12 31 16 29 Minimum royalty payments 231 23 68 45 95 Purchase obligations (5) 844 115 287 66 376 Other (6) 398 129 236 9 24 $ 12,001 $ 808 $ 2,513 $ 1,241 $ 7,439 75 Table of Contents (1) Amounts represent principal ($4,809) and estimated interest payments ($3,628) assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these remediation and reclamation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding remediation and reclamation liabilities, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension funding and other benefit plans. Pension plan funding beyond 2014 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (4) At December 31, 2009, our uncertain income tax liability, interest and penalty payable were $25 and $13, respectively. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2010 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. (5) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (6) Other includes accrued Boddington contingent consideration of $85 and other obligations which are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements including labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $1,073 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We also provide a contingent support line of credit to PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara of which our pro rata share is $11. We have sales agreements to sell copper concentrates at market prices as follows, in thousands of tons: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Batu Hijau 941 598 411 402 573 Boddington 215 254 231 243 254 904 Nevada 50 46 1,206 898 642 645 827 904 For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Future Cash Flows We anticipate that significant capital expenditures in future years (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and noncontrolling interests is expected to impact Net cash used in investing activities and Net cash used in financing activities exceeding Net cash provided by operations . Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. Although we currently carry a large cash balance, we may determine that it may be necessary or appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or 76 Table of Contents sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized spot price of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided by operations to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of Costs applicable to sales in Asia Pacific. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided from operations to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Net cash provided from operations will also be impacted in 2010 as a result of planned contributions of at least $60 for our post-retirement benefit programs. Based on expected production of between 6.3 and 6.8 million ounces of gold and between 540 and 600 million pounds of copper in 2010, we do not anticipate reasonably expected variations in our production profile alone to influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2010. Environmental Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. We conduct our operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation costs are based principally on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $698 and $594, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties, of which $36 is classified as current liabilities expected to be spent in 2010. In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. We believe that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $161 and $163 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, we believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 148% greater or 3% lower than the amount accrued at December 31, 2009. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are charged to Other expense, net in the period estimates are revised. We spent $20, $39 and $13 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $18 as a current liability expected to be spent in 2010. Expenditures for 2009 related primarily to Grass Valley in California, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site, the Dawn mill site and the Con 77 Table of Contents mine from the Miramar acquisition. Expenditures for 2008 related primarily to Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado as well as the Mt. Leyshon property. Expenditures for 2007 related primarily to legacy Normandy properties in Australia, the McCoy/Cove property in Nevada and the Dawn mill site. Included in capital expenditures were $131, $231 and $91 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . Included in Other long-term assets is $11 of restricted cash that is legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to the Con mine from the Miramar acquisition. Included in Investments are $10 and $5 of long-term marketable debt securities and long-term marketable equity securities, respectively, that are legally pledged for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations related to the San Jose Reservoir in Yanacocha. For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward-Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1, Business. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items, income or loss from discontinued operations and the permanent impairment of assets, including marketable securities and goodwill. Management determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on 78 Table of Contents a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to adjusted net income as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 1,297 $ 831 $ (1,895 ) Boddington acquisition costs 44 Boddington contingent consideration 15 Impairment of assets 8 182 1,161 Net gain on asset sales (16 ) (47 ) (7 ) Income tax estimate revisions (159 ) Loss on settlement of gold contracts 358 Discontinued operations (income) loss 11 (15 ) 907 Adjusted net income $ 1,359 $ 792 $ 524 Adjusted net income per share (1) $ 2.79 $ 1.74 $ 1.16 (1) Calculated using weighted average number of shares outstanding, basic and diluted. By-product costs applicable to sales Revenue and Costs applicable to sales for Boddington are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements for both gold and copper due to the significant portion of copper production (approximately 15-20% of total revenue based on the latest life-of-mine plan and metal price assumptions). The co-product method allocates costs applicable to sales to each metal based on specifically identifiable costs where applicable and on a relative proportion of revenue values for other costs.
