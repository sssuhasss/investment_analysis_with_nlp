Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. As a result of the acquisitions and divestures discussed below, many comparisons between periods will be difficult or impossible. In December 2012, we closed on the sale certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million (included in discontinued operations). For the year ended December 31, 2012, these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day. In July 2012, we acquired producing and non-producing assets from Three Rivers Operating Company (the Three Rivers Acquisition ) for cash consideration of approximately $1.0 billion. The Three Rivers Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. The results of operations prior to July 2012 do not include results from the Three Rivers Acquisition. In February 2012, we acquired producing and non-producing assets from Petroleum Development Corporation (the PDC Acquisition ) for cash consideration of approximately $189.2 million. The PDC Acquisition was primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility. The results of operations prior to March 2012 do not include results from the PDC Acquisition. In November 2011, we acquired three entities affiliated with OGX Holdings II, LLC (collectively the OGX Acquisition ) for cash consideration of approximately $252.0 million. The results of operations prior to December 2011 do not include results from the OGX Acquisition. In March 2011, we closed our divestiture of our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on this sale of approximately $135.9 million (included in discontinued operations). For the first quarter of 2011, these assets produced an average of 1,369 Boe per day. Certain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development and exploration of producing oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We refer to our three core operating areas as the (i) New Mexico Shelf, where we primarily target the Yeso formation both on a vertical and horizontal basis, (ii) Delaware Basin, where we primarily target the Bone Spring formation (which includes the Avalon Shale and the Bone Spring sands) and the Wolfcamp shale, all primarily on a horizontal basis, and (iii) Texas Permian, where we primarily target the Wolfberry, a term applied to the combined Wolfcamp and Spraberry horizons, primarily on a vertical basis and the Wolfcamp shale on a horizontal basis. Oil comprised 61.1 percent of our 502.9 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2013 and 62.8 percent of our 33.6 MMBoe of production for 2013. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 91.1 percent of our proved developed producing PV-10 and 80.3 percent of our approximately 6,530 gross wells at December 31, 2013. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. 44 Financial and Operating Performance Our financial and operating performance for 2013 included the following highlights: Net income was $ 251.0 million ($2.39 per diluted share), as compared to net income of $431.7 million ($ 4.15 per diluted share) in 2012. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to: $ 123.7 million loss on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to a $ 127.4 million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges during the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily related to commodity future price curves at the respective measurement periods; $197.5 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A ) expense from continuing operations, primarily due to increased continuing operations production from (i) costs incurred associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2013 and (ii) our acquisitions in 2012 ; $111.7 million increase in oil and natural gas production costs from continuing operations due in part to increased production related to our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2012 and 2013 and our acquisitions in 2012; $65.4 million non-cash impairment charge in 2013 due primarily to downward adjustments to our economically recoverable proved reserves due to (i) reduced well performance and (ii) decreases in estimated realized natural gas prices, primarily on non-core natural gas properties in our New Mexico Shelf area ; $36.0 million increase in general and administrative expense due to (a) including an adjustment to our bonus accrual for services related to 2012 of approximately $5.2 million ($0.15 per Boe) recorded in 2013 and (b) an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities, both from (i) increased drilling and exploration activities and (ii) our acquisitions in 2012; $35.9 million increase in interest expense due to a 17.4 percent increase in the weighted average debt balance outstanding between the periods, primarily related to our acquisitions in 2012 and the timing of our capital expenditures; $28.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2013 related to the tender offer and redemption of our 8.625% senior notes ; and $19.6 million pre-tax gain from discontinued operations in 2013 related to the post-closing adjustments to the divestiture of certain non-core assets in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $38.0 million of income from operations before income taxes related to the same assets in 2012; partially offset by: $500.1 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues from continuing operations as a result of a 20 percent increase in production coupled with a 6 percent increase in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities) . Average daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 20 percent from 76,397 Boe per day during 2012 to 92,150 Boe per day during 2013. The increase was primarily attributable to our successful drilling efforts during 2012 and 2013 , with the remaining increase due to approximately 7,200 Boe per day attributable to our acquisitions in 2012 , offset in part by normal production declines and curtailed production in our New Mexico Shelf area, discussed later. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $124.5 million to $1,362.0 million for 2013, as compared to $1,237.5 m illion in 2012, primarily due to increased oil and natural gas revenues, partially offset by (i) increases in oil and natural gas production costs, general and administrative expense and interest expense and (ii) a larger negative variance in working capital changes, which adjust for the timing of receipts and payments of actual cash. 45 Long-term debt was increased by approximately $0.5 billion during 2013, primarily as a result of the spending on drilling in excess of our operating cash flow. At December 31, 2013, availability under our credit facility was approximately $2.2 billion. Commodity Prices Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to (i) relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, (ii) natural gas and natural gas liquids market uncertainty and (iii) a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids include: economic stimulus initiatives in the United States; worldwide and continuing economic struggles in Eurozone nations economies; political and economic developments in the Middle East; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; the effect of energy conservation efforts; the price and availability of alternative fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation; the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities; the quality of the oil we produce; the overall global demand for oil; and overall North American natural gas supply and demand fundamentals, including: the United States economy impact, weather conditions, and liquefied natural gas deliveries to the United States. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2013. 46 Oil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. In general, average oil and natural gas prices have increased during 2013 compared to 2012. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, as well as the high and low NYMEX price for the same periods: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Average NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl) $ 98.05 $ 94.19 $ 95.07 Natural gas (MMBtu) $ 3.73 $ 2.83 $ 4.03 High and Low NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl): High $ 110.53 $ 109.77 $ 113.93 Low $ 86.68 $ 77.69 $ 75.67 Natural gas (MMBtu): High $ 4.46 $ 3.90 $ 4.85 Low $ 3.11 $ 1.91 $ 2.99 Further, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $102.43 and $91.66 per Bbl and $5.56 and $4.01 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2014 to February 18, 2014. At February 18, 2014, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $102.43 per Bbl and $5.55 per MMBtu, respectively. 47 Recent Events 2014 capital budget . In November 2013, we announced our 2014 capital budget of approximately $2.3 billion. Our 2014 capital program is expected to continue focusing on drilling in the Delaware Basin and Midland Basin. The 2014 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and cost, will exceed our cash flow. We expect our cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital expenditure needs during 2014. However, our capital budget is largely discretionary, and if we experience sustained oil and natural gas prices significantly below the current levels or substantial increases in our costs, we may reduce our capital spending program to manage the level of capital outspend. 2014 Capital Budget Drilling and completion costs: New Mexico Shelf $ 152 Delaware Basin 1,406 Texas Permian 459 Facilities and other capital in our core operating areas 188 Acquisition of leasehold acreage 75 Geological and geophysical data 20 Total $ 2,300 During 2013, we spent approximately 69 percent of our capital budget on horizontal drilling. We plan on spending approximately 91 percent of our 2014 capital budget on horizontal drilling. Three-year accelerated growth plan . We have adopted an accelerated drilling program for the next three years which we expect will double production by 2016. By accelerating activity across our assets, we believe that we can deliver average annual organic production growth over the next three years in excess of our historical annual average while increasing oil mix and reducing leverage ratios. Tender offer and redemption of senior notes and senior notes issuance . On June 3, 2013, we received tenders and consents from the holders of approximately $225.6 million in aggregate principal amount, or approximately 75.2 percent, of our outstanding 8.625% senior notes due 2017 (the 8.625% Notes ) in connection with a cash tender offer for any and all of the 8.625% Notes at a price of 106.922 percent of the unpaid principal amount. On June 21, 2013, we redeemed the remaining outstanding 8.625% Notes not purchased in the tender offer at a redemption price of 106.516 percent of the unpaid principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through June 20, 2013. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of the 8.625% Notes of approximately $28.6 million for the year ended Dec ember 31, 2013 . On June 4, 2013, we completed the issuance of an additional $850 million in principal amount of our 5.5% senior notes due 2023 (the Offering ) at 103.75 percent of par (resulting in a 4.884% yield) for net proceeds of approximately $867.8 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to fund the tender offer and redemption of the 8.625% Notes and to pay down amounts outstanding on the credit facility. See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our debt balance at December 31, 2013. 48 Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2013, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net liability of $66.2 million. All of our counterparties to these financial derivatives are parties to our credit facility and have their outstanding debt commitments and derivative exposures collateralized pursuant to our credit facility. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments and their collateralization under our credit facility, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. We currently have no reason to believe that our counterparties to these commodity derivative contracts are not financially viable. Our credit facility does not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. New commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2013, we entered into the following additional oil basis swaps and natural gas price swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total Oil Basis Swaps: (a) 2014: Volume (Bbl) - 637,000 2,024,000 1,748,000 4,409,000 Price per Bbl $ - $ (1.88) $ (1.50) $ (1.45) $ (1.54) Natural Gas Swaps: (b) 2014: Volume (MMBtu) 351,000 364,000 368,000 276,000 1,359,000 Price per MMBtu $ 4.35 $ 4.35 $ 4.35 $ 4.35 $ 4.35 (a) The basis differential price is between Midland WTI and Cushing WTI. (b) The index prices for the natural gas price swaps are based on the NYMEX Henry Hub last trading day futures prices. 49 Results of Operations The following table sets forth summary information concerning our production and operating data from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The table below excludes production and operating data that we have classified as discontinued operations, which is more fully described in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from (i) the Three Rivers Acquisition for periods prior to July 2012, (ii) the PDC Acquisition for periods prior to March 2012 and (iii) the OGX Acquisition for periods prior to December 2011. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Production and operating data from continuing operations: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 21,126 16,859 13,446 Natural gas (MMcf) 75,054 66,613 51,118 Total (MBoe) 33,635 27,961 21,966 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 57,879 46,063 36,838 Natural gas (Mcf) 205,627 182,003 140,049 Total (Boe) 92,150 76,397 60,180 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 91.76 $ 87.96 $ 91.34 Oil, with derivatives (Bbl) (a) $ 89.79 $ 89.29 $ 83.61 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 5.08 $ 5.06 $ 7.62 Natural gas, with derivatives (Mcf) (a) $ 5.21 $ 5.07 $ 8.13 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 68.97 $ 65.08 $ 73.65 Total, with derivatives (Boe) (a) $ 68.01 $ 65.93 $ 70.09 Operating costs and expenses per Boe: Lease operating expenses and workover costs $ 7.85 $ 6.90 $ 6.69 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 5.69 $ 5.39 $ 5.96 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 22.97 $ 20.56 $ 18.21 General and administrative $ 5.04 $ 4.79 $ 4.48 (a) Includes the effect of cash settlements received from (paid on) commodity derivatives not designated as hedges: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ (41,616) $ 22,411 $ (103,969) Natural gas derivatives 9,275 1,125 25,739 Interest rate derivatives - - (6,624) Total cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives $ (32,341) $ 23,536 $ (84,854) The presentation of average prices with derivatives is a non-GAAP measure as a result of including the cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives that are presented in our statements of cash flows. This presentation of average prices with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective periods and presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives in a manner consistent with the presentation generally used by the investment community. 50 The following table sets forth summary information from our discontinued operations concerning our production and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The discontinued operations presentation is the result of reclassifying the results of operations from the divestitures of our (i) Bakken assets in March 2011 and (ii) non-core assets in December 2012 which are more fully described in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Production and operating data from discontinued operations: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 1,144 1,246 Natural Gas (Mcf) 3,978 2,596 Total (MBoe) 1,807 1,678 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 3,126 3,415 Natural gas (Mcf) 10,869 7,112 Total (Boe) 4,937 4,600 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 88.60 $ 89.80 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 4.67 $ 7.64 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 66.37 $ 78.50 Operating costs and expenses per Boe: Lease operating expenses and workover costs $ 12.95 $ 12.01 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 6.01 $ 6.89 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 16.68 $ 18.15 General and administrative (a) $ (1.38) $ (1.35) (a) Represents the fees received from third-parties for operating oil and natural gas properties that were sold. We reflect these fees as a reduction of general and administrative expenses. 51 The following tables present selected production and operating data for the fields which represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Year Ended December 31, 2013 West Yeso Wolfberry Central Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 3,509 2,157 Natural gas (MMcf) 11,238 8,122 Total (MBoe) 5,382 3,511 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 93.05 $ 90.42 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 6.15 $ 6.24 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 73.51 $ 70.00 Production costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses including workovers $ 9.30 $ 12.38 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 5.68 $ 6.25 Year Ended December 31, 2012 West Yeso Wolfberry Central Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 3,402 4,053 Natural gas (MMcf) 10,399 14,915 Total (MBoe) 5,135 6,539 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 88.22 $ 88.52 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 6.14 $ 6.28 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 70.87 $ 69.19 Production costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses including workovers $ 7.45 $ 7.43 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 5.11 $ 5.97 Year Ended December 31, 2011 West Yeso Yeso Wolfberry Central East Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 2,735 3,923 2,848 Natural gas (MMcf) 7,794 14,124 8,058 Total (MBoe) 4,034 6,277 4,191 Average prices: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 93.00 $ 91.51 $ 91.26 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 8.82 $ 8.85 $ 7.78 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 80.09 $ 77.11 $ 76.97 Production costs per Boe: Lease operating expenses including workovers $ 4.71 $ 7.30 $ 9.03 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 5.25 $ 6.78 $ 6.52 52 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $2,319.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $500.1 million (27 percent ) from $1,819.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This increase was primarily due to an increase in the realized oil price and increased production due to (i) successful drilling efforts during 2012 and 2013 and (ii) production from the Three Rivers Acquisition, which closed in July 2012. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 21,126 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 4,267 MBbl (25 percent ) from 16,859 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2012 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $91.76 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 4 percent from $87.96 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2012 ; total natural gas production was 75,054 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 8,441 MMcf (13 percent ) from 66,613 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2012 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $5.08 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2013 , a slight increase from $5.06 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Historically, approximately 55 to 80 percent of our total natural gas revenues were derived from the value of the natural gas liquids, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. Because of our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues historically, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) has reflected a price greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price. The deterioration of our realization percentage between comparable periods was primarily related to a combination of (i) a higher average NYMEX natural gas price between comparable periods ($3.73 per MMBtu in 2013 compared to $2.83 per MMBtu in 2012) and (ii) a lower price being received for the value of our natural gas liquids included within our natural gas revenue stream. We estimate that between the comparable periods, the value we received per gallon of natural gas liquids decreased approximately 13 percent, which is primarily the result of an increase in the supply of natural gas liquids from the significant industry drilling in liquid-prone areas. During the fourth quarter of 2013, severe winter weather events across the Permian Basin had a significant impact on our production and drilling operations. We experienced widespread power outages, heavy icing, trucking curtailments, and facility freeze-ups across all three of our core areas. We estimate that these weather events reduced our volumes for 2013 by approximately 114 MBoe. The natural gas processing infrastructure in our New Mexico Shelf area has struggled to support the rapid growth of natural gas supply due to increased drilling by us and other producers over the recent past. During the second quarter of 2013, we noted that (i) certain additional natural gas processing capacity that was scheduled to be operational had been delayed to later in 2013 and (ii) approximately 20 MMcf per day of natural gas processing capacity, located near our recent drilling activity, had been taken out of service due to mechanical issues, which we expect to return to service during the first half of 2014. During the second half of 2013, some of the effects of these infrastructure issues were mitigated through (i) temporarily moving additional natural gas volumes to other third party processors and (ii) an improvement in operating run times and operational efficiencies of certain third party processors. We estimate these infrastructure constraints, which in part caused us to flare limited natural gas volumes, reduced our volumes for 2013 by approximately 515 MBoe. As a result, we noted during the second quarter of 2013 that we were redirecting a portion of our remaining New Mexico Shelf drilling budget to other areas, such as the Delaware Basin, until sufficient natural gas processing infrastructure is implemented and performing at consistent levels. 53 Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 248,436 $ 7.39 $ 182,716 $ 6.53 Taxes: Ad valorem 22,979 0.68 13,695 0.49 Production 168,585 5.01 137,106 4.90 Workover costs 15,436 0.46 10,226 0.37 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 455,436 $ 13.54 $ 343,743 $ 12.29 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expenses were $248.4 million ($7.39 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which was an increase of $65.7 million (36 percent) from $182.7 million ($6.53 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to increased continuing operations production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2012 and 2013 and the acquisitions in 2012. The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) expansion of our production in areas with underdeveloped infrastructure causing a broader use of rental equipment, (ii) increased lease operating expenses per Boe related to our properties acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition as compared to our legacy properties and (iii) some minimal costs increases in services. Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations of our Texas properties and the increase in the number of wells primarily associated with our 2012 and 2013 drilling activity in our Texas Permian area, the Texas portion of the Delaware Basin and the Texas properties acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition. Production taxes per unit of production were $5.01 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of 2 percent from $4.90 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase was directly related to the increase in commodity prices. Over the same period, our per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 6 percent. Workover expenses were approximately $15.4 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2013 and 2012 amounts related primarily to routine workovers in the Texas Permian and New Mexico Shelf areas performed to increase or restore production . Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 Geological and geophysical $ 27,690 $ 16,581 Exploratory dry hole costs 29,514 7,518 Leasehold abandonments 49,758 12,395 Other 2,587 3,346 Total exploration and abandonments $ 109,549 $ 39,840 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, primarily relating to our Delaware Basin area, was approximately $27.7 million and 54 $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 is due to our increased drilling and exploration activity in the Delaware Basin area. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our assessment of our activity on our northern Midland Basin acreage position. Our initial wells on this acreage were uneconomic. We have no further plans to invest in this position. Accordingly, we recognized $14.8 million in exploratory dry hole costs and $34.9 million in leasehold abandonments in 2013. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily related to (i) partial expensing of unsuccessful horizontal laterals on two wells in the Delaware Basin, (ii) an unsuccessful vertical well in the New Mexico Shelf area that was testing the eastern boundaries of the area, (iii) partial expensing of unsuccessful horizontal laterals in the New Mexico Shelf area and (iv) the northern Midland Basin wells (noted above). Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 were primarily related to (i) expensing an unsuccessful lateral on a horizontal well due to mechanical issues in the Delaware Basin area, (ii) expensing a dry hole that logged no pay in the Lower Abo formation in the New Mexico Shelf area and (iii) expensing the costs of drilling a well that experienced mechanical issues in the Texas Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , we recorded approximately $49.8 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to (i) abandonment of the northern Midland Basin acreage position, (ii) expiration of non-prospective acreage in the Delaware Basin area and (iii) abandonment of non-core prospects in the New Mexico Shelf and Texas Permian areas. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded approximately $12.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our New Mexico Shelf area. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 755,952 $ 22.48 $ 561,291 $ 20.07 Depreciation of other property and equipment 15,195 0.45 12,376 0.44 Amortization of intangible asset - operating rights 1,461 0.04 1,461 0.05 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 772,608 $ 22.97 $ 575,128 $ 20.56 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 93.42 $ 91.21 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 3.67 $ 2.76 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $756.0 million ($22.48 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $194.7 million (35 percent) from $561.3 million ($20.07 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) increased production associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2012 and 2013, (ii) increased production associated with our acquisitions in 2012 and (iii) higher depletion rates. The increase in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due (i) drilling deeper, higher-cost wells in less proven areas and (ii) increasing production in our newer asset areas, such as the Delaware Basin, where we have a higher depletion rate than our legacy assets, such as the New Mexico Shelf. More of our drilling capital is spent drilling higher-cost horizontal wells, much of which is in areas that have not had significant drilling activity or historically been developed vertically. Generally, when transitioning to a horizontal program, (i) well costs are higher as efficiencies from optimization of drilling and completion methodologies have yet to be realized and (ii) our ability to record proved reserves is limited under the rules associated with recognizing proved reserves, in part due to the limited amount of horizontal wells in the area and the lack of historical well production performance. As a result of these factors, the change in our production amongst our assets, discussed above, and our significant horizontal drilling activities in the Delaware Basin, we have seen increases in our overall depletion rate over the past year to $22.48 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $20.07 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2012. 55 The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with our increase in depreciation of other property and equipment related to buildings and other items as a result of our increased number of employees. The amortization of the intangible asset is a result of the value assigned to the operating rights that we acquired in an acquisition. The intangible asset is currently being amortized over an estimated life of 25 years. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to downward adjustments to the economically recoverable proved reserves associated with declines in well performance and decreases in estimated realized natural gas prices we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $65.4 million during the second quarter of 2013, which was primarily attributable to non-core natural gas related properties in our New Mexico Shelf area. We did not recognize any impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2012. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 153,199 $ 4.55 $ 118,256 $ 4.23 Non-cash stock-based compensation 35,078 1.04 29,872 1.07 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (18,462) (0.55) (14,332) (0.51) Total general and administrative expenses $ 169,815 $ 5.04 $ 133,796 $ 4.79 General and administrative expenses were approximately $169.8 million ($5.04 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $36.0 million (27 percent) from $133.8 million ($4.79 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase in general and administrative expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to (a) a charge in 2013 to adjust our bonus accrual for services related to 2012 of approximately $5.2 million and (b) an increase in salary and the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities of approximately $30.1 million, which includes a $7.5 million increase related to non-cash stock-based compensation, both from (i) increased drilling and exploration activities and (ii) our acquisitions in 2012; offset in part by an approximate $2.3 million net benefit to stock-based compensation related to forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards associated with two of our former officers. Additionally, the increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements of $4.1 million, which is due to more wells operated as a result of continued drilling activity, offset overall general and administrative expenses. The increase in overall general and administrative expenses per Boe of $0.25 was primarily due to the factors discussed above, partially offset by (i) increased production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2012 and 2013, (ii) increased production from our acquisitions in 2012 and (iii) increased third-party operating fee reimbursements. As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $18.5 million and $14.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements was primarily comprised of approximately $1.3 million attributable to the wells acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition, with the remaining increase primarily due to increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated as a result of continued drilling activity period over period . 56 (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 Gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ (133,890) $ 127,293 Natural gas derivatives 10,238 150 Total gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges $ (123,652) $ 127,443 The following table represents our cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 Cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ (41,616) $ 22,411 Natural gas derivatives 9,275 1,125 Total cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges $ (32,341) $ 23,536 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which can be volatile. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, and to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2013 2012 Interest expense $ 218,581 $ 182,705 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility 2.3% 2.3% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes 6.1% 6.6% Total weighted average interest rate 5.7% 5.6% Weighted average credit facility balance $ 327,488 $ 694,984 Weighted average senior notes balance 3,117,222 2,238,611 Total weighted average debt balance $ 3,444,710 $ 2,933,595 The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012 was due primarily to (i) borrowings associated with our acquisitions in 2012 and (ii) capital expenditures in excess of our cash flows. The increase in interest expense was due to an overall increase in the weighted average balance of debt and a slightly increased weighted average interest rate due to a higher percentage of our debt outstanding as senior notes which carry a higher interest rate than our credit facility. 57 Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax expense of $118.2 million and $251.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was 33.1 percent and 38.1 percent, respectively. We recorded a $21.9 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to a decrease in our estimated overall state tax rate utilized to record our net deferred tax liability. During 2013, the state of New Mexico passed legislation to phase in a tax rate reduction over the next five years from 7.6 percent in 2013 to 5.9 percent in 2018. Additionally, we continuously evaluate the state apportionment, and based on our current forecast, along with the New Mexico rate declines, we have revised our state rate. Excluding the effect of the New Mexico state rate reduction and the insignificant true up on the 2012 tax return, our effective rate would have been 38.8 percent in 2013, which would approximate a more normalized effective income tax rate. We are evaluating the impact of the tangible property regulations which were passed by the Internal Revenue Service in September 2013 and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. We do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. In December 2012, we closed the sale of certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million. As a result of post-closing adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2013, we made a positive adjustment to gain (loss) on disposition of assets of approximately $19.6 million. We recognized income from discontinued operations of $12.1 million and $23.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The results of operations of these assets are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and are described in more detail in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 58 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,819.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $202.0 million (12 percent ) from $1,617.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 . This increase was primarily due to an increase in the realized oil price and increased production due to (i) successful drilling efforts during 2011 and 2012, (ii) production from the OGX Acquisition which closed in November 2011, (iii) production from the PDC Acquisition which closed in February 2012 and (iv) production from the Three Rivers Acquisition which closed in July 2012. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 16,859 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of 3,413 MBbl (25 percent ) from 13,446 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2011 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $87.96 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2012 , a decrease of 4 percent from $91.34 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2011 ; total natural gas production was 66,613 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of 15,495 MMcf (30 percent ) from 51,118 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2011 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $5.06 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2012 , a decrease of 34 percent from $7.62 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2011 . Historically, approximately 55 to 80 percent of our total natural gas revenues were derived from the value of the natural gas liquids, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. Because of our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues historically, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) has reflected a price greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price. The deterioration of our realization percentage between comparable periods was primarily related a lower price being received for the value of our natural gas liquids included within our natural gas revenue stream. We estimate that between the comparable periods, the value we received per gallon of natural gas liquids decreased approximately 27 percent, which is primarily the result of an increase in the supply of natural gas liquids from the significant industry drilling in liquid-prone areas. Additionally, the NYMEX gas prices between comparable periods ($2.83 per MMBtu in 2012 compared to $4.03 per MMBtu in 2011) decreased 29 percent between comparable periods which minimized the decrease in the realization percentage of the NYMEX natural gas price. Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 182,716 $ 6.53 $ 145,020 $ 6.60 Taxes: Ad valorem 13,695 0.49 8,854 0.40 Production 137,106 4.90 122,187 5.56 Workover costs 10,226 0.37 1,868 0.09 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 343,743 $ 12.29 $ 277,929 $ 12.65 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes. Lease operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 included a $3.1 million ($0.13 per Boe) underestimate of costs in periods prior to 2011. 59 Lease operating expenses were $182.7 million ($6.53 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which was an increase of $37.7 million (26 percent) from $145.0 million ($6.60 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2012, (ii) the acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 and (iii) an increase in cost of services, primarily labor related, due to the increased demand for services and related labor in the Permian Basin offset by an underestimate of costs in prior periods to 2011 as mentioned above. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) the $0.13 per Boe included in the year ended December 31, 2011 related to an underestimate of costs in prior periods to 2011 mentioned above and (ii) additional production from our wells successfully drilled which were completed in 2011 and 2012 where we are receiving benefits from economies of scale, offset in part by cost increases in services, primarily labor related. Ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations of our Texas properties and the increase in the number of wells primarily associated with our 2011 and 2012 drilling activity in our Texas Permian area and the Texas properties acquired in the PDC Acquisition and the Three Rivers Acquisition. Production taxes per unit of production were $4.90 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2012 , a decrease of 12 percent from $5.56 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2011 . The decrease was directly related to the decrease in natural gas prices offset by our increase in oil and natural gas revenues related to increased volumes. Over the same period, our per Boe prices (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 12 percent. Workover expenses were approximately $10.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2012 amounts related primarily to workovers in the New Mexico Shelf and Texas Permian areas, while the 2011 amounts related primarily to activity in the Texas Permian area performed primarily to restore production. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2012 2011 Geological and geophysical $ 16,581 $ 4,466 Exploratory dry hole costs 7,518 1,067 Leasehold abandonments 12,395 5,350 Other 3,346 511 Total exploration and abandonments $ 39,840 $ 11,394 Our geological and geophysical expense, which primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data, geophysical data and core analysis, primarily relating to our Delaware Basin and Texas Permian areas, was approximately $16.6 million and $4.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 were primarily related to (i) expensing an unsuccessful lateral on a horizontal well due to mechanical issues in the Delaware Basin area, (ii) expensing a dry hole that logged no pay in the Lower Abo formation in the New Mexico Shelf area and (iii) expensing the costs of drilling a well that experienced mechanical issues in the Texas Permian area. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recorded approximately $12.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our New Mexico Shelf area. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded approximately $5.4 million of leasehold abandonments, which related to non-core prospects in our New Mexico Shelf area. 60 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 561,291 $ 20.07 $ 392,859 $ 17.88 Depreciation of other property and equipment 12,376 0.44 5,702 0.26 Amortization of intangible asset - operating rights 1,461 0.05 1,461 0.07 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 575,128 $ 20.56 $ 400,022 $ 18.21 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 91.21 $ 92.71 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 2.76 $ 4.12 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $561.3 million ($20.07 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $168.4 million (43 percent) from $392.9 million ($17.88 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to (i) capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2012 and (ii) costs associated with our 2011 and 2012 acquisitions. The increase in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) the properties acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition having a higher rate per Boe than our legacy wells, (ii) drilling deeper, higher-cost wells and (iii) the decrease in the natural gas price between periods utilized to determine proved reserves. More of our drilling capital is spent drilling higher-cost horizontal wells, much of which is in areas that have not had significant drilling activity or historically been developed vertically. Generally, when transitioning to a horizontal program, (i) well costs are higher as efficiencies from optimization of drilling and completion methodologies have yet to be realized and (ii) our ability to record proved reserves is limited under the rules associated with recognizing proved reserves, in part due to the limited amount of horizontal wells in the area and the lack of historical well production performance. As a result of these factors, the change in our production amongst our assets, discussed above, and our significant horizontal drilling activities in the Delaware Basin, we have seen increases in our overall depletion rate over the past year to $20.07 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $17.88 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with our increase in depreciation of other property and equipment related to buildings and other items as a result of our increased number of employees. The amortization of the intangible asset is a result of the value assigned to the operating rights that we acquired in an acquisition . The intangible asset is currently being amortized over an estimated life of 25 years. Impairment of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Due primarily to downward adjustments to the economically recoverable proved reserves associated with well performance on certain natural gas assets in our New Mexico Shelf area, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. We did not recognize any impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2012. 61 General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 118,256 $ 4.23 $ 90,376 $ 4.11 Non-cash stock-based compensation 29,872 1.07 19,271 0.88 Less: Third-party operating fee reimbursements (14,332) (0.51) (11,122) (0.51) Total general and administrative expenses $ 133,796 $ 4.79 $ 98,525 $ 4.48 General and administrative expenses were $133.8 million ($4.79 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $35.3 million (36 percent) from $98.5 million ($4.48 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salary and in the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities of approximately $26.7 million, which includes an increase of $10.6 million related to non-cash stock-based compensation, both from (i) increased drilling and exploration activities and (ii) our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012. The increase in general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to (i) an increase in salary, including non-cash stock-based compensation, and in the number of employees and related personnel expenses to handle our increased activities of $0.99 per Boe, which includes an increase of $0.38 per Boe related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense; offset in part by (i) increased production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2011 and 2012, (ii) additional production associated with our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 and (iii) increased third-party operating fee reimbursements. As the operator of certain oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest, we earn overhead reimbursements during the drilling and production phases of the property. We earned reimbursements of $14.3 million and $11.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. This reimbursement is reflected as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in third-party operating fee reimbursements is primarily due to drilling and completing wells in which we own a lower working interest resulting in increased third-party income. 62 (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2012 2011 Gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ 127,293 $ (28,589) Natural gas derivatives 150 6,109 Interest rate derivatives - (870) Total gain (loss) on derivatives not designated as hedges $ 127,443 $ (23,350) The following table represents the Company's cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2012 2011 Cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges: Oil derivatives $ 22,411 $ (103,969) Natural gas derivatives 1,125 25,739 Interest rate derivatives - (6,624) Total cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives not designated as hedges $ 23,536 $ (84,854) Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which can be volatile. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, and to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 Interest expense $ 182,705 $ 118,360 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility 2.3% 2.6% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes 6.6% 7.3% Total weighted average interest rate 5.6% 6.0% Weighted average credit facility balance $ 694,984 $ 500,484 Weighted average senior notes balance 2,238,611 1,312,500 Total weighted average debt balance $ 2,933,595 $ 1,812,984 The increase in weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the corresponding period in 2011 was due primarily to (i) borrowings associated with our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 and (ii) timing of our capital expenditures. The increase in interest expense was due to an overall increase in the weighted average 63 debt balance, offset in part by a lower weighted average interest rate due to (i) the weighted average debt balance of credit facility borrowings bearing a lower interest rate than our senior notes and (ii) our recent senior note issuances having lower interest rates than historical issuances. Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax expense of $251.0 million and $261.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 38.1 percent and 38.4 percent, respectively. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax. In December 2012, we closed the sale of certain of our non-core assets for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million. As a result of post-closing adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2013, we made a positive adjustment to gain (loss) on disposition of assets of approximately $19.6 million. In March 2011, we closed our divestiture of our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $135.9 million. We recognized income from discontinued operations of $23.5 million and $128.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The results of operations of these assets are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and are described in more detail in Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 64 Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility or proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 totaled $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion respectively. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow expenditures is the timing of payments. The 2013 expenditures were funded in part from borrowings under our credit facility. 2014 capital budget . In November 2013, we announced our 2014 capital budget of approximately $2.3 billion. Our 2014 capital program is expected to continue focusing on drilling in the Delaware Basin and Midland Basin. The 2014 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, will exceed our cash flow. We expect our cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital expenditure needs during 2014. However, our capital budget is largely discretionary, and if we experience sustained oil and natural gas prices significantly below the current levels or substantial increases in our costs, we may reduce our capital spending program to manage the level of capital outspend. Three-year accelerated growth plan. Our increased capital budget for 2014 was adopted in connection with our accelerated drilling program for the next three years, which we expect will double production by 2016. By accelerating activity across our assets, we believe that we can deliver annual organic production growth in excess of our historical average while increasing oil mix and reducing leverage ratios. Although we cannot provide any assurance, we have historically attempted to fund our non-acquisition expenditures with our available cash and cash flow as adjusted from time to time; however, we may also use our credit facility, or other alternative financing sources, to fund such expenditures. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, technological and competitive developments and market conditions. In addition, under certain circumstances, we would consider increasing or reallocating our capital spending plans. Other than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise. Acquisitions. Our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties totaled approximately $0.1 billion, $1.3 billion and $0.5 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The significant acquisitions in 2012 are related to the PDC and Three Rivers Acquisitions. Expenditures for leasehold acreage acquisitions (which are expenditures we generally provide for in our planned capital expenditures) included in the total above were approximately $ 67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Divestitures. In December 2012, we closed the sale of certain non-core assets, a portion of which were acquired in the Three Rivers Acquisition, for cash consideration of approximately $503.1 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million (included in discontinued operations). For the year ended December 31, 2012 these assets produced an average of 4,937 Boe per day. We estimate that the proved reserves of these assets at closing were approximately 35.3 MMBoe. We used the net proceeds from this divestiture to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. In March 2011, we sold our Bakken assets for cash consideration of approximately $195.9 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the disposition of assets (included in discontinued operations) of approximately $135.9 million. For the first quarter of 2011, these assets produced an average of 1,369 Boe per day. We used the net proceeds from this divestiture to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. 65 Contractual obligations. Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, cash interest expense on debt, operating lease obligations, drilling commitments, employment agreements with executive officers, derivative liabilities and other obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 : Payments Due by Period Less than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than (in thousands) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long-term debt (a) $ 3,600,000 $ - $ 250,000 $ - $ 3,350,000 Cash interest expense on debt (b) 1,766,802 273,419 403,982 398,500 690,901 Operating lease obligations (c) 17,135 5,922 7,646 1,395 2,172 Drilling commitments (d) 17,868 17,038 830 - - Employment agreements with officers (e) 5,930 5,930 - - - Derivative liabilities (f) 67,789 53,701 14,088 - - Asset retirement obligations (g) 101,593 4,481 22,163 4,602 70,347 Total contractual obligations $ 5,577,117 $ 360,491 $ 698,709 $ 404,497 $ 4,113,420 (a) See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

See Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 66 Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities (including the cash settlements received from (paid on) derivatives not designated as hedges presented in our investing activities) and borrowings under our credit facility. Based on current commodity prices and capital costs, we believe our 2014 capital expenditures budget, excluding acquisitions, will exceed our cash flow, and we will fund our short falls with borrowings under our credit facility. We believe that we have adequate availability under our credit facility to fund any cash flow deficits, though we could reduce our capital spending program to remain substantially within our cash flow. The following table summarizes our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,362,020 $ 1,237,478 $ 1,199,458 Net cash used in investing activities (1,896,794) (2,240,444) (1,651,418) Net cash provided by financing activities 531,915 1,005,504 451,918 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,859) $ 2,538 $ (42) Cash flow from operating activities. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $500.1 million; offset in part by (i) cash increases in oil and natural gas production costs of approximately $ 111.7 million, (ii) cash increases in general and administrative expense and interest expense of approximately $36.0 million and $35.9 million, respectively, and (iii) approximately $83.6 million of negative variances in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2012 over 2011 was principally due to increases in our oil and natural gas production as a result of (a) our PDC Acquisition and Three Rivers Acquisition and (b) our exploration and development program, offset in part by (i) the divestitures in 2012 and 2011, (ii) decreases in average realized oil and natural gas prices, (iii) cash increases in oil and natural gas production costs of approximately $65.8 million, (iv) cash increases in general and administration expense and interest expense of $35.3 million and $64.3 million, respectively, and (v) approximately $20.1 million of positive variances in operating assets and liabilities. Our net cash provided by operating activities also includes a reduction of $83.6 million, $0.5 million and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we invested $1.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, for capital expenditures on oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow expenditures is the timing of payments. The 2013, 2012 and 2011 expenditures were funded in part from borrowings under our credit facility. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially lower during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to our Three Rivers Acquisition in 2012. This decrease was offset in part by (i) an increase in our exploration and development expenditures in 2013 and (ii) a $477.3 million decrease in proceeds from the disposition of assets related to the divestiture of non-core assets in 2012. Cash flows used in investing activities were substantially higher during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 due to (i) our PDC Acquisition and Three Rivers Acquisition in 2012 and (ii) an increase in our exploration and development expenditures in 2012 over 2011; offset in part by a $296.1 million increase in proceeds from the disposition of assets related to the divestiture of non-core assets in 2012 as compared to the Bakken asset divestiture in 2011. Cash flow from financing activities. Below is a description of our financing activities. During 2013, 2012 and 2011 we completed the following significant capital markets activities: 67 In June 2013, we issued $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2023 at 103.75 percent of par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $867.8 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to fund the tender offer and redemption of the 8.625% Notes at a price of 106.922 percent of the unpaid principal amount. The remaining proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding on the credit facility. See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our debt balance at December 31, 2013. in August 2012, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2023 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $688.6 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. in March 2012, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2022 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $590.0 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility. in May 2011, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% senior notes due 2022 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $587.1 million. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facility . Our credit facility has a maturity date of April 25, 2016. Our borrowing base is $3.0 billion until the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination in April 2014, and commitments from our bank group total $2.5 billion. Between scheduled borrowing base redeterminations, the Company and the lenders (requiring a 66 2/3 percent vote), may each request one special redetermination. At December 31, 2013 our availability to borrow additional funds was approximately $2.2 billion based on bank commitments of $2.5 billion . Advances on our credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (i) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank ( JPM Prime Rate ) (3.25 percent at December 31, 2013 ) or (ii) a Eurodollar rate (substantially equal to the LIBOR). The credit facility interest rates of Eurodollar rate advances and JPM Prime Rate advances varied, with interest margins ranging from 150 to 250 basis points and 50 to 150 basis points, respectively, per annum depending on the debt balance outstanding on our credit facility. We pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment ranging from 37.5 to 50 basis points per annum, depending on utilization of the borrowing base. In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. Over the last three years, we have demonstrated our use of the capital markets by issuing senior unsecured debt. There are no assurances that we can access the capital markets to obtain additional funding, if needed, and at what cost and terms. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in oil and natural gas companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time to time by our board of directors. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our credit facility. Liquidity. Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $21 thousand of cash on hand. At December 31, 2013 , the commitments under our credit facility were $2.5 billion, which provided us with approximately $2.2 billion of available borrowing capacity. Upon a redetermination, our $3.0 billion borrowing base could be substantially reduced. There is no assurance that our borrowing base will not be reduced, which could affect our liquidity. Debt ratings . We receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor Ratings Group, Inc. ( S&P ) and Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P corporate rating for us is BB+ with a stable outlook. Moody corporate rating for us is Ba2 with a stable outlook. S&P and Moody consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Book capitalization and current ratio . Our book capitalization at December 31, 2013 was $7.4 billion, consisting of debt of $ 3.6 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 3.8 billion. Our debt to book capitalization was 49 percent and 47 percent at 68 December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.69 to 1.0 at December 31, 2013 as compared to 0.62 to 1.0 at December 31, 2012. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets, and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that we are unable to control or predict. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received from continuing operations an average of $91.76 per barrel of oil and $5.08 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $87.96 per barrel of oil and $5.06 per Mcf of natural gas in the year ended December 31, 2012. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004, and that has continued until recently, oil prices have increased significantly. The higher oil price led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs, but also on capital costs. 69 Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of business combinations, valuation of financial derivative instruments and income taxes. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under this method, exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing properties are sold. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties or projects are periodically assessed for impairment of value by considering future drilling plans, the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of two to 31 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. 70 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Future Cash Flows This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2013, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with SEC guidelines. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2013 was based on an unweighted average twelve month WTI posted price of $93.42 per Bbl for oil and a Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $3.67 per MMBtu for natural gas. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future net cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this report as of December 31, 2013 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2013 Standardized Measure on a 12-month average of commodity prices on the first day of the month and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. Our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase, reducing future earnings. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our proved properties for impairment. Asset Retirement Obligations There are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and, generally, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows, including cash flows from risk adjusted proved reserves. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions in estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with GAAP, we calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation using various valuation methods. The valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value. The Company utilizes (a) the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, (b) the average of the high and low stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and (c) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. See Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding our stock-based compensation. 71 Valuation of Business Combinations In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must record assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we utilize estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. We make future price assumptions to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows were discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rates determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rates are subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future net cash flows of the unproved reserves were reduced by additional risk-weighting factors. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in a higher depletion expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Valuation of Financial Derivative Instruments In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. In addition, we have used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price-sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties creditworthiness. All derivative instruments are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value of $66.2 million at December 31, 2013. In order to determine the fair value at the end of each reporting period, we compute discounted cash flows for the duration of each commodity derivative instrument using the terms of the related contract. Inputs consist of published forward commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate. We compare these prices to the price parameters contained in our hedge contracts to determine estimated future cash inflows or outflows. We then discount the cash inflows or outflows using a combination of published LIBOR rates, Eurodollar futures rates and interest swap rates. The fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities include a measure of credit risk based on average published yields by credit rating. In addition, for collars, we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility, market prices and contract parameters. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we reported a $123.7 million loss on commodity derivative instruments. We compare our estimates of the fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments with those provided by our counterparties. There have been no significant differences. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes in jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our overall tax rate using a combination of the federal tax rate and a blend of enacted state tax rates. Acquisitions or dispositions of assets could change the apportionment of our state taxes, which would impact our overall tax rate. 72 Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, which are based on numerous judgments and assumptions inherent in the determination of future taxable income, at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes and tax credits. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our income tax returns. Material changes to our tax accruals may occur in the future based on audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters. Recent Accounting Pronouncements None. 73
