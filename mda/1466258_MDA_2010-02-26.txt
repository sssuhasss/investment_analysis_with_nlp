Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Organization Ingersoll-Rand plc (IR-Ireland), an Irish public limited company, and its consolidated subsidiaries (we, our, the Company) is a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables, secure homes and commercial properties, and increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies, each with strong brands and leading positions within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Club Car , Hussmann , Ingersoll-Rand , Schlage , Thermo King and Trane . We are dedicated to inspiring progress for our customers, shareholders, employees and communities by achieving: Dramatic Growth , by focusing on innovative solutions for our customers; Operational Excellence , by pursuing continuous improvement in all of our operations; and Dual Citizenship , by bringing together the talents of all Ingersoll Rand people to leverage the capabilities of our global enterprise. To achieve these goals and to become a more diversified company with strong growth prospects, we transformed our enterprise portfolio by divesting cyclical, low-growth and asset-intensive businesses. In addition, our acquisition strategy has helped deliver more consistent revenue and earnings performance across all phases of the economic cycle. Aside from our portfolio transformation, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream, which includes revenues from parts, service, used equipment and rentals. We also intend to continuously improve the efficiencies, capabilities, products and services of our high-potential businesses. On July 1, 2009, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), a Bermuda company, completed a reorganization to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company of Ingersoll Rand from Bermuda to Ireland. As a result, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company effective July 1, 2009. All references related to the Company prior to July 1, 2009 relate to IR-Limited. Ireland Reorganization On March 5, 2009, our board of directors approved a reorganization of the Company that would change the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent company from Bermuda to Ireland (the Ireland Reorganization). The first step in the Ireland Reorganization was the establishment of IR-Limited tax residency in Ireland, which occurred in March 2009. Subsequently, IR-Ireland replaced IR-Limited as the ultimate parent company pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law (the Scheme of Arrangement). Major milestones to complete the Scheme of Arrangement were as follows: On April 1, 2009, IR-Limited formed IR-Ireland as a direct subsidiary. 28 Table of Contents On April 20, 2009, IR-Limited petitioned the Supreme Court of Bermuda to order the calling of a meeting of the Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited to approve the Scheme of Arrangement. On April 23, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda ordered IR-Limited to seek the approval of its Class A common shareholders on the Scheme of Arrangement. On June 3, 2009, IR-Limited received the requisite approval from its Class A common shareholders. On June 11, 2009, the Supreme Court of Bermuda issued an order (the Sanction Order) approving the Scheme of Arrangement. On June 30, 2009, IR-Limited filed the Sanction Order with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies and, at 12:01 a.m. on July 1, 2009 (the Transaction Time) the following steps occurred simultaneously: All fractional shares of IR-Limited held of record were cancelled and IR-Limited paid to each holder of fractional shares that were cancelled an amount based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the IR-Limited Class A common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on June 29, 2009. All previously outstanding whole Class A common shares of IR-Limited were cancelled. IR-Limited issued to IR-Ireland 319,166,220 Class A common shares. IR-Ireland issued 319,166,220 ordinary shares to holders of whole IR-Limited Class A common shares that were cancelled as a part of the Scheme of Arrangement. All previously outstanding ordinary shares of IR-Ireland held by IR-Limited and its nominees were acquired by IR-Ireland and cancelled for no consideration. As a result of the Ireland Reorganization, IR-Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of IR-Ireland and the Class A common shareholders of IR-Limited became ordinary shareholders of IR-Ireland. The Ireland Reorganization did not have a material impact on our financial results. Ingersoll-Rand plc will still continue to be subject to United States Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements and prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Shares of Ingersoll-Rand plc will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol IR , the same symbol under which the Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited Class A common shares previously traded. At the Transaction Time, IR-Limited completed the transfer of all the outstanding shares of Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) to Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International), another wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in Bermuda, whereupon IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as an issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, under the indentures governing the Company outstanding notes, medium-term notes and debentures. IR-Ireland and IR-Limited also fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment obligations of IR-International, IR-Global and Ingersoll-Rand Company, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of IR-Limited incorporated in New Jersey (IR-New Jersey), as the case may be, as the issuers of debt securities under these indentures. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred by Trane. In addition, any securities issued by the Company that were convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Class A common shares of IR-Limited became convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into the ordinary shares of IR-Ireland. On July 1, 2009, IR-Global amended and restated its commercial paper program (the Commercial Paper Program) pursuant to which IR-Global may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2.25 billion. Under the Commercial Paper Program, IR-Global may issue notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International has provided an irrevocable and 29 Table of Contents unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program. Pursuant to the terms of our credit facility entered into on August 12, 2005 and our credit facility entered into on June 27, 2008 (the Credit Facilities), at the Transaction Time, IR-Ireland and IR-International became guarantors to such Credit Facilities. In connection therewith, IR-Ireland and IR-International entered into Addendums on July 1, 2009 to become parties to the Credit Facilities. In connection with the Transaction, effective as of the Transaction Time, IR-Ireland assumed the existing obligations of IR-Limited under the equity incentive plans and other similar employee award plans of Ingersoll Rand (collectively, the Plans), including all awards issued thereunder. Furthermore, the Plans have been amended to provide (1) that ordinary shares of IR-Ireland will be issued, held available or used to measure benefits as appropriate under the Plans, in lieu of shares of IR-Limited, including upon exercise of any options or share appreciation rights or upon the vesting of restricted stock units or performance units issued under those Plans; and (2) for the appropriate substitution of IR-Ireland for IR-Limited in those Plans. Trends and Economic Events We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of our product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. Since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008, we have seen weaker demand for many of our products and services. Although the challenging and difficult end market environments in which we operate are showing signs of stabilization, albeit at lower levels, we are still operating in a depressed economic climate. Despite the challenging economic environment, we continue to execute our business strategy. The divestiture of both Compact Equipment and the Road Development business unit in 2007, in addition to the acquisition of Trane in 2008, have enabled us to become more balanced across the products we offer. In addition, our current enterprise-wide restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 are designed to streamline the footprint of our manufacturing facilities and reduce our general and administrative cost base. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. For 2010, we expect current market conditions to continue to impact our financial results. U.S. and European non-residential construction markets are expected to remain weak; however, some of our end markets are showing signs of stabilization. Despite the current market environment, we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which will fuel our future growth. Acquisition of Trane At the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Trane. Trane, previously named American Standard Companies Inc., provides systems and services that enhance the quality and comfort of the air in homes and buildings around the world. 30 Table of Contents Trane systems and services have leading positions in premium commercial, residential, institutional and industrial markets, a reputation for reliability, high quality and product innovation and a powerful distribution network. Trane 2007 annual revenues were $7.5 billion. We paid a combination of (i) 0.23 of an IR-Limited Class A common share and (ii) $36.50 in cash, without interest, for each outstanding share of Trane common stock. The total cost of the acquisition was approximately $9.6 billion, including change in control payments and direct costs of the transaction. We financed the cash portion of the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, commercial paper and a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility. The components of the purchase price were as follows: In billions Cash consideration $ 7.3 Stock consideration (Issuance of 45.4 million IR-Limited Class A common shares) 2.0 Estimated fair value of Trane stock options converted to 7.4 million IR-Limited stock options 0.2 Transaction costs 0.1 Total $ 9.6 As a result of the acquisition, the results of the operations of Trane have been included in the statement of financial position at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the full year of 2009 and since the Acquisition Date in 2008. For further details on the acquisition of Trane, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Significant events in 2009 In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth. Our segments are now as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies. As part of the change, we eliminated the Air Conditioning Systems and services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and the Residential Solutions segment. See Note 24 in the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the segment realignment. During 2009, we completed a comprehensive financing program that significantly enhanced our liquidity and debt profile. Actions taken include the issuance of $1.0 billion in long-term debt (Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes) in April 2009 and the replacement of our Trane accounts receivable purchase program in March 2009 with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments. The proceeds from our debt issuance were used to repay the $950.0 million outstanding under our senior unsecured bridge loan facility. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated enterprise-wide restructuring actions in order to streamline both our manufacturing footprint and our general and administrative cost base. We have incurred approximately $182.1 million of costs associated with our restructuring programs since the fourth quarter of 2008, $111.4 million of which occurred during 2009. These combined restructuring actions generated approximately $194 million of annual pretax savings for 2009. Significant events in 2008 As discussed in Acquisition of Trane above, on June 5, 2008, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Trane for approximately $9.6 billion. 31 Table of Contents In August 2008, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt pursuant to the shelf registration statement. This issuance consisted of $250 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due in 2010, $600 million 6.000% Senior Notes due in 2013 and $750 million 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited, which directly owns 100% of the subsidiary issuer, IR Global Holding Company Limited. The net proceeds from the offering were used to partially reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge loan facility, which had a balance of $754 million at December 31, 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we tested goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. As a result of decreased global equity valuations, the tightening of industrial and retail end markets and a resulting decline in our 2009 projected financial performance, we incurred a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $3,710.0 million, $3,385.0 million after-tax. Significant events in 2007 On November 30, 2007, we completed the sale of our Bobcat, Utility Equipment and Attachments business units (collectively, Compact Equipment) to Doosan Infracore for cash proceeds of approximately $4.9 billion, subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. Compact Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment including skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers; portable air compressors, generators, light towers; general-purpose light construction equipment; and attachments. We are currently in the process of resolving the final purchase price adjustments with Doosan Infracore. On April 30, 2007, we completed the sale of our Road Development business unit to AB Volvo (publ) for cash proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. The Road Development business unit manufactured and sold asphalt paving equipment, compaction equipment, milling machines and construction-related material handling equipment. During 2007, we repurchased 39.7 million common shares at a cost $1,999.9 million under our existing $4 billion share repurchase program. This repurchase program was originally authorized by the Board of Directors in December 2006 to repurchase up to $2 billion and subsequently expanded to $4 billion in May 2007. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data 2009 % of Revenues 2008 % of Revenues 2007 % of Revenues Net revenues $ 13,195.3 $ 13,227.4 $ 8,763.1 Cost of goods sold (9,645.1 ) 73.1% (9,748.1 ) 73.7% (6,272.0 ) 71.6% Selling and administrative expenses (2,708.6 ) 20.5% (2,343.1 ) 17.7% (1,433.3 ) 16.3% Asset impairment - (3,710.0 ) - Operating income (loss) 841.6 6.4% (2,573.8 ) -19.5% 1,057.8 12.1% Interest expense (302.2 ) (245.4 ) (136.2 ) Other, net 19.7 63.2 30.2 Earnings (loss) before income taxes 559.1 (2,756.0 ) 951.8 (Provision) benefit for income taxes (71.3 ) 208.6 (204.4 ) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 487.8 (2,547.4 ) 747.4 Discontinued operations, net of tax (11.6 ) (57.4 ) 3,242.6 Net earnings (loss) 476.2 (2,604.8 ) 3,990.0 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (24.9 ) (20.0 ) (23.3 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc $ 451.3 $ (2,624.8 ) $ 3,966.7 Diluted net earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders: Continuing operations $ 1.41 $ (8.54 ) $ 2.48 Discontinued operations (0.04 ) (0.19 ) 10.95 Net earnings (loss) $ 1.37 $ (8.73 ) $ 13.43 Net Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 0.2%, or $32.1 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -15.5 % Pricing 0.8 % Currency exchange rates -1.4 % Acquisitions 15.9 % Total -0.2 % The acquisition of Trane increased net revenues by $2,096.3 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 15.9% of the year-over-year change in revenues, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date. Excluding the results of Trane, revenues decreased by 16.1%, or $2,128.4 million, which resulted from lower volumes and product mix (16%) and an unfavorable currency impact (1%). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing (1%). The Trane commercial and residential HVAC businesses also experienced substantial volume declines during the year. 33 Table of Contents Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 50.9%, or $4,464.3 million, compared with the same period of 2007, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -4.3 % Pricing 2.6 % Currency exchange rates 1.7 % Acquisitions 50.9 % Total 50.9 % The acquisition of Trane on June 5, 2008 increased revenues by $4,401.3 million compared to the same period in 2007. The increase, which represented 50.2% of the year-over-year change in revenues, was a consequence of 2008 reported results including activity since the Acquisition Date. Excluding the results of Trane, revenues increased by 0.7%, or $63.0 million. Softening overall demand in many major end-markets was the primary driver of the volume reduction. However, we continued to make progress in increasing recurring revenues, which improved by 6% over prior year and accounted for 19% of net revenues in 2008. Cost of Goods Sold For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of goods sold decreased by $103.0 million, or 1.1% compared to the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Trane increased cost of goods sold by $1,421.8 million, which contributed 14.6% to the year-over-year change. Excluding the results of Trane, cost of goods sold decreased by $1,524.8 million, or 15.7% as a result of increased productivity actions and expense reduction across the businesses. These actions helped to mitigate the impact of lower volumes due to the continued global weakness in our major end markets. As a result, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased to 73.1% from 73.7%. In addition, cost of goods sold included $58.3 million of restructuring costs compared to restructuring and integration costs of $56.7 million in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of goods sold increased by $3,476.1 million compared to the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Trane, which contributed $3,330.8 million to the year-over-year increase. As a result, cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 73.7% compared with 71.6% for the same period of 2007. In addition, cost of goods sold included $56.7 million of restructuring and integration costs compared to restructuring costs of $24.8 million in 2007. Higher material costs and unfavorable business and product mix more than offset price increases. In addition, decreased leverage due to lower volumes contributed to the year-over-year increase. Selling and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2009, selling and administrative expense increased by $365.5 million, or 15.6% compared to the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Trane increased selling and administrative expenses by $558.5 million, which contributed 23.8% to the year-over-year change. Excluding the results of Trane, selling and administrative expense decreased by $193.0 million, or 8.2% as a result of increased productivity actions and expense reduction across the businesses. These actions partially offset the dramatic decline in volume experienced during 2009. As a result, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 20.5% compared with 17.7% for the same period of 2008. In addition, selling and administrative expense included $53.1 million of restructuring costs compared to $34.2 million of restructuring and integration costs in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, selling and administrative expense increased by $909.8 million compared to the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of Trane, which contributed $877.3 million to the year-over-year-increase. As a result, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.7% compared with 16.3% for the same period of 2007. In addition, selling and administrative expense included $34.2 million of restructuring and integration costs compared to $3.9 million of restructuring costs in 2007. Decreased leverage due to lower volumes more than offset expense reduction and price increases. 34 Table of Contents Asset Impairment During the fourth quarter of 2008, we tested goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. As a result of decreased global equity valuations, the tightening of industrial and retail end markets and a resulting decline in our 2009 projected financial performance, we incurred a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $3,710.0 million, $3,385.0 million after-tax. The following table summarizes the impairment charges that were taken by sector during 2008: In millions Goodwill Intangible Assets Marketable Securities Total Climate Solutions $ 840.0 $ 400.0 $ - $ 1,240.0 Residential Solutions 1,656.0 454.0 - 2,110.0 Security Technologies 344.0 6.0 10.0 360.0 Total $ 2,840.0 $ 860.0 $ 10.0 $ 3,710.0 For a further discussion of impairment related matters, see Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets under Critical Accounting Policies and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Margin Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to 6.4% from a negative 19.5% for the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was impacted by a non-cash charge of $3,710.0 million related to an asset impairment recognized in the fourth quarter. Excluding the asset impairment, which had a 28.1 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating margins decreased by 2.2 points. The primary drivers of the decrease related to lower volumes, an unfavorable currency impact and lower margins in the acquired Trane businesses. Results were further impacted by $111.4 million of restructuring costs which impacted operating margins in 2009 by 0.8 points. Productivity actions, expense reduction and improved pricing helped to mitigate the impact of the continued global weakness in our major end markets. Operating margin decreased from 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007 to a negative 19.5% for the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane since the Acquisition Date. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was impacted by a non-cash charge of $3,710.0 million related to an asset impairment recognized in the fourth quarter. Excluding the asset impairment, which had a 28.1 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating margins decreased by 3.5 points. The primary drivers of the decrease related to lower volumes, higher commodity costs and an unfavorable business and product mix. Results were further impacted by restructuring and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. Productivity actions, expense reduction and improved pricing helped to mitigate the impact of the global weakness in our major end markets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $56.8 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase is primarily related to higher average debt levels as a result of the funding of the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $109.2 million compared with the same period of 2007. The increase is primarily related to significantly higher debt levels used to help fund the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. 35 Table of Contents Other, Net The year-over-year changes in Other, net primarily resulted from the following: In millions 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 13.3 $ 95.6 $ 36.2 Currency gain (loss) (36.1 ) (41.9 ) (2.8 ) Earnings from equity investments 8.1 3.4 1.0 Other 34.4 6.1 (4.2 ) Other, net $ 19.7 $ 63.2 $ 30.2 For the year ended December 31, 2009, Other, net decreased by $43.5 million compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease was primarily related to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash balances during the year. The decrease was partially offset by lower exchange losses in 2009. In addition, we recorded income of approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily related to a favorable settlement with an insurance carrier associated with a portion of our asbestos obligation. The settlement is included in other in the table above. Included in currency exchange gains (losses) above is a $24 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009, associated with the recent devaluation in the Venezuelan Bolivar. At December 31, 2009, we remeasured our foreign currency receivables and payables associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar at the parallel rate of 6.0 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar, based on our inability to settle certain transactions through the official government channels in an expeditious manner. Previously, we remeasured all foreign currency transactions at the official rate of 2.15 Bolivars for each U.S. dollar. In addition, effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated highly inflationary, as the blended Consumer Price Index/National Consumer Price Index reached cumulative three-year inflation in excess of 100% during the fourth quarter of 2009. As such, all future foreign currency fluctuations will be recorded in income. For the year ended December 31, 2008, Other, net increased by $33.0 million compared with the same period of 2007. The increase was a result of greater interest income generated by higher average cash balances prior to the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. The increase was partially offset by currency losses due to significant volatility in currency exchange rates, predominately in the fourth quarter. Provision for Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate was 12.8% compared to 7.5% in 2008. The 2009 tax rate was below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate. The 5.3 point increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of an increase in valuation allowances as well as changes in earnings mix offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the effective tax rate was 7.5%. The tax rate was substantially below the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the large impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter, as well as earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which, in aggregate, have a lower effective rate. Excluding the impairment charge, the adjusted effective rate would have been 12.4%, compared with an effective rate of 21.8% in 2007. The 9.4 point reduction in the effective rate is primarily the result of lower earnings in high tax jurisdiction during 2008. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of tax matters. Review of Business Segments In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to more closely reflect our corporate and business strategies and to promote additional productivity and growth. Our segments are now as follows: Climate Solutions, Residential Solutions, Industrial Technologies and Security Technologies. As part of the 36 Table of Contents change, we eliminated the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment which represented the acquired Trane business and created two new reportable segments, the Climate Solutions segment and the Residential Solutions segment. See Note 24 in the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the segment realignment. The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. Climate Solutions Our Climate Solutions segment delivers energy-efficient refrigeration and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) throughout the world. Encompassing the transport and stationary refrigeration markets as well as the commercial HVAC markets, this segment offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions to manage controlled temperature environments. This segment includes the market leading brands of Hussmann, Thermo King and Trane. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to eliminate the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment, which represented the Trane commercial and residential businesses acquired at the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date). As a result, the Trane commercial HVAC business is now incorporated within the newly created Climate Solutions segment, along with the transport and stationary refrigeration business. Reported results include revenue and operating income from the Trane commercial HVAC business for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date in 2008 and for the full year in 2009. Dollar amounts in millions 2009 % change 2008 % change 2007 Net revenues $ 7,293.7 8.0% $ 6,750.6 100.2% $ 3,372.4 Operating income (loss) 406.9 n/a (771.8 ) * n/a 382.6 Operating margin 5.6% -11.4% 11.3% * Amount includes a non-cash impairment charge of $1,240.0 million. 2009 vs 2008 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 8.0% or $543.1 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -13.9 % Pricing 0.5 % Currency exchange rates -1.1 % Acquisition of the Trane commercial HVAC business 22.5 % Total 8.0 % Net revenues in the Trane commercial HVAC business increased $1,522.2 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 22.5% of the segment year-over-year increase, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date. Net revenues in the transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased 29.2%, or $979.1 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease, which had a 14.5% impact on the segment year-over-year results, was primarily due to lower volumes and product mix (14%) and an unfavorable currency impact (1%). These reductions were slightly offset by improved pricing (1%). Trane commercial HVAC revenues were impacted by a continued decline in activity in non-residential construction markets in all major geographic areas, except Asia. Both equipment and service revenue, as well as parts, services and solutions were impacted by the decrease in end market activity. Net revenues in our transport 37 Table of Contents and stationary refrigeration businesses decreased primarily as a result of the continued decline in the heavy truck market in Europe. However, improved activity in the U.S. and Asian refrigerated trailer and truck markets during the fourth quarter helped to mitigate the declines in Europe. In addition, sea-going container revenues and worldwide bus revenues have begun to improve in the fourth quarter due to an increase in end market activity. Worldwide display cases and contracting revenue were impacted by continued slower supermarket capital expenditures in both the U.S. and Europe. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $1,178.7 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result of a non-cash charge of $1,240.0 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Excluding the impairment, which had an 18.3 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating income decreased 13.1% or $61.3 million. Excluding the asset impairment charge of $1,200.0 million in 2008, operating income in the Trane commercial HVAC business increased $101.7 million compared with the same period in 2008, which only included the results of Trane for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date. This increase had a 21.7% impact to segment operating income. However, operating results for the year were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in volumes and pricing, partially offset by increased productivity and improved material costs. Included in 2009 operating income within the Trane commercial HVAC business was $97.3 million of ongoing purchase accounting charges primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. In addition, we recorded $26.1 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. These costs had a combined 1.7 point impact on the segment 2009 operating margins. 2008 comparable amounts were $48.1 million related to ongoing purchase accounting costs and $14.6 million related to severance and other business integration costs. In addition, 2008 operating income included $147.4 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to backlog, inventory and in-process research and development costs. These costs had a combined 3.1 point impact on the segment 2008 operating margins. Operating income in our transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased by 51.1%, or $163.0 million, compared with the same period of 2008, excluding the $40.0 million asset impairment charge in 2008. This decrease, which had a 34.8% impact on segment operating income, resulted from lower volumes and product mix ($313 million) and an unfavorable currency impact. This decrease was partially offset by increased productivity ($127 million) and improved pricing ($34 million). In addition, we recorded $11.6 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. 2008 vs 2007 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 100.2% or $3,378.2 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The dramatic year-over-year increase was a result of the inclusion of the Trane commercial HVAC business since the Acquisition Date in 2008 operating results, which totaled $3,393.8 million for the period. Excluding the results of Trane, net revenues decreased by 0.5% or $15.6 million, compared with the same period in 2007. The slight decrease in the year-over-year results were primarily due to lower volumes (4%) offset by a favorable currency impact (3%) and improved pricing. Net revenues for the Trane commercial HVAC businesses decreased in both domestic and international markets. Increased revenues for parts, services and solutions were more than offset by a decline in equipment revenue. Net revenues for our transport and stationary refrigeration business decreased primarily as a result of the decline in the truck market, which decreased refrigerated trailer and truck revenues in North America and Europe. In addition, sea-going container revenues, as well as bus and aftermarket revenues also decreased as a result of slower end market activity. Worldwide display cases and contracting revenue decreased due to declines in display case sales to regional supermarkets in the U.S. and a sharp decline in the installation business. However, sales of the TriPac auxiliary unit continued to experience substantial growth in 2008. 38 Table of Contents Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $1,154.4 million compared to the same period of 2007. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a non-cash charge of $1,240.0 million related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets within the segment. The charge had an 18.3 point impact on operating margins in 2008. Excluding the asset impairment, the Trane commercial HVAC business added $149.3 million of operating income to the segment since the Acquisition Date. Included within operating income is $147.4 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to inventory step-up, backlog amortization and in-process research and development costs. In addition, ongoing purchase accounting charges, primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets, were $48.1 million. Other significant charges associated with the acquisition were $14.6 million and were primarily related to severance and other business integration costs. These costs had a combined 3.1 point impact on the segment operating margins in 2008. Excluding the asset impairment, operating income in our transport and stationary refrigeration business for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by 16.6% or $63.7 million, compared to the same period in 2007. During 2008, we recorded $38.6 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. Other factors contributing to the year-over-year decrease were lower volumes and product mix ($73 million) and increased material costs ($46 million), partially offset by increased productivity ($51 million), improved pricing ($44 million) and a favorable currency impact. Residential Solutions Our Residential Solutions segment provides safety, comfort and efficiency to homeowners throughout North America and parts of South America. It offers customers a broad range of products, services and solutions including mechanical and electronic locks, energy-efficient HVAC systems, indoor air quality solutions, advanced controls, portable security systems and remote home management. This segment is comprised of well-known brands like American Standard, Schlage and Trane. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to eliminate the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment, which represented the Trane commercial and residential businesses acquired at the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date). As a result, the Trane residential HVAC business is now incorporated within the newly created Residential Solutions segment, along with our residential security business. Reported results include revenue and operating income from the Trane residential HVAC business for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date in 2008 and for the full year in 2009. Dollar amounts in millions 2009 % change 2008 % change 2007 Net revenues $ 2,001.5 35.8% $ 1,473.7 180.3% $ 525.7 Operating income (loss) 122.9 n/a (2,037.0 ) * n/a 44.9 Operating margin 6.1% -138.2% 8.5% * Amount includes a non-cash impairment charge of $2,110.0 million. 2009 vs. 2008 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 35.8% or $527.8 million, compared with the same period of 2008, which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix -3.8 % Pricing 0.6 % Acquisition of Trane residential HVAC business 39.0 % Total 35.8 % 39 Table of Contents Net revenues in the Trane residential HVAC business increased $574.1 million compared with the same period of 2008. The increase, which represented 39.0% of the segment year-over-year increase, was a consequence of 2008 reported results only reflecting activity since the Acquisition Date. Net revenues for the Trane residential HVAC business for the year ended December 31, 2009 were impacted by lower volumes and reduced pricing. Net revenues in the residential security business decreased by 9.9%, or $46.3 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The decrease, which had a 3.2% impact on the segment year-over-year results, was primarily due to lower volumes and product mix (4%). These reductions were slightly offset by improved pricing (1%). Trane residential HVAC revenues were impacted by continued weakness in the U.S. housing market. However, improved fourth quarter sales to the replacement market helped to mitigate the slower end market activity. Residential security revenues were impacted by lower same store sales at large customers and ongoing weakness in the new homebuilder channel. In the fourth quarter, these declines were more than offset by new product revenues and market share gains. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $2,159.9 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result of a non-cash charge of $2,110.0 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets within the Trane residential HVAC business. Excluding the impairment, which had a 143.2 point impact on 2008 operating margins, year-over-year operating income increased by 68.4% or $49.9 million. Excluding the asset impairment charge in 2008, operating income in the Trane residential HVAC business increased $43.1 million compared with the same period in 2008, which included the results of Trane for the six months and 25 days since the Acquisition Date. This increase had a 59.0% impact to segment operating income, excluding impairment. However, operating results for the year were impacted by a reduction in volumes and pricing, offset by increased productivity and improved material costs. Included in 2009 operating income for the Trane residential HVAC business was $80.6 million of ongoing purchase accounting charges primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. In addition, we recorded $7.5 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. These costs had a combined 4.4 point impact on the segment 2009 operating margins. 2008 comparable amounts were $33.0 million related to ongoing purchase accounting costs and $5.6 million related to severance and other business integration costs. In addition, 2008 operating income included $11.0 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to backlog, inventory and in-process research and development costs. These costs had a combined 3.3 point impact on the segment 2008 operating margins. Operating income in our residential security business increased by 11.7%, or $6.8 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase, which had a 9.3% impact on segment operating income, resulted from increased productivity ($18 million) and improved pricing ($10 million). This increase was partially offset by lower volumes and product mix ($16 million). In addition, we recorded $1.4 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. 2008 vs. 2007 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 180.3% or $948.0 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The dramatic year-over-year increase was a result of the inclusion of the Trane residential HVAC business since the Acquisition Date, which totaled $1,007.5 million for the period. Excluding the results of Trane, net revenues decreased by 11.3% or $59.5 million, compared with the same period in 2007. The decrease in year-over-year results were primarily due to lower volumes (22%) offset by improved pricing (10%). Net revenues for the Trane residential HVAC businesses decreased in all markets. In addition, net revenues for our residential security business decreased primarily due to lower volume as a result of lower same store sales at large customers and ongoing weakness in the new homebuilder channel. 40 Table of Contents Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $2,081.9 million, compared to the same period of 2007. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a non-cash charge of $2,110.0 million related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets within the Trane residential HVAC business. Excluding the asset impairment charge, which had a 143.2 point impact on operating margins in 2008, year-over-year operating income increased by 62.6% or $28.1 million. Excluding the asset impairment, the Trane residential HVAC business added $15.0 million of operating income to the segment since the Acquisition Date in 2008. This increase contributed 33.4% to the year-over-year increase in overall operating income. Included within operating income is $11.0 million in non-recurring purchase accounting charges associated with the fair value allocation of purchase price to inventory step-up, backlog amortization and in-process research and development costs. In addition, ongoing purchase accounting charges, primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets, were $33.0 million. Other significant charges associated with the acquisition were $5.6 million and were primarily related to severance and other business integration costs. These costs had a combined 3.3 point impact on the segment operating margins in 2008. Operating income in our residential security business for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 29.2% or $13.1 million, compared to the same period in 2007. Factors contributing to the year-over-year increase were improved pricing ($51 million) and increased productivity ($16 million) partially offset by lower volumes and product mix ($53 million). In addition, we recorded $6.3 million of restructuring charges in 2008 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announce restructuring plans. Industrial Technologies Our Industrial Technologies segment provides products, services and solutions that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It offers our global customers a diverse and innovative range of products including compressed air systems, tools, pumps, fluid handling systems, golf and utility vehicles in addition to environmentally friendly micro turbines. This segment includes the Club Car and Ingersoll Rand market leading brands. Dollar amounts in millions 2009 % change 2008 % change 2007 Net revenues $ 2,181.0 -25.8% $ 2,938.3 2.1% $ 2,877.1 Operating income 171.8 -51.4% 353.7 -9.8% 392.0 Operating margin 7.9% 12.0% 13.6% 2009 vs 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, net revenues decreased by 25.8% or $757.3 million, compared with the same period of 2008. The primary drivers of the year-over-year decrease were lower volumes and product mix (25%) and an unfavorable currency impact (2%). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing (1%). Revenues in the Air and Productivity Solutions business declined in all geographic areas. The decrease in the U.S. was a result of volume declines in major industrial, process and fluid handling end markets as well as lower aftermarket results. Non-U.S. revenues were also impacted by volume declines in industrial activity. Club Car revenues sharply decreased in all geographic areas due to weakening economic fundamentals in key golf, hospitality and recreation markets. In addition, the decline was impacted by customers deferring golf car replacement by extending their leases. Market share gains and growth in low-speed vehicle sales at Club Car helped to offset some of the slow end market activity. Operating income decreased by 51.4% or $181.9 million during 2009. During 2009, we recorded $27.1 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination benefits and other cost associated with announced restructuring plans, which had a 1.2 point impact on operating margins. The remaining decrease was primarily related to lower volumes and product mix ($263 million), an unfavorable currency impact ($20 million) and higher material costs ($17 million). These reductions were partially offset by increased productivity ($123 million) and improved pricing ($16 million). 41 Table of Contents 2008 vs 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, net revenues increased by 2.1% or $61.2 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The primary drivers of the year-over-year increase were improved pricing (2%), acquisitions (2%) and a favorable currency impact (1%). The improved results were partially offset by lower volumes and product mix (3%). The increase in segment revenue was driven by the worldwide increase in the Air and Productivity Solutions business. However, lower volumes in all geographic areas in the second half of the year show the weakening industrial and fluid handling end markets. In addition, slower industrial production levels as well as the deferral of some maintenance by customers more than offset aftermarket growth. Club Car revenues declined in all geographic areas compared with 2007 mainly due to weak economic fundamentals in key golf, hospitality and recreation markets. However, the business continued to gain market share in the declining golf market and a softening utility vehicle market. Operating income decreased by 9.8% or $38.3 million during 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded $9.6 million of restructuring charges associated with employee termination benefits and other cost associated with announced restructuring plans, which had a 0.4 point impact on operating margins. The remaining decrease was primarily related to higher material costs ($61 million), lower volumes and product mix ($42 million) and increased spending on new product development ($15 million). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing ($62 million) and increased productivity ($46 million). Security Technologies Our Security Technologies segment is a leading global provider of products and services that make environments safe, secure and productive. The segment market-leading solutions include electronic and biometric access control systems and software, locks and locksets, door closers, exit devices, steel doors and frames as well as time, attendance and personnel scheduling systems. These products serve a wide range of markets including the commercial construction market, healthcare, retail, maritime and transport industries as well as educational and governmental facilities. This segment includes the CISA, LCN, Schlage and Von Duprin brands. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we realigned our external reporting structure to eliminate the Air Conditioning Systems and Services segment, which represented the Trane commercial and residential businesses acquired at the close of business on June 5, 2008 (the Acquisition Date). As a result, the Trane residential HVAC business is now incorporated within the newly created Residential Solutions segment, along with our residential security business. As a result, our residential security business is no longer included as a part of our Security Technologies segment, which now represents our commercial security business.

The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to lower volumes and product mix (17%) and an unfavorable currency impact (2%). These reductions were partially offset by improved pricing (2%). The decrease in net revenues was a result of the recent decline in the worldwide contracting of construction markets. Revenues were impacted by the decline in new building and remodeling markets in the United States and Europe. 42 Table of Contents Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by 663.4% or $281.3 million, compared with the same period of 2008. This increase was a result of a non-cash charge of $360.0 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and marketable securities within the segment. The charge had a 17.4 point impact on 2008 operating margins. Excluding the asset impairment charge, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 19.6% or $78.7 million, compared with the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily a result of lower volumes and product mix ($179 million) and an unfavorable currency impact ($14 million). These reductions were partially offset by increased productivity ($75 million), improved pricing ($46 million) and lower material costs ($15 million). We also recorded $24.5 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans. 2008 vs 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, net revenues increased by 3.9% or $76.9 million, compared with the same period of 2007. The year-over-year increase was primarily related to improved pricing (3%) and a favorable currency impact (1%). Net revenues increased slightly during the year driven by electronic solutions growth in Asia. However, declines in the North American commercial construction market and well as in Europe during the fourth quarter significantly lowered year-over-year revenues. Operating income decreased by 89.1% or $346.2 million during 2008. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a non-cash charge of $360.0 million related to the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and marketable securities within the segment. The charge had a 17.4 point impact on operating margins in 2008. Excluding the impairment charge, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 3.6% or $13.8 million, compared to the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily a result of improved pricing ($68 million) and productivity gains ($26 million), which more than offset the decrease in volume ($22 million), increased material costs ($16 million) and a negative currency impact ($7 million). We also recorded $6.8 million of restructuring charges in 2008 associated with employee termination benefits and other costs associated with announced restructuring plans.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a non-cash charge of $449.0 million ($277 million after-tax) related to our liability for all pending and estimated future asbestos claims through 2053. Refer to Note 23 in the consolidated financial statements for further details on asbestos-related matters. Liquidity and Capital Resources During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed a comprehensive financing program that significantly enhanced our liquidity and debt profile. Actions taken include the issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term debt (Senior Notes and Exchangeable Senior Notes) in April 2009 and the replacement of our Trane accounts receivable purchase program in March 2009 with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments. The proceeds from our debt issuance were used to repay the $950.0 million outstanding under our senior unsecured bridge loan facility. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated by our operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for the foreseeable future. Liquidity The following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the period ended December 31: In millions 2009 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 876.7 $ 550.2 $ 4,735.3 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt 876.7 2,350.4 741.0 Long-term debt 3,219.9 2,773.7 712.7 Total debt 4,096.6 5,124.1 1,453.7 Total Ingersoll-Rand plc shareholders equity 7,101.8 6,661.4 7,907.9 Total shareholders equity 7,205.7 6,762.1 8,005.4 Debt-to-total capital ratio 36.2% 43.1% 15.4% The large cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2007 is attributable to the sale of both the Compact Equipment and the Road Development business units during 2007, which generated proceeds of $6,154.3 million. The lower cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2008 is a result of the acquisition of Trane. 45 Table of Contents Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt consisted of the following: In millions 2009 2008 Commercial paper program $ - $ 998.7 Senior unsecured bridge loan facility - 754.0 Debentures with put feature 343.6 345.7 Current maturities of long-term debt 526.5 200.4 Other short-term borrowings 6.6 51.6 Total $ 876.7 $ 2,350.4 Commercial Paper Program We use borrowings under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings after paying down $998.7 million during 2009. We funded these payments primarily using cash generated from operations. Senior Unsecured Bridge Loan Facility In connection with the Trane acquisition, we entered into a $3.9 billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility, with a 364-day term. We drew down $2.95 billion against the bridge loan facility in June 2008. The proceeds, along with cash on hand and the issuance of $1.5 billion in commercial paper, were used to fund the cash component of the consideration paid for the acquisition as well as to pay for related fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. As of December 31, 2008, our outstanding balance of the senior unsecured bridge loan facility was $754 million after a $196 million payment in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, we borrowed an additional $196 million under the facility, increasing the outstanding balance to $950.0 million as of March 31, 2009. We repaid the outstanding balance in April 2009 with proceeds from our long-term debt issuance as discussed below and terminated the facility. Debentures with Put Feature At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding $547.9 million of fixed rate debentures which only requires early repayment at the option of the holder. These debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options are not fully exercised, the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028. In 2008, holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on $202.2 million of the debentures. As a result, approximately $345.7 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2008. In 2009, holders of these debentures chose to exercise the put feature on $2.1 million of the remaining debentures. As a result, approximately $343.6 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2009. In February 2010, holders of these debentures have the option to exercise the put feature on $37.2 million of the outstanding debentures. Based on our cash flow forecast, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts redeemable as a result of these put features. Long-Term Debt In August 2008, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance and issued $1.6 billion of long-term debt pursuant to the shelf registration statement through our wholly owned subsidiary, IR Global Holding Company Limited. This issuance consisted of $250 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due in 2010, $600 million 6.000% Senior Notes due in 2013 and $750 million 6.875% Senior Notes due in 2018. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited. The net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce the amount outstanding under the senior unsecured bridge loan facility. 46 Table of Contents Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year. We have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the debt offering documents. Interest on the floating rate notes will be paid four times a year. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. Senior Notes Due 2014 In April 2009, we issued $655 million of 9.5% Senior Notes through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global). The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the fixed rate notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. We have the option to redeem them in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2012 In April 2009, we issued $345 million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International. Interest on the exchangeable notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. In addition, holders may exchange their notes at their option prior to November 15, 2011 in accordance with specified circumstances set forth in the indenture agreement or anytime on or after November 15, 2011 through their scheduled maturity. Upon exchange, the notes will be paid in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged, the remainder due on the option feature, if any, will be paid in cash, IR ordinary shares or a combination thereof at the option of the Company. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. We allocated the proceeds of the exchangeable notes between debt and equity, in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We allocated approximately $305 million of the gross proceeds to debt, with the remaining discount of approximately $40 million (approximately $39 million after allocated fees) recorded within equity. Additionally, we will amortize the discount into earnings over a three-year period. Accounts Receivable Purchase Program On March 31, 2009, we expanded our existing Trane accounts receivable purchase program and replaced it with a new accounts receivable purchase program that encompassed originators from all four of our business segments. The increase in originators allowed us to increase the program size from $150 million to $325 million. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of eligible trade receivables sold to an affiliated master special purpose vehicle was $544.2 million. However, no net interests have been sold to any of the three conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect to terminate the new accounts receivable purchase program prior to its expiration in March 2010. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the program. Pension Plans Our investment objectives in managing defined benefit plan assets are to ensure that present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries are met as they become due; to provide a total return that, over the long-term, minimizes our required contributions at the appropriate levels of risk; and to meet any statutory or regulatory requirements. We monitor the impact of market conditions on our funding requirements and pension plan expense on a quarterly basis. None of our pension plans have experienced any significant impact on their liquidity to pay retirees in the plans due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. 47 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the consolidated financial statements. In millions 2009 2008 2007 Operating cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations $ 1,751.5 $ 374.3 $ 826.3 Investing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (182.7 ) (7,306.4 ) 6,052.4 Financing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (1,208.1 ) 2,760.6 (2,568.5 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1,751.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $374.3 million in 2008. Prior year operating cash flows were impacted by a tax payment of approximately $700 million in the first quarter of 2008 paid to various taxing authorities primarily associated with the Compact Equipment divestiture. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 include significant improvements in accounts receivable collections and inventory management, in addition to the results of Trane for the entire period. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $374.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with $826.3 million in 2007. The change was primarily related to tax payments of approximately $1.1 billion paid to various taxing authorities, $594.4 million associated with the Compact Equipment divestiture. Tax payments in 2007 were approximately $470 million. In addition, cash flows from operating activities include Trane cash flows from operations since the Acquisition Date. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $182.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $7,306.4 million in 2008. The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to cash used for the acquisition of Trane in 2008. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $7,306.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with net cash provided by continuing operations of $6,052.4 million in 2007. The change is primarily attributable to cash used for the acquisition of Trane in 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash proceeds of $6,154.3 million was received related to the sale of Compact Equipment and the Road Development business unit. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,208.1 million, compared with $2,760.6 million of net cash provided by financing activities during 2008. The change in financing activities is primarily related to the proceeds received from the bridge loan facility and commercial paper used to finance the acquisition of Trane in June 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we refinanced the bridge loan facility and repaid the amounts outstanding on our commercial paper program. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $2,760.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with $2,568.5 million of net cash used in financing activities during 2007. The change in financing activities primarily relates to the outstanding balance of both our bridge loan facility and commercial paper which were used to finance the acquisition of Trane. In addition, $1.6 billion relates to the net proceeds from our long-term debt issuance in August 2008. Furthermore, 2007 was impacted by the repurchase of $2.0 billion of our outstanding shares. 48 Table of Contents Capital Resources Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next 12 months. Capital expenditures were $204.2 million, $306.0 million and $119.7 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2010 is estimated to be approximately $250 million, including amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges. During 2007, we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts across each of our sectors. These actions include both workforce reductions as well as the consolidation of manufacturing facilities. In addition, we announced plans to initiate enterprise-wide restructuring actions in October 2008. These actions include streamlining the footprint of manufacturing facilities and reducing the general and administrative cost base. As of December 31, 2009, we have incurred approximately $182.1 million of costs associated with these restructuring actions since the fourth quarter of 2008. For financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. Capitalization In addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our commercial paper programs. Our ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the commercial paper programs is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2009, our credit ratings were as follows: Short-term Long-term Moody P-2 Baa1 Standard and Poor A-2 BBB+ The credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In June 2008, we entered into a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a three-year term. The line is unused and provides support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. In addition to the three-year credit facility, we have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1.25 billion, which expires in August 2010. This line is unused and provides support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. Other available non-U.S. lines of credit were $993.3 million, of which $823.9 million were unused at December 31, 2009. These lines provide support for bank guarantees, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. Our public debt does not contain any financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2009, our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit. Guarantees As part of the reorganization of IR-New Jersey in 2001, IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the issued public debt securities of IR-New Jersey. IR-New Jersey unconditionally guaranteed payment of the 49 Table of Contents principal, premium, if any, and interest on IR-Limited 4.75% Senior Notes due in 2015 in aggregate principal amount of $300 million. The guarantee is unsecured and provided on an unsubordinated basis. The guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt of IR-New Jersey. In addition, public debt securities issued by IR Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IR-Limited. As a part of the reorganization of IR-Limited in 2009, the guarantee structure was updated to reflect the newly created legal structure under which (i) IR-International assumed the obligations of IR-Limited as issuer or guarantor, as the case may be, and (ii) IR-Ireland and IR-Limited fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under the various indentures covering the currently outstanding public debt of IR-International, IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. Neither IR-Ireland nor IR-Limited has issued or intends to issue guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred by Trane. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods, in millions: Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years Total Short-term debt $ 6.6 $ - $ - $ - $ 6.6 Long-term debt 868.8 * 377.2 ** 1,273.2 1,610.0 4,129.2 Interest payments on long-term debt 256.9 475.4 382.1 716.2 1,830.6 Purchase obligations 847.4 7.5 3.5 - 858.4 Operating leases 169.9 242.0 138.2 123.9 674.0 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,149.6 $ 1,102.1 $ 1,797.0 $ 2,450.1 $ 7,498.8 * Includes $343.6 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. ** Includes $345 million related to the Exchangeable Senior Notes due in 2012. See Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental and asbestos matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above. Pensions At December 31, 2009, we had net obligations of $903.0 million, which consist of noncurrent pension assets of $1.1 million and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of $904.1 million. It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $85 million to our plans worldwide in 2010. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions At December 31, 2009, we had postretirement benefit obligations of $979.4 million. We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $79 million in 2010. Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Taxes At December 31, 2009, we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $525.1 million and $80.3 million of related accrued interest and penalties. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table 50 Table of Contents as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and IRS tax disputes. Environmental and Asbestos Matters We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. See Note 13 and Note 23 for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical. Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company has provided an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which represents the best estimate of probable loss inherent in the Company accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon the Company policy, derived from its knowledge of its end markets, customer base and products. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset may be less than the carrying amount of the asset. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and determined using a two step process. The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. In step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit. 51 Table of Contents Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated fair value of the respective intangible assets. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The calculation of estimated fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. The determination of estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Management developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. 2009 Impairment Test For our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11% to 15% and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2% to 5%. Under the market approach, management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, management compared the estimate aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the Company overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except one, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15%. The one reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Climate Solutions segment, exceeded its carrying value by 8%. This reporting unit has goodwill of approximately $840 million. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. 2008 Impairment Test Due to the deterioration in the worldwide equity and credit markets and a tightening of industrial and retail end markets in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company market capitalization declined well below its book value. In addition, the weakening worldwide economic conditions resulted in our projected 2009 financial performance decline. As a result, the Company updated its impairment testing through December 31, 2008. Based on the estimated fair value and book value of our reporting units, we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 of approximately $3,710.0 million ($3,385.0 million after-tax). The assumptions used represent management best estimate of fair value. Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates generally ranging from 11%-15% and terminal growth rates generally ranging from 2%-5%. Under the market approach, management used an adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, management compared the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to the Company overall market capitalization. Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying 52 Table of Contents value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. Loss contingencies Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker compensation and other claims. The Company has recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, the Company believes its estimated reserves are reasonable and does not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company for any year. Asbestos matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. The Company records a liability for its actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Although the Company was neither a manufacturer nor producer of asbestos, some of its formerly manufactured components from third party suppliers utilized asbestos related components. As a result, the Company records certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations, net of tax, as they relate to previously divested businesses. Income and expenses associated with Trane asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries are recorded within continuing operations. Refer to Note 23 in the consolidated financial statements for further details of asbestos-related matters. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. Revenue from maintenance contracts or extended warranties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs incurred. The Company enters into agreements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, fair values of undelivered elements are known, customer acceptance has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements. Revenues from certain of our equipment and the related installation sold under construction-type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, (ASC 740) which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 740 53 Table of Contents provides guidance on the recognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. The Company will adjust its estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from the original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. Employee benefit plans The Company provides a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality and turnover rates and health-care cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of the measurement date. A discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. For U.S. plans, it is established and based primarily on a study based on the Citigroup Pension Liability index. For non-U.S. plans, it is based upon a review of the current yields reported on AA corporate bonds or the yields of high-quality fixed-income investments available and expected to be available during the life of the plans. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan investment policy, the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of the measurement date. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from its actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors. Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $9.6 million and the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $6.4 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.8 million and a 1.0% increase in the health-care cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately $2.0 million. The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the Company consolidated financial statements. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company results for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between the Company estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 54 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: FASB ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits, (ASC 715) requires an entity to measure its defined benefit plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position. The measurement date provisions of ASC 715 are effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. The Company has adopted the measurement provisions of ASC 715, which resulted in an after-tax charge to Retained earnings in the amount of $3.7 million ($6.5 million pre-tax) in 2008. Plans acquired during 2008 were not impacted by this change. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, (ASC 740) which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a result of adopting these provisions of ASC 740 as of January 1, 2007, the Company recorded additional liabilities to its previously established reserves, and corresponding decrease in Retained earnings of $145.6 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820) to provide a framework for measuring fair value that is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information to develop those assumptions. Additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures about fair value measurements to include disclosing the fair value measurements of assets or liabilities within each level of the fair value hierarchy. These provisions of ASC 820 were effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has delayed its implementation of these provisions for the fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and nonfinancial long-lived assets and liabilities. Refer to Note 16 in the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of these provisions of ASC 820. In February 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825) which allows companies the option, at specified election dates, to measure financial assets and liabilities at their current fair value, with the corresponding changes in fair value from period to period recognized in the income statement. Additionally, ASC 825 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities. These provisions of ASC 825 are effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has not elected this option available under ASC 825. In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance to address the financial accounting and reporting for business combinations, which can be found in FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). ASC 805 supersedes SFAS 141, Business Combinations and retains the fundamental requirements set forth therein regarding the purchase method of accounting. However, it expands the guidance to enable proper recognition and measurement, at fair value, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business. In addition, ASC 805 introduces new accounting guidance on how to recognize and measure contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition and restructuring costs. These provisions of ASC 805 are effective for acquisitions occurring after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 810, Consolidations (ASC 810) which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary represents an ownership interest that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, ASC 810 requires expanded income statement presentation and disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the Company and the interests of the non-controlling owners of the subsidiary. ASC 810, as it relates to noncontrolling interests, is effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2009. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on these provisions of ASC 810. In March 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) which amends and expands the disclosures previously required. ASC 815 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains 55 Table of Contents and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The expanded disclosure requirements found in ASC 815 as they relate to the modifications made in March 2008 are effective for the Company starting on January 1, 2009. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these provisions of ASC 815. In May 2008, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 470, Debt (ASC 470) which requires us to allocate between debt and equity the proceeds of the Company exchangeable notes, in a manner that reflects the Company nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. In addition, the Company is required to amortize any discount into earnings over a period of three years. These provisions of ASC 470 became applicable to the Company during the second quarter of 2009, upon issuance of the exchangeable senior notes in April 2009. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance within ASC 810. These revisions eliminate FASB Interpretation 46(R) exceptions to consolidating qualifying special-purpose entities, contain new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary, and increase the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. ASC 810 also contains a new requirement that any term, transaction, or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity status as a variable interest entity, a company power over a variable interest entity, or a company obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying FASB Interpretation 46(R) provisions. The elimination of the qualifying special-purpose entity concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments. These provisions of ASC 810 are effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first period, with earlier adoption prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if any, on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance within FASB ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing (ASC 860). These revisions eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, create more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarify other sale- accounting criteria, and change the initial measurement of a transferor interest in transferred financial assets. These provisions of ASC 860 will be effective for transfers of financial assets in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009 and in interim periods within those fiscal years with earlier adoption prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.
