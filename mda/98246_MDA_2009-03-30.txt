Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to the fiscal year that ends on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark. Management intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the TIFFANY & CO. brand, but believes that there are a significant number of locations remaining worldwide that meet the requirements of a TIFFANY & CO. location. To increase store productivity. Over the years, the Company has opened smaller size stores which have contributed to higher store productivity. In addition, the Company is focused on growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and the conversion rate (the percentage of shoppers who actually purchase) through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer-focused initiatives. To achieve improved operating margins. Management long-term objective is to improve gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) through greater product manufacturing/sourcing efficiencies (including increased direct rough-diamond sourcing and internal manufacturing) and increased use of distribution center capacity. Management also intends to improve the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales by controlling expenses and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. To enhance customer awareness. The TIFFANY & CO. brand (the Brand ) is the single most important asset of the Company and is inherent in consumer aspirations for the Brand. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase customer awareness of the Brand and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new collections and add new and innovative products to existing lines. To increase its control over product supply through greater direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and/or polish rough diamonds for use in Company merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. TIFFANY & CO. K - 26 Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and maintaining ongoing training programs. 2008 SUMMARY Net sales decreased 3% to $2,859,997,000 for the year ended January 31, 2009. Sales in most markets were affected by the global economic downturn, especially during the fourth quarter. Worldwide comparable store sales decreased 9% on a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures below). For the full year, comparable TIFFANY & CO. store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis decreased 14% in the Americas, decreased 4% in Asia-Pacific due to a decline in Japan comparable store sales, and increased 6% in Europe due to growth in most countries. However, comparable store sales slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, declining 31% in the Americas and 13% in Asia-Pacific, while Europe was equal to the prior year. The Company opened 22 TIFFANY & CO. retail locations, net of closings, which increased its worldwide store base by 12% and by 9% on a square foot basis. Net earnings were $220,022,000, or 32% lower than the prior year, and net earnings per diluted share were $1.74, or 26% lower than the prior year. Included in net earnings were the following items: A pre-tax charge of $97,839,000, or $0.46 per diluted share after tax, resulting from staffing reductions; A $12,373,000 pre-tax impairment charge, or $0.07 per diluted share after tax, for an investment in Target Resources plc, a mining and exploration company; A pre-tax charge of $7,549,000, or $0.04 per diluted share after tax, due to inventory and other charges related to the anticipated closing of the Company IRIDESSE stores; and A $3,382,000 pre-tax charge, or $0.02 per diluted share after tax, for the closing of a diamond polishing facility in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The Company secured additional financing in order to refinance certain maturing debt as well as to provide for the Company long-term working capital needs. The Company repurchased 5.4 million shares of its Common Stock. The Company suspended share repurchases during the third quarter of 2008 in order to conserve cash. In May 2008, the Company Board of Directors approved a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate TIFFANY & CO. K - 27 measurement provides a more representative assessment of the sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2008 2007 Constant- Constant- GAAP Translation Exchange GAAP Translation Exchange- Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide (3 )% 1 % (4 )% 15 % 2 % 13 % Americas (10 )% (10 )% 12 % 1 % 11 % U.S. (11 )% (11 )% 10 % 10 % Asia-Pacific 8 % 7 % 1 % 14 % 2 % 12 % Japan 7 % 14 % (7 )% 1 % 1 % Other Asia-Pacific 10 % (2 )% 12 % 38 % 4 % 34 % Europe 17 % (8 )% 25 % 31 % 9 % 22 % Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide (7 )% 2 % (9 )% 8 % 1 % 7 % Americas (14 )% (14 )% 8 % 8 % U.S. (16 )% (16 )% 7 % 7 % Asia-Pacific 4 % 8 % (4 )% 7 % 2 % 5 % Japan 4 % 14 % (10 )% (4 )% 1 % (5 )% Other Asia-Pacific 3 % (2 )% 5 % 31 % 5 % 26 % Europe 1 % (5 )% 6 % 22 % 9 % 13 % TIFFANY & CO. K - 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In the first quarter of 2008, the Company changed its method of accounting for inventories held by its U.S. subsidiaries and foreign branches from the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method to the average cost method. The average cost method is now used worldwide by the Company. All prior periods have been revised. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Certain operating data as a percentage of net sales were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 42.5 43.6 42.5 Gross profit 57.5 56.4 57.5 Other operating income 3.5 Restructuring charges 3.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 41.0 41.0 39.5 Earnings from continuing operations 13.1 18.9 18.0 Interest expense, financing costs and other income, net 1.0 0.2 0.4 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 12.1 18.7 17.6 Provision for income taxes 4.4 6.8 6.4 Net earnings from continuing operations 7.7 11.9 11.2 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (0.9 ) (0.5 ) Net earnings 7.7 % 11.0 % 10.7 % Net Sales Effective with the first quarter of 2008, management has changed segment reporting to reflect operating results for the following regions: the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note A. Nature of Business ). Net sales were as follows: 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 % Change % Change Americas $ 1,586,636 $ 1,759,868 $ 1,577,744 (10 )% 12% Asia-Pacific 921,988 853,759 748,004 8 % 14% Europe 284,630 243,579 185,398 17 % 31% Other 66,743 81,565 49,588 (18 )% 64% $ 2,859,997 $ 2,938,771 $ 2,560,734 (3 )% 15% Comparable Store Sales. Reference will be made to comparable store sales below. Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in company-operated stores and boutiques. A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan (included in the Asia-Pacific segment), sales for a new store or boutique are not included if the store or boutique was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing TIFFANY & CO. K - 29 location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. Americas. The Americas segment includes sales transacted in TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.S., Canada and Latin/South America, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain of those markets through business-to-business, Internet, catalog and wholesale operations. The following table presents the Americas and its components as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2008 2007 2006 United States New York Flagship store 10 % 10 % 10 % Branch stores 35 % 38 % 40 % Internet and catalog 5 % 6 % 7 % Business-to-business 1 % 2 % 2 % Total United States 51 % 56 % 59 % Canada and Latin/South America 4 % 4 % 3 % 55 % 60 % 62 % Total sales in the Americas decreased $173,232,000, or 10%, in 2008 due to a decline in the number of units sold. This decrease included a 16%, or $220,999,000, decline in U.S. comparable store sales, partly offset by $58,065,000 of sales in U.S. non-comparable stores. The U.S. comparable store sales decline consisted of a 9% decrease in New York Flagship store sales and a 16% decline in comparable branch store sales. During the year, especially in the first half, the New York Flagship store benefited from increased sales to foreign tourists. In 2008, the Company opened six stores in the Americas. Internet and catalog sales in the U.S. decreased $18,655,000, or 10%, in 2008 due to a decrease in the number of orders shipped. Total sales in the Americas increased $182,124,000, or 12%, in 2007 equally due to an increase in the average sales amount per unit and in the number of units sold. This increase included a 7%, or $94,451,000, sales increase in comparable U.S. retail stores and $51,478,000 of non-comparable U.S. stores. The U.S. comparable store sales increase in 2007 consisted of a 21% increase in New York Flagship store sales and a 4% increase in comparable branch store sales. In 2007, the Company opened eight stores and closed one in the Americas. Internet and catalog sales in the U.S. increased $8,049,000, or 5%, in 2007 due to an increase in the number of orders shipped. Asia-Pacific. The Asia-Pacific segment includes sales transacted in TIFFANY & CO. stores in that region, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. The following table presents Asia-Pacific and its components as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2008 2007 2006 Japan 19 % 17 % 19 % Other Asia-Pacific 13 % 12 % 10 % 32 % 29 % 29 % Total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $68,229,000, or 8%, in 2008 due to an increase in the average sales amount per unit. This increase included comparable store sales growth of 4%, or $28,485,000, and non-comparable store sales of $33,178,000. On a constant-exchange-rate TIFFANY & CO. K - 30 basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 1% in 2008, while comparable store sales decreased 4% due to a 10% decline in Japan partly offset by a 5% increase in other countries. In 2008, the Company opened 10 stores and closed one in Asia-Pacific. Total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $105,755,000, or 14%, in 2007 due to an increase in the average sales amount per unit. This increase included comparable store sales growth of 7%, or $45,221,000, and non-comparable store sales of $50,633,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 12% in 2007 and comparable store sales increased 5% due to a 26% increase in countries other than Japan, partly offset by a 5% decline in Japan. In 2007, the Company opened 10 stores and closed three in Asia-Pacific. Europe. The Europe segment includes sales transacted in TIFFANY & CO. stores in that region, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. Europe represented 10%, 8% and 7% of worldwide net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006. The United Kingdom represents approximately half of European sales. Total sales in Europe increased $41,051,000, or 17%, in 2008 due to an increase in the number of units sold. This increase included non-comparable store sales of $34,910,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 25% in 2008 and comparable store sales rose by 6%, reflecting growth in the United Kingdom and most Continental European markets. In 2008, the Company opened seven stores in Europe. Total sales in Europe in 2007 increased $58,181,000, or 31%, due to an increase in the number of units sold. This increase included comparable store sales growth of 22%, or $32,634,000, and non-comparable store sales of $13,542,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 22% in 2007 and comparable store sales rose 13%, reflecting strong growth in all markets. In 2007, the Company opened three stores in Europe. Other. Other includes all non-reportable segments. Sales in Other consist primarily of wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Company needs. In addition, Other includes worldwide sales made by businesses operated under trademarks or trade names other than TIFFANY & CO., such as IRIDESSE, and earnings received from third-party licensing agreements. In January 2009, management committed to a plan to close IRIDESSE stores as agreements are reached with landlords and as inventory is sold (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Dispositions ). Other sales declined $14,822,000, or 18%, in 2008 and increased $31,977,000, or 64%, in 2007. The decrease in sales in 2008 was attributed to lower wholesale sales of diamonds that were deemed not suitable for the Company needs, while the converse occurred in 2007. Wholesale diamond sales were $54,083,000 in 2008, $70,407,000 in 2007 and $39,848,000 in 2006. Store Data. Gross square footage of Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores increased 9% to 935,000 in 2008, following a 9% increase to 860,000 in 2007. Sales per gross square foot generated by those stores were $2,603 in 2008, $2,890 in 2007 and $2,746 in 2006. Gross Margin Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) improved 1.1 percentage points in 2008 and declined 1.1 percentage points in 2007. The primary components of the net increase in 2008 were: (i) a 0.7 percentage point improvement due to a $19,212,000 pre-tax charge in the prior year related to management decision to discontinue certain watch models; (ii) a 0.3 percentage point improvement due to decreased low-margin wholesale sales of diamonds; and (iii) the benefit from the Company precious metals hedging program. The primary components of the net decline in TIFFANY & CO. K - 31 2007 were: (i) a 0.7 percentage point decline due to the previously-mentioned charge to discontinue certain watch models; (ii) a 0.6 percentage point decline due to increased low-margin wholesale sales of diamonds; which was partially offset by (iii) a 0.2 percentage point improvement due to the leverage effect of fixed product-related costs, which includes costs associated with merchandising and distribution. The Company adjusts its retail prices from time to time to address specific market conditions, product cost increases and longer-term changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Among the market conditions that the Company addresses is consumer demand for the product category involved. Consumer demand is influenced by consumer confidence and competitive pricing conditions. Management has made no determination to reduce or increase prices across all merchandise categories or across the jewelry category, but will continue to address product pricing on a case-by-case basis, as it did in 2008 when it reduced prices on diamond engagement rings in the U.S. The Company uses a limited number of derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note J. Financial Instruments ). Other Operating Income In 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. The Company secured a long-term lease and is leasing back the portion of the property that it occupied immediately prior to the transaction. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $105,051,000 and a deferred gain of $75,244,000, which will be amortized in selling, general and administrative expenses over a 15-year period. The pre-tax gain represents the profit on the sale of the property in excess of the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease. The lease expires in 2032; however, the Company has options to terminate the lease in 2022 and 2027 without penalty. Restructuring Charges To address the continuing economic downturn, the Company has implemented various cost reduction initiatives, one of which was a reduction of approximately 10% of the Company total employee base, primarily in the U.S. The Company believes these reductions more closely align staffing with anticipated sales levels. Associated with this reduction, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $97,839,000. This charge included $63,005,000 related to pension and postretirement medical benefits, $33,166,000 related to severance costs and $1,668,000 primarily related to stock-based compensation. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note D. Restructuring Charges. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses SG&A expenses decreased $32,398,000, or 3%, in 2008 and increased $194,236,000, or 19%, in 2007. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to several nonrecurring charges recorded in those periods. SG&A expenses in 2008 included the following nonrecurring items: $11,062,000 impairment charge on the investment in Target Resources plc (see Liquidity and Capital Resources below); TIFFANY & CO. K - 32 $3,382,000 charge for the closing of a diamond polishing facility in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Dispositions ); and $1,249,000 charge primarily related to severance costs associated with the closing of IRIDESSE (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Dispositions ). SG&A expenses in 2007 included the following nonrecurring items: $47,981,000 impairment charge on the note receivable from Tahera Diamond Corporation ( Tahera ) (see Liquidity and Capital Resources below); $15,532,000 impairment charge for losses in the IRIDESSE business as a result of lower-than-expected store performance and a related reduction in future cash flow projections; and $10,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, a private charitable foundation established by the Company. The contribution was made from proceeds received from the sale-leaseback of the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. Excluding the nonrecurring charges noted above, SG&A expenses in 2008 and 2007 would have been $1,156,899,000 and $1,131,477,000. This increase of $25,422,000, or 2%, was primarily due to increased depreciation and occupancy expenses of $22,792,000 and labor and benefits costs of $19,020,000, both of which were largely due to new and existing stores, and marketing expenses of $15,477,000, partly offset by a $37,645,000 decrease in management incentive and stock-based compensation. Excluding the nonrecurring charges noted above, SG&A expenses increased $120,723,000, or 12%, in 2007 primarily due to increased labor and benefit costs of $42,136,000 and increased depreciation and store occupancy expenses of $37,805,000, both of which were largely due to new and existing stores, as well as an increase of $12,287,000 in marketing expenses. The Company SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) represent approximately one-fifth of total SG&A expenses. TIFFANY & CO.

Earnings from continuing operations decreased 33% in 2008. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 2.4 percentage points. While there was a decline in SG&A expenses tied to reduced management incentive compensation, overall profitability declined due to the sales shortfall; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 1.2 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin due to a shift in product sales mix and increased operating expenses related to new store openings; Europe the ratio decreased 3.0 percentage points primarily due to increased operating expenses related to new store openings; and Other the ratio improved 3.2 percentage points. 2008 results include a $7,549,000 pre-tax charge related to the Company plans to close IRIDESSE; see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Dispositions for further details. 2007 results include the $15,532,000 impairment charge associated with the IRIDESSE business. See Selling, General and Administrative Expenses above for further details. Excluding the charges noted, total losses, primarily associated with the IRIDESSE business, in 2008 approximated losses in 2007. Earnings from continuing operations rose 21% in 2007. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 0.7 percentage point primarily due to the leverage effect of sales growth on operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 1.7 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin in Japan due to changes in product sales mix; TIFFANY & CO. K - 34 Europe the ratio increased 6.4 percentage points primarily due to the leverage effect of sales growth on operating expenses and a change in product sales mix; and Other the loss ratio increased 11.5 percentage points, which was more than entirely driven by the previously-mentioned impairment charge associated with the IRIDESSE business. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for information technology, finance, legal and human resources. Unallocated corporate expenses in 2007 include a $10,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation. Restructuring charges represents a $97,839,000 pre-tax charge associated with the Company staffing reduction initiatives. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note D. Restructuring Charges for further information. Other operating income in 2007 represents the $105,051,000 pre-tax gain on the sale-leaseback of the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. Other operating expenses in 2008 represent a pre-tax impairment charge related to the Company investment in Target Resources plc. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further details. Other operating expenses in 2007 include the $47,981,000 impairment charge on the note receivable from Tahera (see Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further information) and the $19,212,000 pre-tax charge related to management decision to discontinue certain watch models (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note F. Inventories for further details). Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense increased $4,267,000 in 2008 primarily due to increased borrowings. Interest expense decreased $1,345,000 in 2007 primarily due to reduced borrowings under the revolving credit facility and repayments of long-term debt obligations. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions, and minority interest income/expense. Other income, net decreased $16,516,000 in 2008 primarily due to (i) a $5,673,000 change in foreign currency gains/losses associated with the settlement of foreign payables, (ii) a $4,300,000 charge related to the unrealized gains and interest receivable associated with interest rate swaps that the Company determined were impaired (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note J. Financial Instruments ) and (iii) a decline in interest income. Other income, net increased $1,012,000 in 2007. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 36.4% in 2008, compared with 36.1% in 2007 and 36.3% in 2006. TIFFANY & CO. K - 35 Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The Company sold Little Switzerland, Inc. in 2007 and recorded in discontinued operations a $54,260,000 pre-tax impairment charge ($22,602,000 after tax) due to the sale. The loss from discontinued operations in 2006 included a pre-tax charge of $6,893,000 related to the impairment of goodwill for the Little Switzerland business as a result of store performance and cash flow projections. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Dispositions. 2009 Outlook The turmoil in the current retail environment has made it more difficult to predict with certainty when the global economy will stabilize and recover or when consumer sentiment with respect to jewelry purchases will improve. In order to plan the Company expenditures, management financial performance objectives are based on the following assumptions, which may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with Item 1A. Risk Factors on page K-16: A net sales decline of approximately 11% composed of (i) a mid-teens percentage decrease in the Americas (greater in the first half of the year); (ii) a mid single-digit percentage decrease in Asia-Pacific; (iii) a high single-digit percentage decrease in Europe; and (iv) a 20% decrease in Other sales. o The Company worldwide expansion strategy is to continue to open Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores and boutiques annually. The Company has moderated the rate of anticipated store openings in 2009 to five in the Americas, seven in Asia-Pacific and one in Europe. A decline in operating margin compared against the prior year (when excluding the nonrecurring items in 2008 listed in the notes to Item 6. Selected Financial Data) based upon an expected decline in gross margin and an increase in the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales. o This forecast includes (i) savings of $60,000,000 resulting from the staff reduction initiatives taken at the end of 2008; (ii) reduced marketing spending; and (iii) variable and other fixed cost savings. Other expenses, net of approximately $50,000,000, which represents an increase from the prior year due to higher interest expense as a result of recent debt issuances. An effective tax rate of 37%. Net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share of $1.50 $1.60. Net inventories declining by a single-digit percentage. Capital expenditures of $100,000,000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The global credit and equity markets have also undergone significant disruption, making it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on favorable terms. To that end, the Company has taken steps to address these new challenges. First, as noted in the 2009 Outlook section above, the Company has implemented cost reduction initiatives to better align the Company expenses with TIFFANY & CO. K - 36 the expected sales decline. Secondly, the Company secured $350,000,000 of long-term debt, which included $250,000,000 entered into in February 2009 (see Recent Borrowings and Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments below) to: (i) refinance debt obligations that have come due or are expected to mature over the next year; (ii) use the funds for general corporate purposes; and (iii) provide for financial flexibility in the event that disruptions in the economy or credit markets continue or worsen. The Company is party to a multibank, multicurrency, committed $450,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ), and has the option to increase the committed amount to $500,000,000. The Credit Facility is intended for working capital and other corporate purposes. There was $140,834,000 outstanding under the Credit Facility at January 31, 2009. The Credit Facility expires in July 2010 and the Company intends to renew the facility. Management believes that the additional sources of funding that the Company recently secured, cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows and the funds available under its revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to support the Company planned worldwide business expansion, debt service, capital expenditures, working capital needs and dividends for the foreseeable future. Based on the Company business plan for 2009, management expects the Company to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures) in excess of $400,000,000. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 133,224 $ 391,395 $ 239,036 Investing activities (161,690 ) 335,170 (197,137 ) Financing activities (39,708 ) (664,408 ) (248,871 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (18,035 ) 15,610 3,162 Net cash used in discontinued operations (7,616 ) (13,296 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (86,209 ) $ 70,151 $ (217,106 ) Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $133,224,000 in 2008, $391,395,000 in 2007 and $239,036,000 in 2006. The decrease in 2008 from 2007 primarily resulted from increased income tax payments largely associated with the sale-leasebacks of TIFFANY & CO. stores in Tokyo Ginza shopping district and on London Old Bond Street and increased inventory purchases. The increase in 2007 from 2006 primarily resulted from increased net earnings from continuing operations and smaller growth in inventories. Taxes payable also increased in 2007 due to the increase in net earnings. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $1,446,812,000 and 3.4 at January 31, 2009, compared with $1,337,454,000 and 3.3 at January 31, 2008. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2009 were 15% lower than at January 31, 2008 primarily due to a decline in sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an TIFFANY & CO. K - 37 insignificant effect on the change in accounts receivable. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 17 times in 2008 and 18 times in 2007. Inventories, net at January 31, 2009 were 17% above January 31, 2008 reflecting weaker sales trends particularly in the fourth quarter. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories increased 13% which also reflected expanded diamond sourcing operations, as well as higher gemstone costs. Finished goods inventories increased 18% which also reflected store openings, increased product costs and broadened product assortments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant effect on the change in inventories, net. Investing Activities The Company had a net cash outflow from investing activities of $161,690,000 in 2008, a net cash inflow of $335,170,000 in 2007 and a net cash outflow of $197,137,000 in 2006. Investing activities in 2007 included proceeds from the sale of assets. Proceeds from Sale of Assets. In 2007, the Company received total proceeds of $509,035,000 which consisted of the following transactions: A sale-leaseback arrangement for the land and multi-tenant building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. The Company received proceeds of $327,537,000 ( 38,050,000,000) (see Other Operating Income above for more information). A sale-leaseback arrangement for the building housing a TIFFANY & CO. store on London Old Bond Street. Following the renovation of the store, the Company secured a long-term lease. The Company sold the building for proceeds of $148,628,000 ( 73,000,000) and simultaneously entered into a 15-year lease with two 10-year renewal options. The transaction resulted in a deferred gain of $63,961,000, which will be amortized in SG&A expenses over a 15-year period. The Company continues to occupy the entire building and the lease is accounted for as an operating lease. Net proceeds of $32,870,000 associated with the sale of Little Switzerland. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $154,409,000 in 2008, $185,608,000 in 2007 and $174,551,000 in 2006, representing 5%, 6% and 7% of net sales in those respective years. In all three years, expenditures were primarily related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution facilities and ongoing investments in new systems. Marketable Securities. The Company invests excess cash in short-term investments and marketable securities. The Company had (net purchases of) or net proceeds from investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of ($1,543,000), $13,182,000 and ($13,063,000) during 2008, 2007 and 2006. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $39,708,000 in 2008, $664,408,000 in 2007 and $248,871,000 in 2006, largely reflecting share repurchase activity. Dividends. Cash dividends on the Company Common Stock have been increased for six consecutive years, and twice in 2007. The Company Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $0.66, $0.52 and $0.38 per common share in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Cash TIFFANY & CO. K - 38 dividends paid were $82,258,000 in 2008, $69,921,000 in 2007 and $52,611,000 in 2006. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 37% in 2008, 22% in 2007 and 19% in 2006. Stock Repurchases. In January 2008, the Company Board of Directors amended the existing share repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program to January 2011 and to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional $500,000,000 of the Company Common Stock. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as price, cash availability forecasts and other market conditions. The Company stock repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 Cost of repurchases $ 218,379 $ 574,608 $ 281,176 Shares repurchased and retired 5,375 12,374 8,149 Average cost per share $ 40.63 $ 46.44 $ 34.50 At January 31, 2009, there remained $402,427,000 of authorization for future repurchases. At least annually, the Company Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flow and capital requirements. The Company suspended share repurchases during the third quarter of 2008 in order to conserve cash. Recent Borrowings. In October 2008, the Company entered into a short-term unsecured facility agreement for 6,500,000,000 ($66,001,000 at issuance) due March 2009. In December 2008, the Company repaid 2,300,000,000 ($25,473,000 at repayment). 4,200,000,000 ($46,721,000) remains outstanding at January 31, 2009. The facility was used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The weighted-average interest rate at January 31, 2009 was 1.90%. In November 2008, the Company entered into a short-term note agreement for $50,000,000 due March 2009, bearing interest at a rate of 4.50% payable monthly in arrears. These funds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. In December 2008, the Company entered into a long-term note agreement for $100,000,000 due December 2015, bearing interest at a rate of 9.05%. The proceeds will be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. In 2008, the Company repaid $60,000,000 of its 6.90% Series A Senior Notes and $13,483,000 of certain outstanding term loans. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders equity was 45% and 26% at January 31, 2009 and 2008. The increase in the ratio as of January 31, 2009 largely reflects substantial share repurchase activity during the first three quarters of 2008 and increased borrowings. At January 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. TIFFANY & CO. K - 39 Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2009: (in thousands) Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 987,837 $ 120,210 $ 210,098 $ 168,728 $ 488,801 Inventory purchase obligations 300,580 96,580 104,000 100,000 Interest on debt a 93,991 22,879 33,698 20,068 17,346 Construction-in-progress 14,868 14,868 Non-inventory purchase obligations 6,257 6,257 Other contractual obligations b 13,382 10,733 1,548 1,082 19 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 242,966 242,966 Long-term debt 465,838 40,426 262,480 62,932 100,000 $ 2,125,719 $ 554,919 $ 611,824 $ 352,810 $ 606,166 a) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. Variable-rate interest payments were estimated based on rates at January 31, 2009. Actual payments will differ based on changes in interest rates. b) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of royalty commitments. The summary above does not include the following items: $250,000,000 of long-term debt due in 2017 and 2019 and associated interest payments which was entered into subsequent to January 31, 2009 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note S. Subsequent Event ). Cash contributions to the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $30,000,000 to the pension plan in 2009. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $2,416,000 in 2009. Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2009 of $48,016,000 and accrued interest and penalties of $6,464,000. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Ongoing audits are in various stages of completion and, while the Company does not anticipate any material changes in unrecognized income tax benefits over the next 12 months, future developments in the audit process may result in a change in these assessments. TIFFANY & CO. K - 40 The following is a summary of the Company outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Credit Facility and other lines of credit at January 31, 2009: Total Borrowings Available (in thousands) Capacity Outstanding Capacity Credit Facility* $ 450,000 $ 140,834 $ 309,166 Other lines of credit 15,499 5,411 10,088 $ 465,499 $ 146,245 $ 319,254 *This facility matures in July 2010 and the capacity may be increased to $500,000,000. In addition, the Company had letters of credit and financial guarantees of $16,389,000 at January 31, 2009, of which $15,627,000 expires within one year. The Company invested $12,533,000 in Target Resources plc ( Target ), a mining and exploration company operating in Sierra Leone, consisting primarily of common stock, notes receivable and prepaid inventory. In addition, the Company entered into an agreement with Target to purchase, market and sell all diamonds extracted, produced or otherwise recovered from mining operations controlled by Target or its affiliates. As of January 31, 2009, all commitments associated with these investments were fully funded and no further amounts remain available to Target. In recent months, Target has been experiencing operational and financial difficulties in meeting its forecasts, and the current global economic conditions, specifically in the fourth quarter, have caused rough diamond prices to decline sharply which has also negatively affected Target financial results. As a result of these events, management believes there is uncertainty in Target ability to meet its future financial projections and, therefore, determined that the recoverability of the Company investments is not probable. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded impairment charges of $11,062,000 within SG&A expenses and $1,311,000 in other income, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. The Company was party to a CDN$35,000,000 ($35,423,000 at January 31, 2008) credit facility and a CDN$8,000,000 ($8,097,000 at January 31, 2008) working capital loan commitment (collectively the Commitment ) to Tahera, a Canadian diamond mining and exploration company. In consideration of the Commitment, the Company was granted the right to purchase or market all diamonds mined at the Jericho mine. This mine had been developed and constructed by Tahera in Nunavut, Canada (the Project ). Indebtedness under the Commitment is secured by certain assets of the Project. Although the Project had been operational, Tahera continued to experience financial losses as a result of production problems, appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, the rise of oil prices and other costs relative to declining diamond prices. Due to the financial difficulties, in January 2008, Tahera filed for protection from creditors pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act ( CCAA ) in Canada and had to cease operations of the Project. The Company considered the value of the assets of the Project that secured the Commitment and determined that the assets were closely associated with the underlying Project and, therefore, in order to retain their value, the assets must be part of a fully operational mine. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company management determined that collectibility of the outstanding Commitment and realization upon the liens securing the Commitment was not probable. Therefore, in 2007, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $47,981,000, within SG&A expenses, for the full amount outstanding including accrued interest under the Commitment. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Commitment and the liens were assigned for a nominal value to an unrelated third party in exchange for the right to participate in future profits, if any, derived from the exploitation of the assets. These events will not have a material impact on the Company future operations, as the Tahera mine was never a significant source of rough diamonds for the Company. TIFFANY & CO. K - 41 Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing at least one-third of annual net sales and approximately one-half of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2009, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $4,396,000 in inventory and cost of sales. The Company inventories are valued using the average cost method. Fluctuation in inventory levels, along with the costs of raw materials, could affect the carrying value of the Company inventory. Long-lived assets. The Company long-lived assets are primarily property, plant and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company recorded impairment charges of $15,532,000 in 2007 and did not record any material impairment charges in 2008 or 2006 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ). Goodwill. The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The Company recorded impairment charges of $6,893,000 in 2006 within loss from discontinued operations (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Dispositions ). The 2008 and 2007 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. TIFFANY & CO. K - 42 Income taxes. The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. The Company income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflects management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. In evaluating the Company ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans. The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used a discount rate of 6.50% to determine its 2008 pension and postretirement expense for all U.S. plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2008 pension and postretirement expenses by $2,477,000 and $355,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2008 pension and postretirement expenses by $3,927,000 and $223,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2008 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2008 pension expense by $1,044,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. TIFFANY & CO. K - 43 For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 9.00% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care was assumed for 2009. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2008 postretirement expense.
