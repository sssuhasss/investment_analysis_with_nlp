Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2016 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2016 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Introduction We are a leading managed care company, headquartered in Tampa, Florida, focusing exclusively on government-sponsored managed care services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage ("MA") and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans ("PDP") to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs. As of December 31, 2016 , we served approximately 3.9 million members in 50 states and the District of Columbia. We estimate that we are among the largest managed care organizations providing Medicaid managed care services plans, MA plans and PDPs, all as measured by membership. We believe that our broad range of experience and government focus allows us to effectively serve our members, partner with our providers, government clients and communities we serve, and efficiently manage our ongoing operations. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Summarized below are the key financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2016 . For additional information, refer to the "Results of Operations" section, which discusses both consolidated and segment results in more detail. Membership increased 3.5% in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to the Medicaid membership acquired from Care1st Health Plan Arizona, Inc. and One Care by Care1st Health Plan of Arizona, Inc. (together, "Care1st Arizona") and Advicare Corp. ("Advicare") during 2016, as well as organic membership growth in New York and Missouri, partially offset by a decline in PDP and MA membership as a result of our 2016 bid strategy. Premiums increased $346.1 million , or 2.5% , in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting organic membership growth in our Medicaid Health Plans segment, the Advicare acquisition and net rate increases in our Medicaid Health Plans segment. These increases were partially offset by the effect of lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment. Net Income increased $123.5 million , or 104.1% , in 2016 compared with 2015 driven by continued improvement, across all of our segments, in operational execution and pharmacy benefits management. Key Developments and Accomplishments Our current business strategy is achieved by focusing on integrated care management, local markets and community advocacy, regulatory and provider partnerships and delivering prudent, profitable long-term growth. See Part I, Item 1 Business for further discussion of our business strategy. Presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our business strategy that occurred or affected results of operations, financial condition and cash flows during 2016 , or occurred in 2017 prior to the filing of this 2016 Form 10-K. On January 1, 2017, we began serving Medicaid beneficiaries under Nebraska's Medicaid Managed Care program, Heritage Health. Our Nebraska contract has an initial five-year term and two additional one-year renewal options at the discretion of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services. As of January 1, 2017, we served approximately 71,000 Medicaid members in Nebraska. 51 Table of Contents On December 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Care1st Arizona from Care1st Health Plan, an affiliate of Blue Shield of California, for approximately $163.8 million, inclusive of statutory capital and subject to certain adjustments. Care1st Arizona provides Medicaid and Medicare benefits to approximately 117,000 and 2,000 beneficiaries, respectively, in Maricopa and Pima counties, Arizona largest geographic service areas. The transaction was funded with available cash on hand. Given that the transaction was completed on December 31, 2016, Care1st Arizona's 2016 results of operations were not significant to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016. In December 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets, including Medicaid membership and certain provider contracts, from Phoenix Health Plan ("PHP"), a wholly owned managed care subsidiary of Tenet Healthcare. PHP provides health benefits to more than 50,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Maricopa County, Arizona. The transaction is expected to close by the second quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to be funded with available cash on hand. In December 2016, we entered into a contract amendment with the Kentucky Department of Medicaid Services that renewed our participation in the Kentucky Medicaid program through June 30, 2017, and included three additional one-year renewal periods upon mutual agreement. In November 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Universal American Corp. ("UAM"), to acquire all of the outstanding stock of UAM in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $800.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, UAM served approximately 69,000 MA members in Texas and approximately 45,000 members in the northeast, primarily New York. In addition, UAM partnered with Accountable Care Organizations in 11 states as of September 30, 2016, six of which were in WellCare MA markets. The transaction is expected to be funded with available cash on hand and to close by the second quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. In October 2016, we received a Notice of Award from the Missouri Office of Administration, Division of Purchasing to continue to participate in the MO HealthNet Managed Care (Medicaid) program, including expansion of our Medicaid program statewide. Services under the new contract are expected to begin on May 1, 2017, with an initial one-year term and four additional one-year renewal options. As of December 31, 2016, we served approximately 121,000 Medicaid members in Missouri. In September 2016, we repaid $100.0 million of the $200.0 million borrowed under our credit facility, and as a result $100.0 million remained outstanding as a component of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2016. In January 2016, we had entered into a new $850.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing and terminating the previous senior unsecured credit facility. Upon closing, through a combination of $200.0 million borrowed as a revolving loan under our credit facility and $100.0 million in cash, we repaid in full the $300.0 million term loan due in September 2016 (the "Term Loan") under the previous credit facility. In 2016, we entered into a new contract with Georgia Department of Community Health ( Georgia DCH ) and anticipate services under that contract would commence on July 1, 2017, with an initial one-year term and four additional one-year renewal options at Georgia DCH's discretion. The new contract is subject to approval by CMS. As of December 31, 2016, we served approximately 571,000 Medicaid members in Georgia. In June 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Advicare, a managed care organization that provides Medicaid benefits in South Carolina. The acquired assets primarily relate to members who were transferred to our Medicaid plan in South Carolina, as well as certain provider agreements. In March 2016, we extended our contract with the New York State Department of Health to continue providing managed care services for children as part of the Child Health Plus program in 16 counties. The extension runs through September 2019 and does not require annual renewals. Effective January 1, 2016, we transitioned our pharmacy benefits management to CVS Health Corporation. 52 Table of Contents General Economic Environment, Political Environment and Health Care Reform Please refer to Part I, Item 1 Business, General Economic and Political Environment Affecting our Business and Health Care Reform for a further discussion of the current economic and political environment that is affecting our business, including discussion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA") and its potential effect on our business. Refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results The following table sets forth condensed data from our consolidated statements of operations data, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussions for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenues: (Dollars in millions) Premium $ 14,220.9 $ 13,874.8 $ 12,915.5 Investment and other income 16.2 15.4 44.4 Total revenues 14,237.1 13,890.2 12,959.9 Expenses and other: Medical benefits 12,089.4 11,978.5 11,455.2 Selling, general and administrative 1,133.1 1,132.9 1,018.8 ACA industry fee 228.4 227.3 137.7 Medicaid premium taxes 110.0 94.7 76.5 Depreciation and amortization 87.6 72.6 59.9 Interest 59.1 54.2 39.4 Impairment and other charges 24.1 Gain on divestiture of business (6.1 ) Total expenses, net 13,707.6 13,554.1 12,811.6 Income from operations 529.5 336.1 148.3 Bargain purchase gain 29.5 Income before income taxes 529.5 336.1 177.8 Income tax expense 287.4 217.5 114.1 Net income $ 242.1 $ 118.6 $ 63.7 Effective tax rate 54.3 % 64.7 % 64.2 % Membership by Segment Medicaid Health Plans 2,544,000 2,388,000 2,310,000 Medicare Health Plans 345,000 354,000 417,000 Medicare PDPs 1,009,000 1,025,000 1,392,000 Total 3,898,000 3,767,000 4,119,000 53 Table of Contents Membership 2016 vs. 2015 As of December 31, 2016 , membership increased approximately 131,000 , or 3.5% , compared with December 31, 2015 . Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Membership increased by 156,000 , or 6.5% , compared with December 31, 2015, primarily due to the membership acquired from Care1st Arizona and Advicare during 2016, as well as organic membership growth in New York and Missouri. These increases were partially offset by a membership decline in Georgia. Medicare Health Plans. Membership decreased by 9,000 , or 2.5% , compared with December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our 2016 bid positioning, including planned service area reductions for the 2016 plan year. Medicare PDPs. Membership decreased by 16,000 , or 1.6% , compared with December 31, 2015 . The decrease was primarily the result of our 2016 bid strategy. Our 2016 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 17 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in nine other regions, compared with our 2015 bids, in which our plans were below the benchmarks in 13 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids and in the de minimis range in nine regions. 2015 vs. 2014 Membership decreased 8.5% in 2015, mainly driven by membership declines in our Medicare PDPs and Medicare Health Plans segments due to our Medicare bid positioning for the 2015 plan year, partially offset by organic membership growth within our Medicaid Health Plans segment. Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Membership increased by 78,000, or 3.4%, compared with December 31, 2014, primarily driven by organic growth in the Florida, Kentucky and Missouri programs, partially offset by a decrease in membership in our Georgia Medicaid market due to statewide eligibility recertifications. Medicare Health Plans. Membership decreased by 63,000, or 15.1%, compared with December 31, 2014. The decrease was due to a reduction in our California and New York Medicare membership due to bid actions and county withdrawals in 2015, as well as our exit from the Arizona, Missouri and Ohio MA markets. The reduction also reflects the divestiture of our Medicare Supplement business, which was completed on July 1, 2015. These decreases are partially offset by organic membership growth in Florida and Texas. Medicare PDPs. Membership decreased by 367,000, or 26.4%, compared with December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to bid positioning for the 2015 plan year, in which our plans were below the benchmarks in 13 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids and in the de minimis range in nine regions compared with our 2014 bids, in which we were below the benchmark in 30 out of 33 regions, and in the de minimis range in two other regions. PDP members who had been auto-assigned to us in 2014 in regions where our plans were not below or within the de minimis range for 2015 were assigned to other plans effective January 1, 2015. Net income 2016 vs. 2015 For the year ended December 31, 2016 , our net income increased by $123.5 million , or 104.1% , compared with the same period of 2015, primarily attributable to continued improvement, across all of our segments, in operational execution and pharmacy benefits management. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of current developments, operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. 2015 vs. 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income increased by $54.9 million, or 86.2%, compared with the same period of 2014, primarily attributable to improved performance in all segments, organic growth in our Medicaid membership and improved pharmacy rebates management, partially offset by the increase in unreimbursed ACA industry fee expense for 2015. 54 Table of Contents Premium revenue 2016 vs. 2015 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased approximately $346.1 million , or 2.5% , compared with the same period in 2015, reflecting organic membership growth in our Medicaid Health Plans segment, the Advicare acquisition and net rate increases in certain Medicaid markets. These increases were partially offset by the effect of lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment and the divestiture of Sterling Life Insurance Company ("Sterling"), our former Medicare Supplement business, on July 1, 2015. 2015 vs. 2014 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $959.3 million, or 7.4%, compared with the same period in 2014, reflecting higher membership in our Medicaid Health Plans segment, primarily from organic growth in Florida, Kentucky, and Illinois and increased ACA industry fee reimbursement from our Medicaid customers. These increases were partially offset by lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment resulting from the bid positioning taken for the 2015 plan year, as well as the divestiture of our former Medicare Supplement business. The increase in premium revenue in 2015 also reflects a full year of premiums related to the Healthfirst acquisition, which was completed on July 1, 2014. Medical benefits expense 2016 vs. 2015 Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $110.9 million , or 0.9% , compared with the same period in 2015 , primarily driven by organic Medicaid membership growth and the Advicare acquisition, partially offset by the favorable result of actions taken relating to our 2016 MA and PDP bids and the divestiture of our Medicare Supplement business in 2015. 2015 vs. 2014 Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $523.3 million, or 4.6%, compared with the same period in 2014, primarily due to the increased organic Medicaid membership. The increase was partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development of $78.1 million recognized in 2015, compared with unfavorable prior year reserve development of $48.1 million recognized in 2014, as well as lower membership in our Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs segments resulting from our 2015 bid positioning. The increase in medical benefits expense for 2015 also reflected a full year of expense related to our Healthfirst NJ acquisition completed in 2014. 55 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense SG&A expense includes aggregate costs related to the resolution of the previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation and resolution costs ("Investigation costs"). Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these costs. SG&A expense also includes certain activities relating to the divestiture of Sterling Life Insurance Company ("Sterling divestiture costs"), transitory costs related to our decision to change our pharmacy claims processing to a new pharmacy benefit manager ("PBM") effective January 1, 2016, ("PBM transitory costs") and non-recurring Iowa SG&A costs relating to readiness costs, certain wind-down costs of WellCare's Iowa operations and certain legal costs incurred during 2015 and 2016 ("Iowa SG&A costs"). We believe it is appropriate to evaluate SG&A expense exclusive of these costs as we do not consider them to be indicative of long-term business operations. A reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding such costs, is presented below. For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 1,133.1 $ 1,132.9 $ 1,018.8 Adjustments: Investigation costs (16.0 ) (30.4 ) (37.6 ) Sterling divestiture costs (1.7 ) (2.0 ) PBM transitory costs (4.9 ) (18.1 ) Iowa SG&A costs (5.2 ) (11.9 ) Adjusted SG&A Expense $ 1,105.3 $ 1,070.5 $ 981.2 SG&A ratio (1) 8.0 % 8.2 % 7.9 % Adjusted SG&A ratio (2) 8.0 % 7.9 % 7.7 % (1) SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue. (2) Adjusted SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that these components are not indicative of operating performance. 2016 vs. 2015 Our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 remained consistent compared with the same period in 2015 . Our Adjusted SG&A expense for year ended December 31, 2016 increased approximately $34.8 million , or 3.3% , compared with the same period in 2015 . The increase is primarily due to normal operating and ramp-up costs associated with current and future growth in Medicaid membership and higher short-term and long-term management incentive compensation due to improved Company performance, partially offset by lower members in our Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDP segments and continued improvements in operational efficiency. Our SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 20 basis points compared with the same period in 2015 , primarily driven by continued improvements in operating efficiency and lower investigation and PBM transitory costs, partially offset by the higher short-term and long-term management incentive compensation due to improved Company performance. Our Adjusted SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the same period in 2015. 2015 vs. 2014 Our SG&A expense and Adjusted SG&A expense increased approximately $114.1 million, or 11.2%, and $89.3 million, or 9.1%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2014, primarily due to normal operating costs associated with the 2015 growth in Medicaid membership, continued investments in our healthcare value-added programs and the effect of lower compensation expense in 2014 resulting from lower management incentive compensation. The increases were partially offset by lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment and continued improvements in operating efficiency. Our SG&A ratio and Adjusted SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared with the same period in 2014, primarily reflecting lower compensation expense in 2014 related to lower management incentive compensation, partially offset by continued improvements in operating efficiency in 2015. 56 Table of Contents ACA Industry Fee 2016 vs. 2015 We were assessed $228.4 million for the ACA industry fee for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $227.3 million for the same period in 2015, consistent year-over-year as the total fee levied on the industry remained at $11.3 billion in 2016. We received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all of our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee attributable to our Medicaid programs, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. 2015 vs. 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2015, the ACA industry fee increased approximately $89.6 million compared with the same period in 2014. The higher expense is due to the increased total fee levied on the industry, from $8 billion in 2014 to $11.3 billion in 2015, and the increase in our share of total industry premiums for 2014. Interest expense 2016 vs. 2015 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased approximately $4.9 million compared with the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the additional $300.0 million issuance of our 5.75% senior notes due 2020 (the "Senior Notes") in June 2015. 2015 vs. 2014 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $14.8 million compared with the same period in 2014, primarily driven by the higher average debt levels during 2015, resulting from the issuance of the Term Loan in September 2014 and the additional Senior Notes issuance noted above. 2014 Impairment and other charges During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $24.1 million in impairment and other charges. This primarily relates to the partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of Easy Choice as well as the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the purchase of certain assets from a small health plan in 2012. Lastly, the charges also included the resolution of certain matters related to the purchase price of our 2013 acquisitions. We were no longer able to recognize such charges as adjustments to acquired assets since we were beyond the measurement period established in the accounting rules for business combinations. 2014 Bargain Purchase Gain As a result of the Windsor acquisition on January 1, 2014, we recognized a bargain purchase gain of approximately $29.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, as the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired exceeded the total consideration paid or payable to the seller. After consideration of all relevant factors, we concluded that the excess fair value constituted a bargain purchase gain in accordance with accounting rules related to business combinations. Income tax expense 2016 vs. 2015 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $69.9 million , or 32.1% , compared with the same period in 2015, while the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 54.3% compared with 64.7% for the same period in 2015. The increase in income tax expense and decrease in the effective tax rate were both attributable to higher income before income taxes, as well as the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09 " Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ." Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 also includes the favorable effect of the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits. Refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 2 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this 2016 Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in 2016, respectively. 57 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $103.4 million, or 90.6% , compared with the same period in 2014 primarily resulting from higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was consistent as compared with the prior year. Segment Reporting Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the enterprise's chief operating decision maker to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Accordingly, we have three reportable segments: Medicaid Health Plans, Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs. Segment Financial Performance Measures Our primary measurements of profitability for our reportable segments are premium revenue, gross margin and MBR. Gross margin is defined as premium revenue less medical benefits expense, less ACA industry fees. MBR measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement. We use gross margin and MBR to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense. These metrics are utilized to make various business decisions, including which health care plans to offer, quality improvement initiatives to implement, geographic areas to enter or exit and health care providers to include in our networks. For further information regarding premium revenues and medical benefits expense, please refer below to " Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable " and " Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable " under " Critical Accounting Estimates. " Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our income from operations (before income taxes), as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Gross Margin: (In millions) Medicaid Health Plans $ 1,162.8 $ 1,072.4 $ 839.2 Medicare Health Plans 533.9 428.4 411.6 Medicare PDPs 206.4 168.2 71.8 Total gross margin 1,903.1 1,669.0 1,322.6 Investment and other income 16.2 15.4 44.4 Other expenses, net (1) (1,389.8 ) (1,348.3 ) (1,218.7 ) Income from operations $ 529.5 $ 336.1 $ 148.3 (1) Other expenses, net includes selling, general and administrative expenses, Medicaid premium taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest and impairment and other charges. Other expenses, net for 2015 also includes the gain on the Sterling divestiture. 58 Table of Contents Medicaid Health Plans Our Medicaid Health Plans segment includes plans for beneficiaries of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ("TANF"), Supplemental Security Income ("SSI"), Aged Blind and Disabled ("ABD") and other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP") and Managed Long-Term Care ("MLTC") programs, including long-term services and supports. As of December 31, 2016, we operated Medicaid health plans in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. As previously noted, the acquisition of our Arizona Medicaid plan (Care1st Arizona) was completed on December 31, 2016, and therefore Care1st Arizona's 2016 results of operations were not significant to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016. We began serving Nebraska Medicaid beneficiaries effective January 1, 2017. Medicaid Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicaid segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Premium revenue (1) $ 9,144.4 $ 8,760.4 $ 7,572.8 Medicaid premium taxes (1) 110.0 94.7 76.5 Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement (1) 244.9 219.2 124.6 Total premiums 9,499.3 9,074.3 7,773.9 Medical benefits expense 8,188.5 7,866.8 6,853.1 ACA industry fee 148.0 135.1 81.6 Gross margin $ 1,162.8 $ 1,072.4 $ 839.2 Medicaid Health Plans MBR (1) 86.2 % 86.7 % 88.2 % Effect of: Medicaid premium taxes 1.0 % 1.0 % 0.9 % Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement 2.3 % 2.1 % 1.4 % Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR (1) 89.5 % 89.8 % 90.5 % Medicaid Health Plans Membership: Florida 780,000 781,000 722,000 Georgia 571,000 585,000 604,000 Kentucky 440,000 440,000 420,000 Other states (2) 753,000 582,000 564,000 2,544,000 2,388,000 2,310,000 (1) For GAAP reporting purposes, Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements are included in premium revenue to measure our MBR. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that these components are not indicative of operating performance. (2) "All other states" consists of Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina during all years presented. In 2016, it also includes Arizona. 59 Table of Contents 2016 vs. 2015 Medicaid total premiums increased $425.0 million , or 4.7% , for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $384.0 million , or 4.4% , compared with the same period in 2015 . The increases were primarily driven by organic membership growth, net rate increases for the Florida MMA program, and the acquisition of Advicare, effective June 1, 2016. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $321.7 million , or 4.1% , compared with the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the organic membership growth, the acquisition of Advicare and other factors including net medical trend and mix of membership. Our Medicaid Health Plans MBR decreased by 50 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR decreased by 30 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015. The decreases in both MBRs were primarily driven by improved operational execution and pharmacy cost structure, as well as higher ACA industry fee reimbursement (affecting the Medicaid Health Plans MBR). 2015 vs. 2014 Medicaid total premiums increased $1.3 billion , or 16.7% , for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the same period in 2014. Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $1.2 billion, or 15.7%, compared with the same period in 2014. These increases were driven by increased membership in Florida due to organic growth and participation in the Florida MMA program, higher per member per month ("PMPM") rates related to the Florida MMA membership, growth in Kentucky from increased participation in the ACA Medicaid expansion program and growth in Illinois resulting from higher auto-assigned membership. The increase in Medicaid premium revenue in 2015 also reflects a full year of premiums related to the Healthfirst NJ acquisition. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $1.0 billion, or 14.8%, compared with the same period in 2014, primarily driven by the increase in membership. Our Medicaid Health Plans MBR decreased by 150 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with 2014. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR decreased by 70 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to improved operating performance across the segment, in particular in our Florida MMA program, which included a rate increase for this program that was effective September 1, 2015, as well as unfavorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by a rate decrease in Kentucky that was effective July 1, 2015. Medicare Health Plans We contract with CMS under the Medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of Part C and Part D benefits to Medicare eligible persons through our MA plans. Our MA plans are comprised of coordinated care plans ("CCPs"), which are administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a primary care physician from a network of health care providers. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of most of our MA plans. In 2016, we operated our MA CCPs in 397 counties across 15 states, including Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Effective December 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 2,000 Care1st Arizona Medicare members, which expanded our presence into one additional state, covering two additional counties. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans. For many of our plans, we provide additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced, which allows our members to better manage their health care costs. We continue to focus on three main areas in MA, including: Execution on healthcare value-added initiatives led by our clinical services group; Continued application of a more disciplined portfolio approach to our MA bids, including a focus on net income; and Improving Star Ratings, both in terms of execution on quality initiatives and our advocacy position to properly match the ratings, rules and economics with the prevalent data that demonstrates the connection between socio-economic status and lower quality ratings. 60 Table of Contents As a result of the Windsor acquisition completed on January 1, 2014, we began offering Medicare Supplement products. Accordingly, we included results for Medicare Supplement operations together with our MA plans within the Medicare Health Plans segment through June 30, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our Medicare Supplement business through the Sterling divestiture. The operations of our Medicare Supplement business were not material to overall segment results. Medicare Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare Health Plans segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 3,876.6 $ 3,898.8 $ 3,963.2 Medical benefits expense 3,278.5 3,401.7 3,506.9 ACA industry fee 64.2 68.7 44.7 Gross margin $ 533.9 $ 428.4 $ 411.6 Medicare Health Plans Membership 345,000 354,000 417,000 Medicare Health Plans MBR 84.6 % 87.2 % 88.5 % 2016 vs. 2015 Medicare Health Plans premium revenue in 2016 decreased marginally by $22.2 million , or 0.6% , compared with the same period in 2015 , primarily due to the Sterling divestiture partially offset by our Medicare Advantage 2016 bid positioning. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $123.2 million , or 3.6% , compared with the same period in 2015 , primarily due to the lower membership and the Sterling divestiture. The Medicare Health Plans MBR decreased by 260 basis points compared with 2015, resulting from our 2016 bid strategy and continued clinical and operational improvement. 2015 vs. 2014 Medicare Health Plans premium revenue in 2015 decreased $64.4 million, or 1.6%, compared with the same period in 2014, primarily resulting from the decline in membership as a result of our 2015 bid actions, which included exiting two counties in California, as well as exiting from MA in Arizona, Missouri and Ohio. The decline also reflects the divestiture of Sterling, partially offset by organic membership growth in Florida and Texas. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $105.2 million, or 3.0%, compared with the same period in 2014, primarily driven by the decrease in membership discussed above and improved operational execution on healthcare value-added programs during 2015. The Medicare Health Plans MBR decreased by 130 basis points compared with 2014, reflecting improved operating performance as a result of bid actions for the 2015 plan year as well as improved operational execution on medical expense initiatives launched in 2015. Medicare PDPs We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDPs to Medicare eligible beneficiaries through our Medicare PDPs segment. As of December 31, 2016, we offered PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia. The PDP benefit design generally results in our incurring a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the first half of a plan year and less in the second half of a plan year due to the members' share of cumulative out-of-pocket costs increasing throughout the plan year. As a result, the Medicare PDPs MBR generally decreases throughout the year. Also, the level and mix of members who are auto-assigned to us and those who actively choose our PDPs will affect the segment MBR pattern across periods. 61 Table of Contents Medicare PDPs Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare PDPs segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 845.0 $ 901.7 $ 1,178.4 Medical benefits expense 622.4 710.0 1,095.2 ACA industry fee 16.2 23.5 11.4 Gross margin $ 206.4 $ 168.2 $ 71.8 Medicare PDPs membership 1,009,000 1,025,000 1,392,000 Medicare PDPs MBR 73.7 % 78.7 % 92.9 % 2016 vs. 2015 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue decreased $56.7 million , or 6.3% , in 2016 compared with 2015 , primarily due to the decrease in membership resulting from our 2016 bid strategy. The Medicare PDPs MBR for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 500 basis points over the same period in 2015, reflecting improvement in our pharmacy cost structure, including rebate management, and continued improved operational execution. 2015 vs. 2014 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue decreased $276.7 million, or 23.5%, in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the decrease in membership resulting from specific actions taken in the 2015 bids. The Medicare PDPs MBR for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 1,420 basis points over the same period in 2014, reflecting improvement from bid positioning taken to better balance membership and margin improvement for the 2015 plan year, an improvement in pharmacy rebates and improved operational execution. 2017 Outlook The guidance below does not reflect the pending acquisitions of UAM and PHP. Medicaid Health Plans - We expect premium revenue (GAAP) for our Medicaid Health Plans segment to be in the range of $10.3 billion to $10.7 billion for 2017, compared with $9.5 billion for 2016. We expect premium revenue for our Medicaid Health Plans, excluding $113.0 million to $118.0 million in Medicaid premium taxes, to be in the range of $10.2 billion to $10.6 billion for 2017, compared with $9.1 billion reported for 2016, excluding $244.9 million in Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement and $110.0 million in Medicaid premium taxes. The expected year-over-year increase reflects our expansion into the Nebraska Medicaid market, effective January 1, 2017; Missouri Medicaid reprocurement with an expanded service area; acquisition of Care1st Arizona; and organic growth. The Medicaid Health Plans MBR (GAAP) is expected to be in the range of 88.60% to 89.60% for 2017, compared with 86.2% for 2016. The Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR is expected to be in the range of 89.50% to 90.50%, consistent with 89.5% reported in 2016. Medicare Health Plans - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare Health Plans segment to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion for 2017, compared with $3.9 billion reported for 2016. Medicare Health Plans MBR is expected to be in the range of 85.50% to 86.75% for 2017, compared with 84.6% in 2016, reflecting planned increased quality investments and bid process considerations due to the ACA industry fee moratorium in 2017. 62 Table of Contents Medicare PDPs - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare PDPs segment to be in the range of $825.0 million to $900.0 million for 2017, compared with $845.0 million for 2016, primarily due to our bid positioning for the 2017 plan year. Medicare PDPs MBR is expected to be in the range of 80.50% to 82.50% for 2017, compared with 73.7% for 2016 due to our bid positioning for the 2017 plan year. Consolidated SG&A - Our consolidated SG&A ratio (GAAP) is not estimable as we currently are not able to project future amounts associated with investigation costs. We expect that our consolidated Adjusted SG&A ratio, which excludes the effect of investigation costs, for 2017 will be approximately 7.7% to 7.9%, compared with 8.0% for 2016, resulting from improved operating leverage associated with premium revenue growth. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is affected by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. Additionally, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent and other non-regulated companies ("non-regulated subsidiaries") are dependent upon dividends and management fees from our regulated subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity and cash flows, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors included in this 2016 Form 10-K. Liquidity The Company maintains liquidity at two levels: the regulated subsidiary level and the non-regulated subsidiary level. Regulated subsidiaries Our regulated subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include: payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; selling, general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through a management services agreement to one of our non-regulated administrative and management services subsidiaries; federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement; and dividends paid to our non-regulated subsidiaries, as approved by our state regulators. Our regulated subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by: generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; receipts of prospective subsidy payments and related final settlements from CMS to reimburse us for certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. We refer collectively to the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as "regulated cash and investments." Our regulated subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, regulated cash and cash equivalents can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. Our unrestricted regulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2016 , compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 2015, due primarily to the Medicare Part D 2015 plan year settlement received in November 2016 (discussed further in Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements below), earnings from improved operations and $59.4 million of capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. These increases were partially offset by $241.0 million in dividends distributed to our non-regulated subsidiaries and the $228.4 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS in September 2016. Funding may be provided to certain regulated subsidiaries from our unregulated subsidiaries to cover any shortfall resulting from the amount of Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS that exceeds the prospective subsidy payments that these regulated subsidiaries receive from CMS, which is discussed further in Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements below. 63 Table of Contents Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. We continue to maintain appropriate levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated subsidiaries. See further discussion under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions below. Parent and non-regulated subsidiaries Liquidity requirements at the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level generally consist of: payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, business development, rent, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated subsidiaries; capital expenditures; acquisition-related funding and transaction expenses; debt service; and federal tax payments. Our non-regulated parent and subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by: management fees earned by our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under management services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments. Unregulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $915.3 million at December 31, 2016 , an increase of $99.2 million from $816.1 million at December 31, 2015. This increase reflects normal operating cash flows including lower Medicare Part D funding to certain regulated subsidiaries, as described below, as well as dividends received from certain regulated subsidiaries during 2016. These increases were partially offset by $200 million net cash payments to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facilities during 2016, cash paid for the Care1st Arizona and Advicare acquisitions in 2016, and capital contributions paid to certain regulated subsidiaries. Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. A discussion of the subsidy components under Part D is included in Note 2- Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2016 Form 10-K. The benefits include the catastrophic reinsurance, premium and cost sharing for low income Part D members ("LICS"), for which CMS will fully reimburse these subsidies as part of its annual settlement process that occurs in the fourth quarter of the subsequent year. In November 2016, we received a $556.3 million settlement payment from CMS primarily relating to catastrophic reinsurance and LICS cost reimbursements for the 2015 Part D plan year, which resulted in a meaningful reduction to our funds receivable for the benefit of members. Growth in our PDP and MA membership and high drug unit costs in 2014 resulted in higher benefit payments made on behalf of CMS compared with our bids and compared with prior years, as well as an increase in the CMS risk corridor receivable. Based on our experience in 2014, our 2015 PDP and MA bids reflected significantly higher estimates for cash outflows for the government's responsibility of the Part D benefit plan design, particularly for the catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. However, the level of subsidy payments we made on behalf of CMS compared with our 2015 bids were still significant due to the composition of our 2015 PDP membership, which reflected a higher number of dual-eligible members relative to our overall membership than expected in our original 2015 bids. Government Investigation and Litigation Under the terms of the settlement agreements entered into by us on April 26, 2011, and finalized on March 23, 2012, to resolve matters under investigation by the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Civil Division") and certain other federal and state enforcement agencies (the "Settlement"), WellCare agreed to pay the Civil Division a total of $137.5 million in four equal annual principal payments, plus interest accrued at 3.125%. The final payment of $35.4 million, which included accrued interest, was remitted to the Civil Division during March 2015. 64 Table of Contents We currently maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance in the amount of $125.0 million for matters not addressed above. Cash Flow Activities Our cash flows are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 748.3 $ 712.6 $ 299.3 Net cash used in investing activities (27.0 ) (124.2 ) (75.6 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 833.1 505.1 (392.7 ) Total net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,554.4 $ 1,093.5 $ (169.0 ) Cash flows from operating activities We generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services; however, cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premium receipts from our government partners. 2016 vs. 2015 Cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was $748.3 million compared with $712.6 million for 2015, primarily due to improved year-over-year operating performance across all segments and the timing of certain pharmacy rebate receipts and claims payments. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a $228.4 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS in September 2016, compared with $227.3 million remitted for such fee in September 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was reduced by the $35.4 million final payment remitted to the Civil Division in March 2015. See further discussion in Government Investigation and Litigation below. 2015 vs. 2014 Cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was $712.6 million compared with $299.3 million for 2014. The improvement in cash flow from operations primarily resulted from improved year-over-year operating performance across all segments and higher pharmacy rebates consistent with an improved pharmacy rebates management contract. The increase is also related to the timing of settlement of the current year Medicare Part D risk corridor payables due to CMS as compared with the Medicare Part D risk corridor net receivables in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by the $227.3 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS in September 2015, compared with $137.7 million remitted for such fee in September 2014. Cash flows from investing activities 2016 vs. 2015 Net cash used in investing activities for 2016 was $27.0 million compared with $124.2 million for the same period in 2015, primarily resulting from higher net proceeds from the sales of investments in 2016, partially offset by the acquisitions of Care1st Arizona and Advicare and the effect of higher additions to capitalized software during 2015 resulting from investments in our information technology infrastructure. 65 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Net cash used in investing activities for 2015 was $124.2 million compared with $75.6 million for the same period in 2014, resulting primarily from net cash used in acquisitions and acquisition-related settlements of $17.2 million in 2015, related to the final balance sheet settlement of the Windsor acquisition, compared with $48.0 million of net cash acquired from acquisitions in 2014. The increase is also a result of higher additions to capitalized software during 2015 resulting from investments in our information technology infrastructure. The increases are partially offset by proceeds from the sales of investments in 2015 compared with net purchases of investments in 2014. Cash flows from financing activities 2016 vs. 2015 Cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by net funds received or paid for the benefit of members of our MA and PDP plans as well as debt-related activity. Net funds received for the benefit of members was approximately $1.0 billion in 2016 , compared with $201.1 million during the same period in 2015. These funds represent the net amount of prescription drug benefits we paid in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government's portion of financial responsibility, net of the related subsidies received from CMS, as described above in "Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements." Additionally, in January 2016, $200.0 million of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (described below) was drawn upon and, along with $100.0 million in cash, used to repay our $300.0 million Term Loan. In September 2016, we repaid $100.0 million of the $200.0 million borrowed under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Debt-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes net proceeds of $308.9 million resulting from the issuance of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes. 2015 vs. 2014 Cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by net funds received or paid for the benefit of members of our MA and PDP plans as well as debt-related activity. Cash flows from financing activities in 2015 increased by $897.8 million compared with the same period in 2014 primarily resulting from net funds received for the benefit of members of approximately $201.1 million in 2015, compared with funds paid of $687.9 million during the same period in 2014. These funds represent the net amounts of prescription drug benefits we paid or collected in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government's portion of financial responsibility, net of the related subsidies received from CMS inclusive of the annual settlement payments. We received a $845.5 million settlement payment from CMS during 2015 relating to the 2014 Part D plan year, which significantly improved financing cash flows for 2015 compared with 2014. Additionally, in June 2015, we received net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes discussed above, compared with net proceeds of $298.6 million in 2014 resulting from the Term Loan issuance in September 2014. 66 Table of Contents Capital Resources Senior Notes In June 2015, we completed the offering and sale of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes pursuant to a reopening of our existing series of such notes. The offering was completed at an issue price of 104.50%, plus accrued interest, and resulted in a debt premium of $13.5 million, which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior Notes. Interest is payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. As of December 31, 2016, our outstanding Senior Notes totaled $909.6 million , including $9.6 million of unamortized debt premium, inclusive of our Senior Notes described above as well as $600.0 million issued in November 2013. The Senior Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of November 14, 2013, (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2013, (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") each between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; make other restricted payments and investments; sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; create certain liens; incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make other payments and guarantee indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and merge or consolidate with other entities. Credit Agreement In January 2016, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Agreement ), which provides for a senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the "2016 Revolving Credit Facility"), with an initial aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $850.0 million. The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility of up to $850.0 million (the loans thereunder, the Revolving Credit Loans ), of which up to $150.0 million is available for letters of credit. The 2016 Credit Agreement also provides that we may, at our option, increase the aggregate amount of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an amount up to $200.0 million without the consent of any lenders not participating in such increase, subject to certain customary conditions and lenders committing to provide the increase in funding. Unutilized commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement are subject to a fee of 0.25% to 0.35% depending upon our ratio of total net debt to cash flow. At the closing of the 2016 Credit Agreement, $200.0 million of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was drawn upon and, along with $100.0 million in cash, used to repay our $300.0 million term loan under our prior credit agreement, which was terminated. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Loans may be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, organic growth and acquisitions. In September 2016, we repaid $100.0 million of the $200.0 million borrowed under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and as a result, $100.0 million remained outstanding as a component of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2016. Commitments under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility expire on January 8, 2021, and any amounts outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility will be payable in full at that time. The interest rate on the outstanding amount of the 2016 Credit Facility was 2.25% as of December 31, 2016. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as ABR Loans that are outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) in effect on such day; (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%; and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%; plus (ii) the Applicable Rate. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as Eurodollar Loans that are outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate means a percentage ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum for ABR Loans and a percentage ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum for Eurodollar Loans, depending upon our ratio of total debt to cash flow, as calculated in accordance with the 2016 Credit Agreement. 67 Table of Contents The 2016 Credit Agreement includes negative and financial covenants that limit certain activities of us and our subsidiaries, including (i) restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness; and (ii) financial covenants that require (a) the ratio of total net debt to cash flow not to exceed a maximum; and (b) a minimum interest expense and principal payment coverage ratio. The 2016 Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the 2016 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, we may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement. Lenders holding at least 50% of the loans and commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of the loans and/or terminate the commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. As of December 31, 2016, and as of the date of this filing, we remain in compliance with all covenants under both the Senior Notes and the 2016 Credit Agreement. For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 10 - Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements Shelf Registration Statement In November 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that became automatically effective covering the registration, issuance and sale of an indeterminate amount of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, senior or subordinated debt securities, depository shares, securities purchase contracts, units or warrants. We may publicly offer securities in the future at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We may pursue alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives may include, but are not limited to; obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries, provided sufficient capital in excess of regulatory requirements exists in these subsidiaries and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. We believe that we have sufficient capital, or sufficient access to capital, including through the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, to meet our capital needs, including pending acquisitions, for at least the next twelve months. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, a statutory minimum, risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and have been adopted by most states. The statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries' minimum capital requirements could change over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. To the extent our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. Based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement, or net assets, for these subsidiaries that may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $871.8 million at December 31, 2016 , and $807.9 million at December 31, 2015 . The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which was in compliance with and in excess of the minimum capital requirements as of those dates. 68 Table of Contents Such statues, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. Some states require prior approval of all dividends, regardless of amount. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior 12 months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. We received $241.0 million , $152.0 million and $68.0 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. The 2016 amount included $49.6 million not requiring prior regulatory approval, and $191.4 million paid after obtaining prior regulatory approval. Under applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2016 , the amount of dividends that may be paid through the end of 2017 by our HMO and insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities is approximately $210.7 million in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. For additional information on regulatory requirements, see Note 17 Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 . Payments due to period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (In millions) Operating leases $ 139.5 $ 32.3 $ 51.1 $ 35.7 $ 20.4 Purchase obligations (1) 90.5 36.5 49.0 5.0 Long-term debt (2) 1,000.0 1,000.0 Interest on debt (3) 214.4 54.6 110.6 49.2 Total $ 1,444.4 $ 123.4 $ 210.7 $ 1,089.9 $ 20.4 (1) Our purchase obligations include commitments under contracts for equipment leases and software maintenance. (2) Represents the principal amount of our outstanding Senior Notes and Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016. These amounts exclude the remaining $9.6 million debt premium on the Senior Notes, which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior Notes. Additionally, these amounts are gross of $12.0 million of debt issuance costs, which is reflected as a reduction of our long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) Represents projected interest on the $900.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes and $100.0 million Credit Facility outstanding as of December 31, 2016. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2016 , we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table above. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting estimates relating to premium revenue 69 Table of Contents recognition and premiums receivable, medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable, and goodwill and intangible assets, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable We earn premium revenue through our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid-related and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid contracts with state agencies generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions, while our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts establish fixed, monthly premium rates per member ("PMPM"), which are generally determined at the beginning of each new contract renewal period; however, premiums may be adjusted by CMS and state agencies throughout the terms of the contracts in certain cases. Premium rate changes are recognized in the period the change becomes effective, when the effect of the change in the rate is reasonably estimable and collection is assured. Our contracts also have additional provisions as described in the sections below. We recognize premium revenue in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. We are generally paid by CMS and state agencies in the month in which we provide services. On a monthly basis, we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan. We record premiums earned but not received as premiums receivable and record premiums received in advance of the period of service as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheets. Unearned premiums are recognized as revenue when we provide the related services. Member premiums are recognized as revenue in the period of service. We estimate, on an on-going basis, the amount of members' billings that may not be collectible, based on our evaluation of historical trends. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible. In addition, we routinely monitor the collectability of specific premiums receivable from CMS and state agencies, including Medicaid receivables for obstetric deliveries and newborns and net receivables for member retroactivity and reduce revenue and premiums receivable by the amount we estimate may not be collectible. Premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by CMS and state agencies. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, CMS and state agencies require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received for individuals who were subsequently determined by us, or by CMS or state agencies, to be ineligible for any government-sponsored program or to belong to a plan other than ours. Additionally, the verification of membership may result in additional premiums due to us from CMS and state agencies for individuals who were subsequently determined to belong to our plan for periods in which we received no premium for those members. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments and adjust premium revenue based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. We record amounts receivable in premiums receivable, net and amounts payable in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Supplemental Medicaid Premiums We earn supplemental premium payments for eligible obstetric deliveries and newborns of our Medicaid members in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. Effective January 1, 2017, we are also eligible to receive these supplemental premiums in Nebraska. Each state Medicaid contract specifies how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid. We also earn supplemental Medicaid premium payments in some states for high cost drugs and other eligible services. We recognize supplemental premium revenue in the period we provide related services to our members. Medicaid Risk-Adjusted Premiums In some instances, our Medicaid premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the health profile of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the state agency's analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's Medicaid membership. The frequency of when states adjust premiums varies, but is usually done quarterly or semi-annually on a retrospective basis. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured. 70 Table of Contents Medicaid ACA Industry Fee Reimbursement The ACA imposed certain new taxes and fees including an annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment on health insurers, which began in 2014. We received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee attributable to our Medicaid programs, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. Consequently, we recognized $244.9 million , $219.2 million and $124.6 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Medicare Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS provides risk-adjusted payments for MA Plans and PDPs based on the demographics and health severity of enrollees. The risk-adjusted premiums we receive are based on claims and encounter data that we submit to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience, or other data, and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured, which is possible as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS, when the ultimate adjustment settlements are received from CMS or we receive notification of such settlement amounts. CMS adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retrospective basis. The first retrospective adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year. This initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retrospective risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We populate our models with available risk score data on our members and base risk premium adjustments on risk score data from the previous year. We are not privy to risk score data for members new to our plans in the current plan year; therefore, we include assumptions regarding these members' risk scores. We periodically revise our estimates of risk-adjusted premiums as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjust our estimates to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. As a result of the variability of factors that determine our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums, the actual amount of the CMS retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates and could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We record any changes in estimates in current operations as adjustments to premium revenue. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately received. The data provided to CMS to determine members' risk scores is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, future refunds could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which CMS determines a refund is required and could be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Minimum Medical Expense and Risk Corridor Provisions We may be required to refund certain premium revenue to state agencies and CMS under various contractual and plan arrangements. We estimate the effect of these arrangements during each reporting period and reflect any adjustments to premium revenues in current operations. We report the estimated net amounts due to state agencies and CMS in other payables to government partners in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of our Medicaid contracts require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical benefits expense. To the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical benefits, we are required to refund to the state all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical benefits expense. We estimate the amounts due to the state agencies as a return of premium based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between our recorded estimates and the subsequent state agencies settlement amounts. Our MA and PDP premiums are subject to risk sharing through the CMS Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. The risk corridor calculation compares our actual experience to the target amount of prescription drug costs, limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by CMS, less rebates included in our submitted plan year bid. We receive additional premium from CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% above the target amount. We refund premiums to CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% below the target amount. Based on the risk corridor provision and PDP activity-to-date, an estimated risk-sharing receivable or payable is recorded as an adjustment to premium revenue. After the close of the annual plan year, CMS performs the risk corridor calculation and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between the subsequent CMS settlement amount and our recorded estimates. 71 Table of Contents Beginning in 2014, the ACA required the establishment of a minimum medical loss ratio ( MLR ) for MA plans and Part D plans, requiring them to spend not less than 85% of premiums on medical benefits. The rules implementing the minimum MLR impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum MLR, including requirements to refund to CMS shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan MA contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum MLR. MLR is determined by adding a plan spending for clinical services, prescription drugs and other direct patient benefits, plus its total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums (after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees). These provisions did not have a material effect on our results of operations in 2016, 2015 or 2014. A summary of other net payables to government partners is as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2016 2015 Liability to states under Medicaid minimum medical expense provisions $ (105.9 ) $ (32.9 ) Liability to CMS under risk corridor provision (190.5 ) (136.8 ) Liability to CMS under MA/PDP minimum MLR provisions of the ACA (0.3 ) (3.0 ) Net payables to government partners (1) $ (296.7 ) $ (172.7 ) (1) The components of net payables to government partners are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as $6.5 million and $303.2 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, and $172.7 million in current liabilities as of December 31, 2015. Medicare Part D Subsidies For qualifying low income PDP members, CMS pays for some, or all, of the member's monthly premium. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. Approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year, or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy, a settlement payment is made between CMS and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience. The subsidy components under Part D are described below. Low-Income Cost Sharing Subsidy ("LICS") - For qualifying low income members, CMS reimburses us for all or a portion of the low income member's deductible, coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold. Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy - CMS reimburses plans for 80% of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out-of-pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. Coverage Gap Discount Subsidy ("CGDS") - CMS provides monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members. Catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and the LICS represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. We are fully reimbursed by CMS for costs incurred for these contract elements and, accordingly, there is no insurance risk to us. Therefore, amounts received for these subsidies are not considered premium revenue, and are reported, net of the subsidy benefits paid, as Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. The receipts and payments between us and CMS are presented on a net basis as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows since we are essentially administering and paying the benefit subsidies on behalf of CMS. Historically, the settlement payments between us and CMS have not been materially different from our estimates. Growth in our PDP and MA membership and high drug unit costs in 2014 resulted in higher benefit payments made on behalf of CMS compared with our bids and compared with prior years, as well as an increase in the CMS risk corridor receivable. Based on our experience in 2014, our 2015 PDP and MA bids reflected significantly higher estimates for cash outflows for the government's responsibility of the Part D benefit plan design, particularly for the catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. However, the level of subsidy payments we made on behalf of CMS compared with our 2015 bids was still significant due to the composition of our 2015 PDP membership, which reflected a higher number of dual-eligible members relative to our overall membership. In November 2016, we received a $556.3 million settlement payment from CMS relating primarily to the LICS and catastrophic reinsurance cost reimbursements for the 2015 Part D plan year, which resulted in a meaningful reduction in our CMS Part D receivable included in our funds receivable for the benefit of members balance. 72 Table of Contents CGDS advance payments are recorded within Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are set up for manufacturer-invoiced amounts. Manufacturer payments reduce the receivable as payments are received. After the end of the contract year, during the Medicare Part D Payment reconciliation process for the CGD, CMS will perform a cost-based reconciliation to ensure the Medicare Part D sponsor is paid for gap discounts advanced at the point of sale, based on accepted prescription drug event data. For a further description of the revenue elements related to our segments, see Part I - Item 1 - Business - OUR PRODUCT SEGMENTS . Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable The cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical benefits incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). Medical benefits expense includes direct medical expenses and certain medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians, pharmacy benefit managers and providers of ancillary services. Recorded direct medical expenses are reduced by the amount of pharmacy rebates earned, which are estimated based on historical utilization of specific pharmaceuticals, current utilization and contract terms. Pharmacy rebates earned but not yet received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are included in pharmacy rebates receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Direct medical expenses may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Also, included in direct medical expense are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing arrangements. Consistent with the criteria specified and defined in guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") for costs that qualify to be reported as medical benefits under the minimum MLR provision of the ACA, we record certain medically-related administrative costs such as preventive health and wellness, care management, and other quality improvement costs, as medical benefits expense. All other medically-related administrative costs, such as utilization review services, network and provider credentialing and claims handling costs, are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense. Medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR. Our estimate of IBNR is the most significant estimate included in our consolidated financial statements. We determine our best estimate of the base liability for IBNR utilizing consistent standard actuarial methodologies based upon key assumptions, which vary by business segment. Our assumptions include current payment experience, trend factors and completion factors. Trend factors in our standard actuarial methodologies include contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefit changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business, changes in membership and other factors. The following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable: December 31, 2016 % of Total December 31, 2015 % of Total (In millions) IBNR $ 1,141.9 68% $ 1,187.9 77% Other medical benefits payable 548.6 32% 348.1 23% Total medical benefits payable $ 1,690.5 100% $ 1,536.0 100% The factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable claims payment patterns and 73 Table of Contents trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months' utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. External factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may affect medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing changes may affect our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2016 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2016 were decreased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would increase by approximately $141.7 million. If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would decrease by approximately $138.5 million. After determining an estimate of the base liability for IBNR, we make an additional estimate, also using standard actuarial techniques, to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than the estimated base reserve. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. Our estimate of the provision for moderately adverse conditions captures the potential adverse development from factors such as: our entry into new geographical markets; our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled; variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical costs, including higher drug costs; changes in provider reimbursement arrangements; variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment and the severity of claims; and health epidemics or outbreaks of disease such as the flu or enterovirus. We consider the base actuarial model liability and the provision for moderately adverse conditions as part of our overall assessment of our IBNR estimate to properly reflect the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states. Changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. Differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as prior year developments, are recorded in the period when such differences become known and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense in such periods. 74 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 1,536.0 $ 1,483.8 $ 953.4 Acquisitions (divestitures) 37.3 (9.5 ) 107.0 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current year 12,374.1 12,189.5 11,481.4 Prior year (284.7 ) (211.0 ) (26.2 ) Total 12,089.4 11,978.5 11,455.2 Medical benefits paid related to: Current year (10,925.0 ) (10,763.0 ) (10,089.6 ) Prior year (1,047.2 ) (1,153.8 ) (942.2 ) Total (11,972.2 ) (11,916.8 ) (11,031.8 ) Balances as of end of year $ 1,690.5 $ 1,536.0 $ 1,483.8 Medical benefits payable recorded developed favorably by approximately $284.7 million , $211.0 million and $26.2 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. A portion of the prior year development was attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, which is included as part of the assumptions. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year. Accordingly, the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the Medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period. Excluding the prior year development related to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, our estimates of medical benefits expense recorded developed favorably by approximately $154.3 million and $78.1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and unfavorably by $48.1 million in 2014 . Such amounts are net of the development relating to refunds due to government customers with minimum loss ratio provisions. The favorable development recognized in 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization in our Medicaid Health Plans segment, and to a lesser extent, our Medicare Health Plans segment. The unfavorable development in 2014 was due to higher than expected medical services in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plan segments that were not discernible until the effect became clearer over time as claim payments were processed. Premium Deficiency Reserves We evaluate our contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. We establish a premium deficiency reserve ("PDR") when it is probable that expected future medical benefits and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and reinsurance recoveries for the remainder of a contract period. For purposes of determining a PDR, we do not consider investment income and contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. A PDR is recorded as medical benefits expense and in medical benefits payable. Once established, a PDR is reduced over the contract period as an offset to actual losses. We re-evaluate our PDR estimates each reporting period and, if estimated future losses differ from those in the current PDR estimate, we adjust the liability through medical benefits expense, as necessary. We had no PDR liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 75 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions typically result in goodwill, which represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units, which we determined to be the same as our operating segments. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2016 was $392.5 million compared with $263.2 million at December 31, 2015. Goodwill attributable to our Medicaid reporting unit was $282.1 million and $152.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Goodwill attributable to our MA reporting unit was $110.4 million at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. Medicaid Health Plans goodwill, as of December 31, 2016, includes approximately $102.7 million of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of Care1st Arizona effective on December 31, 2016. We anticipate that goodwill will be allocated to the Medicare Health Plans segment and/or certain acquired intangible assets upon completion of our valuation procedures. Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions and Divestitures , included in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Care1st acquisition. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it would be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Such events or circumstances could include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, among others. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we compare an estimate of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the applicable goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test based on our financial position and results of operations as of June 30 of each year, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting and planning process. The annual impairment tests are based on an evaluation of estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimated discounted cash flows are based on the best information available to us at the time, including supportable assumptions and projections we believe are reasonable. Our discounted cash flow estimates use discount rates that correspond to a weighted-average cost of capital consistent with a market-participant view. The discount rates are consistent with those used for investment decisions and take into account the operating plans and strategies of our operating segments. Certain other key assumptions utilized, including changes in membership, premium, health care costs, operating expenses, fees, assessments and taxes and effective tax rates, are based on estimates consistent with those utilized in our annual budgeting and planning process that we believe are reasonable. However, if we do not achieve the results reflected in the assumptions and estimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion of our goodwill, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment. Impairments, if any, would be classified as an operating expense. Based on the results of our annual impairment testing in 2016, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no further goodwill impairment assessment was necessary. Other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions include provider networks, broker networks, trademarks, state contracts, non-compete agreements, licenses and permits. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our intangible assets. Such events and changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, federal and state government contracts and provider networks. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If these assets are determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. During 2016 and 2015, no events or circumstances have occurred, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our other intangible assets. Accordingly, there were no impairment losses recognized during 2016 or 2015. During 2014, we recognized impairments totaling approximately $19.7 million relating to the partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of Easy Choice Health Plan, Inc. and the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the purchase of certain assets from a small health plan in 2012.
