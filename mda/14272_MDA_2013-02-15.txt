Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which may be referred to as Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS, the Company, we, our or us) is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. We license, manufacture, market, distribute and sell pharmaceutical products on a global basis. The following key events and transactions occurred during 2012 as discussed in further detail in the Strategy, Product and Pipeline Developments and Results of Operations sections of Management Discussion and Analysis: Our net sales and earnings declined as a result of the loss of exclusivity of Plavix * (clopidogrel bisulfate) and Avapro* / Avalide* (irbesartan/irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide). We received significant regulatory approvals pertaining to Eliquis (apixaban) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), Forxiga (dapagliflozin) and the Orencia (abatacept) subcutaneous formulation. We acquired Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Amylin) and expanded our diabetes alliance arrangement with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) to include Amylin-related products. We discontinued the development of BMS-986094 (formerly INX-189), a compound which we acquired as part of our acquisition of Inhibitex, Inc. (Inhibitex) to treat hepatitis C virus infection, in the interest of patient safety, which resulted in a $1.8 billion pre-tax impairment charge. Highlights The following table is a summary of our financial highlights: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2012 2011 2010 Net Sales $ 17,621 $ 21,244 $ 19,484 Total Expenses 15,281 14,263 13,413 Earnings before Income Taxes 2,340 6,981 6,071 Provision for/(Benefit from) Income Taxes (161) 1,721 1,558 Effective tax/(benefit) rate (6.9)% 24.7 % 25.7 % Net Earnings Attributable to BMS GAAP 1,960 3,709 3,102 Non-GAAP 3,364 3,921 3,735 Diluted Earnings Per Share GAAP 1.16 2.16 1.79 Non-GAAP 1.99 2.28 2.16 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 6,352 11,642 9,982 Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude specified items which represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. For a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Business Environment The pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect sales of our products, including product efficacy, safety, price, demand, competition and cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; market access; product labeling; quality control and quality assurance of our manufacturing operations; and research and development of new products. To successfully compete in the healthcare industry, we must demonstrate that our products offer medical benefits and cost advantages. Our new product introductions often compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. We manufacture branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of our leading challenges. 37 In the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during its market exclusivity period. Afterwards, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, we can experience a significant reduction of that product sales in a short period of time. Competitors seeking approval of biological products under a full Biologics License Application (BLA) must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, involving more complex processes and costs than those of other pharmaceutical operations. Under the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010, there is an abbreviated path for regulatory approval of generic versions of biological products. This path for approval of biosimilar products under the U.S. healthcare legislation significantly affects the regulatory data exclusivity for biological products. The legislation provides a regulatory mechanism allowing for regulatory approval of biologic drugs similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than required by a full BLA. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the impact of the U.S. biosimilar legislation on the Company. Globally, the healthcare industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that will continue to impact our net sales. In March 2010, the U.S. government enacted healthcare reform legislation, signing into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) and a reconciliation bill containing a package of changes to the healthcare bill. We will continue to experience additional financial costs and certain other changes to our business as healthcare law provisions become effective. The aggregate financial impact of U.S. healthcare reform over the next few years depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to pending implementation guidance, potential changes in sales volume eligible for the new rebates, discounts or fees, and the impact of cost sharing arrangements with certain alliance partners. Our future net sales beginning in 2014 could potentially be positively impacted from the expected increase in the number of people with healthcare coverage from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups exerting downward pressure on pricing. For example, pricing freedom is limited in the UK by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Many European countries have continuing fiscal challenges as healthcare payers, including government agencies, have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the cost of healthcare through actions that directly or indirectly impose additional price restrictions. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products as more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines are available in some countries. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. significantly impacted competition in the healthcare industry. MCOs seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants through volume purchases and long-term contractual discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs is an important part of our strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in MCO formularies and we generally are successful in having our key products included. We believe that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, continue to have a downward pressure on prices. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely by product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity is usually a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become a larger percentage of our product portfolio, we will continue to maintain supply arrangements with third-party manufacturers and incur substantial investments to increase our internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. The FDA approved our large scale multi-product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts in May 2012. We maintain a competitive position in the market and strive to uphold this position, depending on our success in discovering, developing and delivering innovative, cost-effective products to help patients prevail over serious diseases. We are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the final outcomes of these investigations or litigations. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy Over the past few years, we transformed our Company into a focused biopharmaceutical company. We continue to focus on sustaining our business and building a foundation for the future by growing our newer key marketed products, advancing our pipeline portfolio and managing our costs. We expect that our portfolio will become increasingly diversified across products and geographies over the next few years. 38 We experienced substantial exclusivity losses this year for Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* , which together had more than $8 billion of net sales in 2011. We had been preparing for this for a number of years. As expected, we experienced a rapid, precipitous, and material decline in Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* net sales and a reduction in net income and operating cash flow. Such events are the norm in the industry when companies experience the loss of exclusivity of a significant product. We will also face additional exclusivity losses in the coming years. We also face significant challenges with an increasingly complex global and regulatory environment and global economic uncertainty, particularly in the European Union (EU). We believe our strategy to grow our newer marketed products and our robust research and development (R&D) pipeline, particularly within the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology, cardiovascular/metabolic disease and virology, position us well for the future. We continue to expand our biologics capabilities. We still rely significantly on small molecules as our strongest, most reliable starting point for discovering potential new medicines, but large molecules or biologics, derived from recombinant DNA technologies are becoming increasingly important. Currently, more than 40% of our pipeline compounds are biologics, as are four of our key marketed products, including Yervoy (ipilimumab). We also continue to support our pipeline with our licensing and acquisitions strategy, referred to as our string of pearls. During the third quarter of 2012, we acquired Amylin, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines for patients with diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Following the completion of our acquisition of Amylin, we entered into a collaboration with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, which builds upon our existing alliance, further expanding our collaboration strategy. We are currently integrating the Amylin business into our development, manufacturing and commercial operations. We are also seeking to build relationships with academic organizations that have innovative programs and capabilities that complement our own internal efforts. Product and Pipeline Developments We manage our research and development (R&D) programs on a portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage of research and development from early discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. We consider our R&D programs that have entered into Phase III development to be significant, as these programs constitute our late-stage development pipeline. These Phase III development programs include both investigational compounds in Phase III development for initial indications and marketed products that are in Phase III development for additional indications or formulations. Spending on these programs represents approximately 30-40% of our annual R&D expenses. No individual investigational compound or marketed product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years. While we do not expect all of our late-stage development programs to make it to market, our late-stage development programs are the R&D programs that could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years. The following are the recent significant developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline: Eliquis an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, targeted at stroke prevention in NVAF and the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disorders. Eliquis is part of our strategic alliance with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) In December 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Eliquis to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF. Eliquis also received regulatory approval for this indication in Japan and Canada in December 2012, in the EU in November 2012, and in South Korea in January 2013. In December 2012, the Company announced the results of the Phase III AMPLIFY-EXT trial, which evaluated treatment with Eliquis compared to placebo over a one year period for the prevention of recurrent VTE in 2,486 patients who had already completed six to 12 months of anticoagulation treatment for VTE, including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. In the trial, extended treatment with Eliquis 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily, demonstrated superiority versus placebo in the reduction of the composite endpoint of symptomatic, recurrent VTE and death from any cause. Eliquis also was superior to placebo for the predefined secondary efficacy outcome of recurrent VTE and VTE-related death. The rate of the primary safety outcome of major bleeding was comparable across treatment groups. In October 2012, the Company announced in a publication in The Lancet that the reductions in stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding and mortality demonstrated with Eliquis compared to warfarin in the ARISTOTLE trial were consistent across a wide range of stroke and bleeding risk scores in patients with NVAF. In March 2012, additional analyses from the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES clinical trials were presented at the American College of Cardiology 61st Annual Scientific Session. Forxiga an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes that is part of our alliance with AstraZeneca In November 2012, the EC approved Forxiga for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the EU. 39 In June 2012, at the 72 nd American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, the Company and AstraZeneca announced results from a Phase III clinical study that showed Forxiga 10 mg demonstrated significant reductions in blood sugar levels (glycosylated hemoglobin levels, or HbA1c) compared with placebo at 24 weeks when either agent was added to existing sitagliptin therapy (with or without metformin) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. The results were maintained over a 24-week extension and similar results were observed when the data were stratified by background therapy. The study also demonstrated significant reductions in total body weight and fasting plasma glucose levels in patients taking Forxiga added to sitigliptin (with or without metformin), with results maintained throughout the duration of the study. In January 2012, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the NDA for dapagliflozin. The CRL requests additional clinical data to allow a better assessment of the benefit-risk profile for dapagliflozin. The companies will continue to work closely with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for the dapagliflozin application, and are in ongoing discussions with health authorities in other countries as part of the application procedures. The Company has met with the FDA and now has a path forward for potential approval for Forxiga in the U.S. The Company will provide additional data from ongoing studies to the FDA and expects to be able to resubmit the NDA for Forxiga in mid-2013. At this time, the Company expects that the FDA will have a six month period in which to review the resubmission and will hold an Advisory Committee meeting. Hepatitis C Portfolio (Peginterferon lambda a novel and potential first-in-class type 3 interferon in development; Daclatasvir a NS5A replication complex inhibitor in development; Asunaprevir a NS3 protease inhibitor in development) In November 2012, the Company announced the results of the global, D-LITE Phase IIb study, in which a 24-week regimen combining the investigational compound peginterferon lambda-1a with the investigational direct-acting antiviral (DAA) daclatasvir and ribavirin, achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment of treatment-na ve, genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C virus infection patients who achieved a protocol-defined response In November 2012, the Company announced Phase II data demonstrating that the 12-week Triple DAA treatment regime of daclatasvir, asunaprevir, and BMS-791325 (an NS5B non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor) achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment in 94% of treatment na ve, genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection patients. In November 2012, the Company announced Phase II data demonstrating that the dual regiment of daclatasvir and asunaprevir, without interferon or ribavarin, achieved high rates of sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment in patients with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus infections who were prior null responders to alfa interferon and ribavarin. Elotuzumab an anti-CS1 antibody under investigation for the treatment of multiple myeloma In December 2012, the Company announced the results of a small, randomized Phase II study in patients with previously treated myeloma. Two doses were tested, 10mg/kg and 20 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. In the 10 mg/kg arm, median progression-free survival (PFS), or the time without disease progression or death, was not reached after 20.8 months of follow up (N=36) and the objective response rate (ORR) was 92%. Of patients who received elotuzumab at a dose of 20 mg/kg, median PFS was 18.6 months (N=37) and ORR was 76%. Necitumumab a novel targeted cancer therapy for non-small cell lung cancer In November 2012, we provided notice of the termination of our global codevelopment and cocommercialization arrangement for necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated as an anticancer treatment, which was discovered by ImClone and was part of the alliance between the Company and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), with all rights returning to Lilly. The termination is effective May 2014, though we and Lilly may terminate earlier. Sustiva (efavirenz) a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV. In February 2013, the Company announced that the FDA has granted an additional six-month period of exclusivity to market Sustiva . Exclusivity for Sustiva in the U.S. is now scheduled to expire in March 2015. Baraclude (entecavir) an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B In February 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidated the composition of matter patent covering Baraclude , which was scheduled to expire in 2015. In October 2012, a labeling update for Baraclude was approved by the FDA to include data on African Americans and liver transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 40 Erbitux* (cetuximab) a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. Erbitux* is part of our alliance with Lilly. In July 2012, the FDA granted full approval of Erbitux* in combination with the chemotherapy regimen folfiri (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin) for the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS mutation-negative epidermal growth factor receptor-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer as determined by FDA-approved tests for the use. In April 2012, the FDA issued a CRL regarding the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) in first-line non-small cell lung cancer which stated that, based on the current data package, the first-line indication for Erbitux* in combination with vinorelbine and cisplatin is not approvable. Lilly and the Company do not plan to resubmit the filing. Yervoy (ipilimumab) a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic melanoma In November 2012, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended Yervoy , which is approved in the EU for the treatment for previously, treated metastatic (advanced) melanoma, within the Final Appraisal Determination. This important recommendation will enable eligible patients in England and Wales to routinely access treatment with Yervoy through the National Health Services. In September 2012, the Company announced at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2012 Congress long-term follow-up data of the 024 study which evaluated newly-diagnosed patients treated with Yervoy 10mg/kg in combination with dacarbazine versus dacarbazine alone and five-year follow-up data from the rollover 025 study which evaluated patients with Yervoy 0.3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. The survival rates observed in study 024 at years three and four were not only stable but higher in patients treated with Yervoy plus dacarbazine versus patients who received dacarbazine alone. The estimated survival rates in the 025 study remained unchanged or relatively stable at five years compared to four years in newly-diagnosed patients and previously-diagnosed patients. Orencia a fusion protein indicated for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) In October 2012, the EC granted marketing authorization for a subcutaneous formulation of Orencia in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adults. In June 2012, at the European League Against Rheumatism Annual European Congress of Rheumatology, the Company announced that AMPLE, a head-to-head trial of 646 patients comparing the subcutaneous formulation of Orencia vs. Humira* (adalimumab), each on a background of methotrexate (MTX), in biologic na ve patients with moderate to severe RA met its primary endpoint (as measured by non-inferiority) demonstrating that Orencia plus MTX achieved comparable rates of efficacy for the American College of Rheumatology criteria of 20 percent (ACR 20) response at one year of 64.8% vs. 63.4% Humira* plus MTX. In May 2012, the Company announced that the FDA had approved the Company biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts for commercial production of Orencia . Nulojix (belatacept) a fusion protein with novel immunosuppressive activity for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection In June 2012, at the 2012 American Transplant Congress, the Company announced new four-year results from the long-term extensions (LTE) of the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT clinical trials of Nulojix , the first T-cell costimulation blocker indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult Epstein-Barr Virus seropositive patients receiving a kidney transplant, in combination with basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. Results showed that the safety profile of Nulojix through year four was consistent compared with results at year three with no new safety signals being identified, and that the renal function benefit versus cyclosporine was maintained through four years in patients enrolled in the LTE from both the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT trials. Onglyza/Kombiglyze (saxagliptin/once daily combination of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release) a treatment for type 2 diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca In July 2012, the Company and AstraZeneca announced at the 17 th World Congress on Heart Disease the results of analyses showing that Onglyza 5mg demonstrated improvements across key measures of blood sugar control (glycosylated hemoglobin levels, or HbA1c; fasting plasma glucose, or FPG and post-prandial glucose, or PPG) compared to placebo in adult patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition, in August 2012, the Company discontinued development of BMS-986094. This decision was made in the interest of patient safety. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 13. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information. 41 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales The composition of the changes in net sales was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales Analysis of % Change Analysis of % Change Total Foreign Total Foreign Dollars in Millions 2012 2011 2010 Change Volume Price Exchange Change Volume Price Exchange United States (a) $ 10,384 $ 14,039 $ 12,800 (26)% (30)% 4% 10% 3% 7% Europe (b) 3,706 3,879 3,672 (4)% 6% (3)% (7)% 6% 5% (4)% 5% Rest of the World (c) 3,204 3,237 2,900 (1)% 2% (1)% (2)% 12% 8% (2)% 6% Other (d) 327 89 112 ** N/A N/A (21)% N/A N/A Total $ 17,621 $ 21,244 $ 19,484 (17)% (17)% 2% (2)% 9% 4% 3% 2% (a) Includes Puerto Rico. (b) Includes Russia and Turkey. (c) Includes Japan, China, Canada, Australia and Brazil, among other countries. (d) Includes royalty-related revenues and sales attributed to supply agreements. ** Change in excess of 100%. The change in U.S. net sales in 2012 attributed to volume reflects the recent exclusivity losses of Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* , partially offset by increased demand for most key products and the addition of Byetta* , Bydureon* , and Symlin* following the completion of our acquisition of Amylin ($262 million). The change in U.S. net sales in 2011 attributed to volume reflects the launch of Yervoy and increased demand for several key products partially offset by decreased prescription demand for Avapro* / Avalide* and Plavix* . The change in U.S. net sales attributed to price in both periods was a result of higher average net selling prices for Plavix* and Abilify* partially offset by the reduction in our contractual share of Abilify* net sales from 58% to 53.5% in 2011 and a further reduction to 51.5% in 2012, and higher rebates and discounts resulting from U.S. healthcare reform legislation in 2011. See Key Products for further discussion of sales by key product. Net sales in Europe decreased in 2012 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange and lower sales of certain mature brands from divestitures and generic competition as well as generic competition for Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* partially offset by sales growth of most key products. Net sales in Europe increased in 2011 as favorable foreign exchange and sales growth of most key products more than offset the previously mentioned lower sales of certain mature brands and generic competition for Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* . Net sales in both periods were negatively impacted by continuing fiscal challenges in many European countries as healthcare payers, including government agencies, have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the cost of healthcare through actions that directly or indirectly impose additional price reductions. These measures include, but are not limited to, mandatory discounts, rebates, other price reductions and other restrictive measures. Net sales in the Rest of the World decreased in 2012 as growth in certain key products in Japan, China, and South Korea was more than offset by generic competition for Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide*, the timing of government purchases in certain countries and lower sales of mature brands from generic competition and divestitures. Net sales in the Rest of the World increased in 2011 primarily due to growth in certain key products in Japan, China and South Korea and favorable foreign exchange, which were partially offset by generic competition for Avapro* / Avalide* and lower sales of mature brands from generic competition and divestitures. Other net sales increased in 2012 because of enhanced royalty-related revenues and higher sales attributed to active pharmaceutical ingredients supply agreements resulting from recent divestitures of manufacturing facilities and restructured alliance agreements. Other net sales are expected to continue to increase in 2013 as a result of higher royalties and alliance revenue attributed to the restructured Sanofi agreement and new mature/over-the-counter brands collaborative agreements. No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 or 2010. In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Estimated End-User Demand below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of our key products. U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer. 42 Revenue is reduced for and presented net of gross-to-net sales adjustments that are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. The reconciliation of gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments was as follows: Year Ended December 31, % Change Dollars in Millions 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Gross Sales $ 19,816 $ 24,007 $ 21,681 (17)% 11% Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Charge-Backs Related to Government Programs (651) (767) (605) (15)% 27% Cash Discounts (192) (282) (255) (32)% 11% Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (284) (752) (499) (62)% 51% Medicaid Rebates (386) (536) (453) (28)% 18% Sales Returns (248) (76) (88) 226% (14)% Other Adjustments (434) (350) (297) 24% 18% Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (2,195) (2,763) (2,197) (21)% 26% Net Sales $ 17,621 $ 21,244 $ 19,484 (17)% 9% The activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales reserve adjustments were as follows: Dollars in Millions Charge-Backs Related to Government Programs Cash Discounts Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Sales Returns Other Adjustments Total Balance at January 1, 2011 $ 48 $ 29 $ 216 $ 327 $ 187 $ 127 $ 934 Provision related to sales made in current period 767 282 752 541 120 357 2,819 Provision related to sales made in prior periods (5 ) (44 ) (7 ) (56 ) Returns and payments (764 ) (283 ) (550 ) (452 ) (101 ) (296 ) (2,446 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (1 ) (1 ) (2 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 $ 51 $ 28 $ 417 $ 411 $ 161 $ 181 $ 1,249 Provision related to sales made in current period 651 191 351 423 256 451 2,323 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 1 (67 ) (37 ) (8 ) (17 ) (128 ) Returns and payments (663 ) (208 ) (561 ) (459 ) (88 ) (435 ) (2,414 ) Amylin acquisition 2 1 34 13 23 3 76 Impact of foreign currency translation 1 1 2 Balance at December 31, 2012 $ 41 $ 13 $ 175 $ 351 $ 345 $ 183 $ 1,108 Gross-to-net sales adjustment rates are primarily a function of changes in sales mix and contractual and legislative discounts and rebates. Gross-to-net sales adjustments decreased in 2012 and increased in 2011 due to: All gross-to-net adjustment categories other than sales returns and other adjustments decreased in 2012 as a result of lower Plavix* sales following its loss of exclusivity. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts also decreased in 2012 due to a $67 million reduction in the estimated amount of Medicare Part D coverage gap discounts attributable to prior period rebates after receiving actual invoices and the nonrenewal of Plavix* contract discounts in the Medicare Part D program as of January 1, 2012. These rebates and discounts increased in 2011 due to the 50% discount for patients within the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Medicaid rebates also decreased in 2012 due to a $37 million reduction in the estimated amount of managed Medicaid rebates attributable to prior periods after receiving actual invoices. In 2011, Medicaid rebates increased due to the full year impact of the expansion of rebates for drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans, higher average net selling prices for Plavix* and higher Medicaid channel sales. The provision for sales returns increased as a result of the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of Plavix* in May 2012 and Avapro* / Avalide* in March 2012. The U.S. sales return reserves for these products at December 31, 2012 were $173 million and determined after considering several factors including estimated inventory levels in the distribution channels. In accordance with Company policy, these products are eligible to be returned between six months prior to and 12 months after product expiration. Additional adjustments to these reserves might be required in the future for revised estimates to various assumptions including actual returns which are generally not expected to occur until 2014. In 2011, sales returns included a $29 million reduction of a $44 million U.S. return reserve established in 2010 in connection with a recall of certain lots of Avalide* due to lower returns than expected. Other adjustments increased in 2012 as a result of co-pay and coupon programs. Although not presented as a gross-to-net adjustment in the above tables, our contractual share of Abilify* and Atripla* gross-to-net sales adjustments were approximately $1.5 billion in 2012, $1.3 billion in 2011 and $1.0 billion in 2010. These increases were primarily attributed to additional rebates and discounts required under U.S. healthcare reform. 43 Key Products Net sales of key products represented 84% of total net sales in 2012, 86% in 2011 and 84% in 2010. The following table presents U.S. and international net sales by key product, the percentage change from the prior period and the foreign exchange impact when compared to the prior period.

Plavix * a platelet aggregation inhibitor that is part of our alliance with Sanofi U.S. net sales decreased in 2012 and will continue to decrease in 2013 due to the loss of exclusivity in May 2012. U.S. net sales increased in 2011 primarily due to higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased 60% in 2012 and 5% in 2011. International net sales continue to be negatively impacted by generic clopidogrel products in the EU, Canada, and Australia. Avapro*/Avalide* (known in the EU as Aprovel*/Karvea* ) an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the Sanofi alliance U.S. net sales decreased in 2012 due to the loss of exclusivity in March 2012 and decreased in 2011 due to market share losses subsequent to the Avalide* supply shortage in the first quarter of 2011 associated with previously reported recalls. The decrease in U.S. net sales in 2011 was partially offset by higher average net selling prices and estimated returns. Total estimated U.S. prescription demand decreased 71% in 2012 and 39% in 2011. International net sales decreased in both periods due to lower demand including generic competition in certain EU markets and Canada. Eliquis an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, targeted at stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and the prevention and treatment of VTE disorders. Eliquis is part of our strategic alliance with Pfizer. Eliquis was approved in the U.S. for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF in December 2012. Eliquis was approved in the EU for VTE prevention in May 2011 and was launched in a limited number of EU countries beginning in May 2011. Eliquis was also approved in the EU for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF in November 2012. Eliquis was approved in December 2012 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for the prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF. Abilify * an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka U.S. net sales increased in 2012 due to higher average net selling prices and a $62 million reduction in BMS share in the estimated amount of customer rebates and discounts attributable to 2011 based on actual invoices received that were partially offset by fluctuations in retail buying patterns. U.S. net sales increased in 2011 due to higher overall demand and higher average net selling prices. U.S. net sales in both periods were negatively impacted by the reduction in our contractual share of net sales from 58.0% in 2010 to 53.5% in 2011 to 51.5% in 2012 and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted in 2013 as a result of a further reduction in BMS contractual share of Abilify* net sales (estimated at approximately 35%). Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 1% in 2012 and 5% in 2011. International net sales increased in both periods primarily due to higher demand. International net sales were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in 2012 and favorable foreign exchange in 2011. Reyataz a protease inhibitor for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) U.S. net sales increased in 2012 due to higher average net selling prices. Estimated total prescription demand decreased 5% in 2012 and increased 2% in 2011. 45 International net sales decreased in 2012 due to unfavorable foreign exchange, the timing of government purchases in certain countries and lower demand resulting from competing products. International net sales increased in 2011 due to higher demand. Sustiva Franchise a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes Sustiva , an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, Atripla* (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a product sold through our joint venture with Gilead U.S. net sales increased in both periods primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased 1% in 2012 and increased 7% in 2011. International net sales decreased in 2012 due to unfavorable foreign exchange. International net sales in 2011 increased primarily due to higher demand. Baraclude an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B Net sales in both periods increased primarily due to higher demand. We may experience a rapid and significant decline in U.S. net sales beginning in 2013 due to possible generic competition following a federal court decision in February 2013 invalidating the composition of matter patent. Erbitux * a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. Erbitux * is part of our strategic alliance with Lilly. Sold by us almost exclusively in the U.S., net sales remained relatively flat in 2012 and increased in 2011 primarily due to higher demand. Sprycel an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including Gleevec * (imatinib meslylate) and first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. Sprycel is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka. U.S. net sales in both periods increased primarily due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 29% in 2012 and 30% in 2011. International net sales in both periods increased primarily due to higher demand. International net sales were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in 2012 and favorable foreign exchange in 2011. Demand in 2011 was positively impacted by the approval of Sprycel for first-line treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase in the U.S. and the EU in the fourth quarter of 2010. Yervoy a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic melanoma Yervoy net sales increased from higher demand since its launch in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2011 and continued launches in a number of international countries since the second quarter of 2011. Orencia a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as methotrexate or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy U.S. net sales increased in both periods primarily due to higher demand, including the launch of the Orencia subcutaneous formulation (SC) in the fourth quarter of 2011, and higher average net selling prices. International net sales increased in both periods primarily due to higher demand, including the launch of Orencia SC in certain European markets beginning in the second quarter of 2012. International net sales were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in 2012 and favorable foreign exchange in 2011. Nulojix a fusion protein with novel immunosuppressive activity targeted at prevention of kidney transplant rejection Nulojix was approved and launched in the U.S. and EU during 2011. Onglyza/Kombiglyze (known in the EU as Onglyza/Komboglyze ) a once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that is part of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca U.S. net sales of Onglyza/Kombiglyze increased in both periods primarily due to higher overall demand and higher average net selling prices in 2012. Kombiglyze was launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2010. International net sales increased in both periods primarily due to higher demand, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange in 2012. 46 Byetta * a twice daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes Byetta * net sales are included in our results following the completion of our acquisition of Amylin in the third quarter of 2012. Bydureon * a once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes Bydureon * was launched by Amylin in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2012 and in the EU in the second quarter of 2012. Net sales are included in our results following the completion of our acquisition of Amylin in the third quarter of 2012. Mature Products and All Other includes all other products, including those which have lost exclusivity in major markets, over-the-counter brands and royalty-related revenue U.S. net sales continued to decrease in 2012 from generic erosion of certain products which was partially offset by sales of Symlin * following the completion of our Amylin acquisition in the third quarter of 2012. International net sales decreased in both periods due to the continued generic erosion of certain brands and unfavorable foreign exchange in 2012. The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this report includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect product demand within other channels such as hospitals, home health care, clinics, federal facilities including Veterans Administration hospitals, and long-term care, among others. The data is provided by Wolters Kluwer Health (WK), except for Sprycel , and is based on the Source Prescription Audit. Sprycel demand is based upon information from the Next-Generation Prescription Service version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit provided by the IMS Health (IMS). The data is a product of each respective service providers own recordkeeping and projection processes and therefore subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error. We continuously seek to improve the quality of our estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand by reviewing the calculation methodologies employed and analyzing internal and third-party data. We expect to continue to review and refine our methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will monitor the quality of our own and third parties data used in such calculations. We calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied, compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the retail prescriptions. We believe that a calculation of estimated total U.S. prescription change based on this weighted-average approach provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand in retail and mail order channels. We use this methodology for our internal demand reporting. 47 Estimated End-User Demand The following tables set forth for each of our key products sold in the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: (i) change in reported U.S. net sales for each year; (ii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by us based on third-party data on a weighted-average basis, and (iii) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

The months on hand relates only to Sustiva . (b) Erbitux *, Yervoy and Nulojix are parenterally administered products and do not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write prescriptions for these products. (c) Orencia intravenous formulation is a parenterally administered product and does not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write prescriptions for this product. The Orencia subcutaneous formulation ( Orencia SC ) is not parenterally administered and was launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2011. Orencia SC sales were $201 million in 2012 and $15 million in 2011. (d) Yervoy and Nulojix were launched in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2011. (e) Byetta * and Bydureon * net sales are included in our results following the completion of our acquisition of Amylin in the third quarter of 2012. ** Change in excess of 100%. Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described below under SEC Consent Order , we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for these products were not material as of the dates indicated above. Below are U.S. products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at December 31, 2012, and international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2012. Plavix * had 1.3 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. compared to 0.5 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011 due to the loss of exclusivity in May 2012. We expect a gradual decrease in inventory on hand of Plavix* to occur over the next few years as product in the wholesale distribution channel continues to be worked down or returned. Levels of inventory on hand in the wholesale and retail distribution channels were considered in assessing the sales return reserves established as of December 31, 2012. Avapro*/Avalide* had 1.9 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. compared to 0.6 of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011 due to the loss of exclusivity in March 2012 and a one-time increase of $3 million of inventory in the wholesale and retail distribution channels corresponding with the transition of Avapro*/Avalide* manufacturing to Sanofi pursuant to the restructured agreement. Levels of inventory on hand in the wholesale and retail distribution channels were considered in assessing the sales return reserves established as of December 31, 2012. Dafalgan , an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 1.0 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to ordering patterns of pharmacists in France. 48 Fervex , a cold and flu product, had 2.9 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 5.3 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011. The level of inventory on hand decreased following the peak of flu season, with the remaining inventory on hand primarily attributable to ordering patterns of pharmacists in France. Luftal , an antacid product, had 1.5 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.9 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to government purchasing patterns in Brazil. In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, we generally determined our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. products, and provided by our distributors. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes. For our businesses outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of other methodologies to estimate such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2012 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Expenses % Change Dollar in Millions 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Cost of products sold $ 4,610 $ 5,598 $ 5,277 (18) % 6 % Marketing, selling and administrative 4,220 4,203 3,686 % 14 % Advertising and product promotion 797 957 977 (17) % (2) % Research and development 3,904 3,839 3,566 2 % 8 % Impairment charge for BMS-986094 intangible asset 1,830 N/ A N/ A Other (income)/expense (80 ) (334 ) (93 ) (76) % * * Total Expenses $ 15,281 $ 14,263 $ 13,413 7 % 6 % ** Change is in excess of 100%. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold consists of material costs, internal labor and overhead from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party processing costs, other supply chain costs and the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts that are used to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchase transactions. Essentially all of these costs are managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. Cost of products also includes royalties and profit sharing attributed to licensed products and alliances, amortization of acquired developed technology costs from business combinations and milestone payments that occur on or after regulatory approval. Cost of products sold can vary between periods as a result of product mix (particularly resulting from royalties and profit sharing expenses in connection with our alliances), price, inflation and costs attributed to the rationalization of manufacturing sites resulting in accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other stranded costs. In addition, changes in foreign currency may also provide volatility given a high percentage of total costs are denominated in foreign currencies. Cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales were 26.2% in 2012, 26.4% in 2011, and 27.1% in 2010. The decrease in cost of products sold in 2012 was primarily attributed to lower sales volume following the loss of exclusivity of Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* which resulted in lower royalties in connection with our Sanofi alliance and favorable foreign exchange partially offset by impairment charges discussed below and higher amortization costs resulting from the Amylin acquisition (net of the amortization of the Amylin collaboration proceeds). Impairment charges of $147 million were recognized in 2012, of which $120 million was related to a partial write-down to fair value of developed technology costs related to a non-key product ( Recothrom ) acquired in the acquisition of ZymoGenetics, Inc. (ZymoGenetics). The developed technology impairment charge resulted from continued competitive pricing pressures and a reduction 49 in the undiscounted projected cash flows to an amount less than the carrying value of the intangible asset. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset based on the discounted value of the estimated future cash flows and the carrying value of the intangible asset. The remaining $27 million impairment charge related to the abandonment of a manufacturing facility resulting from the outsourcing of a manufacturing process. The increase in 2011 was primarily attributable to higher sales volume resulting in additional royalties, collaboration fees, and profit sharing expense, and unfavorable foreign exchange. Marketing, selling and administrative Marketing, selling and administrative expenses consist of salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs and other expenses that are not attributed to product manufacturing costs or research and development expenses. These expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global corporate organizations such as finance, law, information technology and human resources. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased slightly in 2012 primarily as a result of the Amylin acquisition ($125 million, including $67 million related to the accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted stock units), partially offset by a reduction in sales-related activities for Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide*. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were also impacted by favorable foreign exchange. The increase in 2011 was attributed to the annual pharmaceutical company fee, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher marketing costs to support new launches and key products and to a lesser extent, higher bad debt expense in the EU, charitable funding and information technology expenses. The annual pharmaceutical company fee was $246 million in 2012 and $220 million in 2011. For further information regarding the annual pharmaceutical company fee, refer to Item 1. Business Government Regulation and Price Constraints. Advertising and product promotion Advertising and product promotion expenses consist of related media, sample and direct to consumer programs. The decrease in 2012 was primarily attributed to lower spending on the promotion of Plavix* , Avapro* / Avalide* , Abilify* , and certain mature brands in the U.S. to coincide with their product life cycle. Research and development Research and development expenses consist of salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies and facility costs. Total research and development expenses include the costs of discovery research, preclinical development, early- and late-clinical development and drug formulation, as well as clinical trials and medical support of marketed products, proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs, facilities, information technology, and employee stock compensation costs, and other appropriate costs. These expenses also include third-party licensing fees that are typically paid upfront as well as when regulatory or other contractual milestones are met. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Most expenses are managed by our global research and development organization of which, approximately $1.9 billion of the total spend was attributed to development activities with the remainder attributed to preclinical and research activities. These expenses can vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of upfront, milestone and other licensing payments. Research and development expenses increased in 2012 primarily from $60 million of expenses related to the Amylin acquisition (including $27 million related to the accelerated vesting of Amylin stock options and restricted stock units), partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and the net impact of upfront, milestone, and other licensing payments and IPRD impairment charges. Refer to Specified Items included in Non-GAAP Financial Measures for amounts attributed to each period. IPRD impairment charges relate to projects previously acquired in the Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) acquisition and Inhibitex acquisition (including $45 million in 2012 related to FV-100, a nucleoside inhibitor for the reduction of shingles-associated pain) resulting from unfavorable clinical trial results and decisions to cease further development. The increase in 2011 was attributed to higher upfront, milestone and other licensing payments, unfavorable foreign exchange, and additional development costs resulting from the acquisition of ZymoGenetics. Upfront, milestone and other licensing payments were $207 million in 2011, including an $88 million payment associated with an amendment of an intellectual property license agreement for Yervoy prior to its FDA approval and payments for exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain programs and compounds. Impairment charge for BMS-986094 intangible asset A $1.8 billion impairment charge was recognized when the development of BMS-986094 (formerly INX-189), a compound which we acquired as part of our acquisition of Inhibitex to treat hepatitis C virus infection, was discontinued in the interest of patient safety.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information. 50 Other (income)/expense Other (income)/expense include: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2012 2011 2010 Interest expense $ 182 $ 145 $ 145 Investment income (106 ) (91 ) (75 ) Provision for restructuring 174 116 113 Litigation charges/(recoveries) (45 ) 6 (2 ) Equity in net income of affiliates (183 ) (281 ) (313 ) Impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations 236 Out-licensed intangible asset impairment 38 Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets (53 ) (37 ) (39 ) Other income received from alliance partners, net (312 ) (140 ) (137 ) Pension curtailments and settlements 158 10 28 Other 67 (62 ) (49 ) Other (income)/expense $ (80 ) $ (334 ) $ (93 ) Interest expense increased due to the termination of interest rate swap contracts in 2011 and higher borrowings in 2012. Investment income included a $10 million gain from the sale of auction rate securities in 2012. Provision for restructuring was primarily attributable to employee termination benefits for continuous improvement initiatives. Additional employee termination costs of approximately $300 million are expected to be incurred in 2013 as a result of workforce reductions in several European countries. The majority of the costs will not be recognized until the completion of discussions with local workers council, subject to local regulations. The expected employee reductions are primarily attributed to sales force personnel resulting from restructuring of the Sanofi and Otsuka agreements and streamlining of the operations due to challenging market conditions in Europe. Litigation charges/(recoveries) in 2012 included $172 million for our share of the Apotex damages award concerning Plavix* , partially offset by increases in reserves for product liability, pricing, sales and promotional matters. Equity in net income of affiliates is primarily related to our international partnership with Sanofi which decreased in 2012 as a result of the continued impact of generic competition on international Plavix* net sales, conversion of certain territories to opt-out markets and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations in 2010 was primarily attributed to the disposal of our manufacturing operations in Latina, Italy. Out-licensed intangible asset impairment charges are related to assets acquired in the Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) and ZymoGenetics acquisitions and resulted from unfavorable clinical trial results and/or abandonment of the programs. Similar charges of $15 million were included in research and development in 2011. Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets was primarily related to the sale of a building in Mexico in 2012 and the sale of mature brands in 2011 and 2010. Other income from alliance partners includes income earned from the Sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront, milestone and other licensing payments related to other alliances. The decrease in U.S. Plavix* net sales resulted in lower development royalties owed to Sanofi in 2012. A pension settlement charge was recognized in 2012 for the primary U.S. pension plan as a result of annual lump sum payments exceeding interest and service costs during the fourth quarter. The charge included the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses. Similar charges might occur in the future. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities for further detail. The change in Other is primarily related to higher acquisition costs and losses on debt repurchases in 2012 and sales tax reimbursements, gains on debt repurchases, and higher upfront, milestone and licensing receipts in 2011. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that due to their significant and/or unusual nature are evaluated on an individual basis. Similar charges or gains for some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance which include the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products on a global basis and to enhance an investor overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. 51 Specified items were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2012 2011 2010 Accelerated depreciation, asset impairment and other shutdown costs $ 147 $ 75 $ 113 Amortization of acquired Amylin intangible assets 229 Amortization of Amylin collaboration proceeds (114 ) Amortization of Amylin inventory adjustment 23 Cost of products sold 285 75 113 Stock compensation from accelerated vesting of Amylin awards 67 Process standardization implementation costs 18 29 35 Marketing, selling and administrative 85 29 35 Stock compensation from accelerated vesting of Amylin awards 27 Upfront, milestone and other licensing payments 47 207 132 IPRD impairment 142 28 10 Research and development 216 235 142 Impairment charge for BMS-986094 intangible asset 1,830 Provision for restructuring 174 116 113 Impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations 236 Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets (51 ) (12 ) Pension curtailments and settlements 151 13 18 Acquisition related items 43 10 Litigation charges/(recoveries) (45 ) 9 (2 ) Upfront, milestone and other licensing receipts (10 ) (20 ) Out-licensed intangible asset impairment 38 Loss on debt repurchases 27 Other (income)/expense 327 106 375 Decrease to pretax income 2,743 445 665 Income tax on items above (947 ) (136 ) (180 ) Out-of period tax adjustment (59 ) Specified tax (benefit)/charge* (392 ) (97 ) 207 Income taxes (1,339 ) (233 ) (32 ) Decrease to net earnings $ 1,404 $ 212 $ 633 * The 2012 specified tax benefit relates to a capital loss deduction. The 2011 specified tax benefit relates to releases of tax reserves that were specified in prior periods. The 2010 specified tax charge relates to a tax charge from additional U.S. taxable income from earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. The reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2012 2011 2010 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS GAAP $ 1,960 $ 3,709 $ 3,102 Earnings attributable to unvested restricted shares (1 ) (8 ) (12 ) Net Earnings Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation GAAP $ 1,959 $ 3,701 $ 3,090 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS GAAP $ 1,960 $ 3,709 $ 3,102 Less Specified Items 1,404 212 633 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS Non-GAAP 3,364 3,921 3,735 Earnings attributable to unvested restricted shares (1 ) (8 ) (12 ) Net Earnings Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation Non-GAAP $ 3,363 $ 3,913 $ 3,723 Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted 1,688 1,717 1,727 Diluted EPS Attributable to BMS GAAP $ 1.16 $ 2.16 $ 1.79 Diluted EPS Attributable to Specified Items 0.83 0.12 0.37 Diluted EPS Attributable to BMS Non-GAAP $ 1.99 $ 2.28 $ 2.16 52 Income Taxes The $161 million income tax benefit in 2012 was attributable to a $392 million capital loss deduction resulting from the tax insolvency of Inhibitex. The impact of this deduction reduced the effective tax rate by 16.7 percentage points. In addition to this impact, the effective tax rate in 2012 was substantially lower than 24.7% in 2011 and 25.7% in 2010 resulting primarily from favorable earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions. The change in earnings mix was primarily attributed to lower Plavix* sales and a $1,830 million impairment charge for BMS-986094 intangible asset in the U.S and to a lesser extent, an internal transfer of intellectual property. The transfer of selected intellectual property rights outside the U.S. (for existing and new products) is part of our strategy to place key assets closer to where manufacturing, distribution, and other operational decisions are made. The favorable earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions is expected to continue at least through 2013 (excluding the impact of the impairment charge). Historically, the effective income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to our decision to indefinitely reinvest the earnings for certain of our manufacturing operations in Ireland and Puerto Rico. We have favorable tax rates in Ireland and Puerto Rico under grants not scheduled to expire prior to 2023. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The provisions of the Act included the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and look through exception for 2012 and 2013. As a result, the 2012 R&D tax credit and look through exception benefit will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013. For a more detailed discussion of income taxes and changes in the effective tax rates, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Income Taxes. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to our Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* partnerships with Sanofi for the territory covering the Americas. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations. The decrease in noncontrolling interest in 2012 resulted from the exclusivity loss in the U.S. of Avapro* / Avalide* in March 2012 and Plavix* in May 2012. The increase in noncontrolling interest in 2011 corresponds to increased net sales of Plavix* in the U.S. A summary of noncontrolling interest is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2012 2011 2010 Sanofi partnerships $ 844 $ 2,323 $ 2,074 Other 14 20 20 Noncontrolling interest-pre-tax 858 2,343 2,094 Income taxes (317 ) (792 ) (683 ) Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest-net of taxes $ 541 $ 1,551 $ 1,411 Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Our net cash/(debt) position was as follows: Dollars in Millions 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,656 $ 5,776 Marketable securities current 1,173 2,957 Marketable securities non-current 3,523 2,909 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 6,352 11,642 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (826 ) (115 ) Long-term debt (6,568 ) (5,376 ) Net cash/(debt) position $ (1,042 ) $ 6,151 Working capital $ 1,242 $ 7,538 The current net debt position and reduction in working capital during 2012 resulted primarily from net cash used in connection with the acquisitions of Amylin and Inhibitex. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. were approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Most of the remaining $5.1 billion is held primarily in low-tax jurisdictions and is attributable to earnings that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and additional U.S. income taxes. We started issuing commercial paper to meet near-term domestic liquidity requirements in preparation for the Amylin acquisition during the third quarter of 2012. The average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $224 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.16% during 2012. The maximum month-end amount of commercial paper outstanding was $700 million with no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2012. We will likely continue to issue commercial paper to meet domestic liquidity requirements as needed. 53 Our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors, which may impact our results of operations. Our investment policy places limits on these investments and the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 9. Financial Instruments. We currently have two separate $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders, including a new facility entered into in July 2012. The facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and are extendable on any anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. No borrowings were outstanding under either revolving credit facility at December 31, 2012 or 2011. In connection with the 2012 Amylin acquisition, BMS issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in a registered public offering consisting of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.875% Notes due 2017, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.000% Notes due 2022 and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.250% Notes due 2042. BMS completed its acquisition of Amylin for an aggregate purchase price of $5.3 billion in 2012. BMS also assumed Amylin net debt and a contractual payment obligation to Lilly, together totaling $2.0 billion (substantially all of which was repaid during 2012). The acquisition was financed through the use of existing cash balances, the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt borrowings described above. Additional regulations in the U.S. could be passed in the future which could further reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. We also continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain European countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts, creditworthiness of our customers, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our direct customers. Currently, we believe these economic conditions in the EU will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. As a mechanism to limit our overall credit exposures, and an additional source of liquidity, we sell trade receivables to third parties, principally from wholesalers in Japan and certain government-backed entities in Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Sales of trade receivables in Italy, Portugal and Spain were $322 million in 2012, $484 million in 2011 and $476 million in 2010. Sales of receivables in Japan were $634 million in 2012, $593 million in 2011 and $456 million in 2010. Our sales agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility and we do not retain interest to the underlying assets once sold. We continue to manage our operating cash flows with initiatives designed to improve working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume, such as receivables, inventories, and accounts payable. During 2012, the following changes in receivables, inventories and accounts payable resulted primarily from the rapid reduction of Plavix* sales, the acquisition of Amylin and timing of expenditures in the ordinary course of business. Dollars in Millions December 31, 2012 % of Trailing Twelve Month Net Sales December 31, 2011 % of Trailing Twelve Month Net Sales Net trade receivables $ 1,708 9.7 % $ 2,250 10.6 % Inventories 1,657 9.4 % 1,384 6.5 % Accounts payable (2,202 ) (12.5)% (2,603 ) (12.2)% Total $ 1,163 6.6 % $ 1,031 4.9 % Credit Ratings Moody Investors Service long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains stable. Standard & Poor (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and A-1+, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains stable. S&P upgraded our short-term credit rating from A-1 to A-1+ in May 2012. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A and F1, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains negative. Fitch lowered our long-term credit rating from A+ to A in July 2012. Our credit ratings are considered investment grade. Our long-term ratings designate that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. Our short-term ratings designate that we have the strongest capacity for timely repayment. 54 Cash Flows The following is a discussion of cash flow activities: Dollars in Millions 2012 2011 2010 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 6,941 $ 4,840 $ 4,491 Investing activities (6,727 ) (1,437 ) (3,812 ) Financing activities (4,333 ) (2,657 ) (3,343 ) Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and cash disbursements from all of our activities other than investing activities and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; pension contributions and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. The $2.1 billion increase in operating cash flow in 2012 was primarily attributable to preliminary proceeds of $3.6 billion received from AstraZeneca as consideration for entering into the Amylin collaboration partially offset by lower operating cash flows attributed to Plavix* and Avapro* / Avalide* sales reductions following the exclusivity loss of these products. Investing Activities Cash was used to fund the acquisitions of Amylin ($5.0 billion) and Inhibitex ($2.5 billion) in 2012, Amira ($360 million, including a $50 million contingent payment) in 2011 and ZymoGenetics ($829 million) in 2010. Net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.3 billion in 2012 were primarily attributed to the funding of the Amylin acquisition. Net purchases of marketable securities of $859 million in 2011 and $2.6 billion in 2010 were primarily attributed to the timing of investments in time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities greater than 90 days. Other investing activities included litigation recoveries of $102 million in 2011. Financing Activities Dividend payments were $2.3 billion in 2012, $2.3 billion in 2011 and $2.2 billion in 2010. Dividends declared per common share were $1.37 in 2012, $1.33 in 2011 and $1.29 in 2010. In December 2012, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per common share and expect to pay a dividend for the full year of 2013 of $1.40 per share. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors. Proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and repayments of debt assumed in the Amylin acquisition were $2.0 billion each in 2012. Management periodically evaluates potential opportunities to repurchase certain debt securities and terminate certain interest rate swap contracts prior to their maturity. Cash outflows related to the repurchase of debt were $109 million in 2012, $78 million in 2011 and $855 million in 2010. Proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap contracts were $2 million in 2012, $296 million in 2011 and $146 million in 2010. The Board of Directors increased its authorization for the repurchase of common stock by $3.0 billion in June 2012. The common stock repurchase capacity remaining was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2012. Cash used to repurchase common stock was $2.4 billion in 2012, $1.2 billion in 2011 and $576 million in 2010. Proceeds from stock option exercises were $463 million (including $71 million of cash retained from excess tax benefits) in 2012, $601 million (including $47 million of cash retained from excess tax benefits) in 2011 and $252 million in 2010. The amount of proceeds vary each period based upon fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of the stock options and other factors. 55 Contractual Obligations Payments due by period for our contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 were as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Dollars in Millions Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 162 $ 162 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt 6,631 648 27 659 750 4,547 Interest on long-term debt (a) 4,814 217 237 237 240 215 3,668 Operating leases 756 167 152 130 123 76 108 Purchase obligations 2,089 874 506 336 198 128 47 Uncertain tax positions (b) 83 83 Other long-term liabilities 475 101 58 41 44 231 Total (c) $ 15,010 $ 2,151 $ 1,023 $ 761 $ 1,261 $ 1,213 $ 8,601 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on our short-term and long-term debt securities. Also includes accrued interest payable recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, which consists primarily of accrued interest on short-term and long-term debt as well as accrued periodic cash settlements of derivatives. (b) Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, only the short-term uncertain tax benefits have been provided in the table above. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Income Taxes for further detail. (c) The table above excludes future contributions by us to our pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. Required contributions are contingent upon numerous factors including minimum regulatory funding requirements and the funded status of each plan. Due to the uncertainty of such future obligations, they are excluded from the table. Contributions for both U.S. and international plans are expected to be $100 million in 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities for further detail. In addition to the above, we are committed to $6.0 billion (in the aggregate) of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Early stage milestones, defined as milestones achieved through Phase III clinical trials, comprised $1.1 billion of the total committed amount. Late stage milestones, defined as milestones achieved post Phase III clinical trials, comprised $4.9 billion of the total committed amount. Payments under these agreements generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones, for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. In addition to certain royalty obligations that are calculated as a percentage of net sales, some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating $2.1 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels. We also have certain manufacturing, development, and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations for further information regarding our alliances. For a discussion of contractual obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities, Note 9. Financial Instruments and Note 20. Leases. SEC Consent Order As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. We have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. 56 We maintain inventory management agreements (IMAs) with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. sales. Under the current terms of the IMAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 90% of our gross U.S. sales. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent. Recently Issued Accounting Standards None applicable. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates. These accounting policies were discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and title and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred, which is generally at time of shipment. Revenue is also reduced for gross-to-net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revised information or actual experience. In addition, See Net Sales above for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments. Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments The following categories of gross-to-net sales adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. See Net Sales above for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments. Charge-backs related to government programs Our U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of un-processed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag). Cash discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, cash discounts are offered as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of un-processed cash discounts (typically within a 1 month time lag). 57 Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts Rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit in addition to their commercial plans, as well as other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations globally. Beginning in 2011, the rebates for the Medicare Part D program included a 50% discount on the Company brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Rebates are also required under the U.S. Department of Defense TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program. The estimated amount for these unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts are presented as a liability. A $67 million reversal for the estimated amount of 2011 Medicare Part D coverage gap discounts occurred in 2012 after receipt of the actual invoices. Medicaid rebates Our U.S. businesses participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Retroactive to January 1, 2010, minimum rebates on Medicaid drug sales increased from 15.1% to 23.1%. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans beginning in March 2010. The estimated amount for these unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability. A $37 million reversal for the estimated amount of 2010 and 2011 Managed Medicaid discounts occurred in 2012 after receipt of the actual invoices. Sales returns Products are typically eligible to be returned between six months prior to and twelve months after product expiration, in accordance with our policy. Estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and instances of expected precipitous declines in demand following the loss of exclusivity. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability. Reserves of $173 million were established for Plavix * and Avapro* / Avalide* at December 31, 2012 after considering the relevant factors as well as estimated future retail and wholesale inventory work down that would occur after the loss of exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line or similar therapeutic category. We defer recognition of revenue until the right of return expires or until sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns is developed in limited circumstances. This typically occurs when the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or when historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category is lacking. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand are also considered in estimating sales returns for new products. Although not reflected as a gross to net adjustment, $27 million of revenue related to Yervoy was deferred in 2011 as a result of limited returns experience. Use of information from external sources Information from external sources is used to estimate gross-to-net sales adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information. Retirement Benefits Accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans requires actuarial valuations based on significant assumptions for discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, these significant assumptions and others such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, healthcare trends and mortality rates are evaluated and selected based on expectations or actual experience during each remeasurement date. Pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. 58 The yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate. The Citigroup Pension Discount curve is used for the U.S. plans. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2012 was determined using a 4.25% weighted-average discount rate. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2012 for the U.S. pension plans was determined using a 3.74% discount rate. If the discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2012 was reduced by an additional 1%, such expense would increase by approximately $12 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. pension plans projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2012 was reduced by an additional 1%, the projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $1.2 billion. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated considering expected returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2012 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2012 was reduced by 1%, such expense would increase by $47 million.

Business Combinations Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions were $16.4 billion at December 31, 2012, representing 46% of total assets. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. The fair value of intangible assets, including IPRD, is typically determined using the income method. This method starts with a forecast of net cash flows, risk adjusted for estimated probabilities of technical and regulatory success (for IPRD) and adjusted to present value using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk associated with the cash flow streams. All assets are valued from a market participant view which might be different than specific BMS views. The valuation process is very complex and requires significant input and judgment using internal and external sources. Although the valuations are required to be finalized within a one-year period, it must consider all and only those facts and evidence available at the acquisition date. The most complex and judgmental matters applicable to the valuation process are summarized below: Unit of account Most intangible assets are valued as single global assets rather than multiple assets for each jurisdiction or indication after considering the development stage, expected levels of incremental costs to obtain additional approvals, risks associated with further development, amount and timing of benefits expected to be derived in the future, expected patent lives in various jurisdictions and the intention to promote the asset as a global brand. Estimated useful life The asset life expected to contribute meaningful cash flows is determined after considering all pertinent matters associated with the asset, including expected regulatory approval dates (if unapproved), exclusivity periods and other legal, regulatory or contractual provisions as well as the effects of any obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors, including barriers to entry. Probability of Technical and Regulatory Success (PTRS) Rate PTRS rates are determined based upon industry averages considering the respective programs development stage and disease indication and adjusted for specific information or data known at the acquisition date. Subsequent clinical results or other internal or external data obtained could alter the PTRS rate and materially impact the estimated fair value of the intangible asset in subsequent periods leading to impairment charges. Projections Future revenues are estimated after considering many factors such as initial market opportunity, pricing, sales trajectories to peak sales levels, competitive environment and product evolution. Future costs and expenses are estimated after considering historical market trends, market participant synergies and the timing and level of additional development costs to obtain the initial or additional regulatory approvals, maintain or further enhance the product. We generally assume initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals which typically may not occur for a number of years. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than those assumed since projections are subjected to multiple factors including trial results and regulatory matters which could materially change the ultimate commercial success of the asset as well as significantly alter the costs to develop the respective asset into commercially viable products. Tax rates The expected future income is tax effected using a market participant tax rate. Our recent valuations typically use a U.S. tax rate (and applicable state taxes) after considering the jurisdiction in which the intellectual property is held and location of research and manufacturing infrastructure. We also considered that any earnings repatriation would likely have U.S. tax consequences. Discount rate Discount rates are selected after considering the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the asset life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset. 59 See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions for specific details and values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions of Amylin and Inhibitex in 2012, Amira in 2011 and ZymoGenetics in 2010. Significant estimates utilized at the time of the valuations to support the fair values of the lead compounds within the acquisitions include: Estimated Phase of Year of first Discount useful life Development as PTRS Rate projected positive Dollars in Millions Fair value rate utilized (in years) of acquisition date utilized cash flow Commercialized products: Bydureon* $ 5,260 11.1% 13 N/A N/A N/A Byetta* 770 10.0% 7 N/A N/A N/A Symlin* 310 10.0% 9 N/A N/A N/A Recothrom 230 11.0% 10 N/A N/A N/A IPRD: BMS-986094 (formerly INX-189) 1,830 12.0% N/A Phase II 38.0% 2017 Metreleptin 120 12.0% N/A Phase III 75.0% 2017 AM152 160 12.5% N/A Phase I 12.5% 2021 Peginterferon lambda 310 13.5% N/A Phase IIB 47.6% 2014 Impairment Goodwill Goodwill was $7.6 billion at December 31, 2012. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment on an enterprise level by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. Examples of qualitative factors assessed in the current year included our share price, our financial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test performed in the prior year. Positive and negative influences of each relevant factor were assessed both individually and in the aggregate and as a result it was concluded that no additional quantitative testing was required. For discussion on goodwill, acquired in-process research and development and other intangible assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Goodwill, Acquired In-Process Research and Development and Other Intangible Assets. Other Intangible Assets, including IPRD Other intangible assets were $8.8 billion at December 31, 2012, including licenses ($626 million), developed technology rights ($7.2 billion), capitalized software ($261 million) and IPRD ($668 million). Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances warrant a review, although IPRD is required to be tested at least annually. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. Considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPRD impairment charges are likely to occur in future periods. We recognized charges of $2.1 billion in 2012 including a $1.8 billion charge resulting from the discontinued development of BMS-986094 and for other projects previously acquired in the Medarex, Inc and Inhibitex acquisition resulting from unfavorable clinical trial results, additional development costs, extended development periods and decisions to cease further development. We also recognized charges of $30 million in 2011 and $10 million in 2010 related to three Medarex projects for which development has ceased. IPRD is closely monitored and assessed each period for impairment. In addition to IPRD, commercial assets are also subject to impairment. For example, an impairment charge of $120 million was recognized in 2012 related to a non-key product ( Recothrom ) acquired in the acquisition of ZymoGenetics after continuing competitive pricing pressures. The preliminary estimated fair value of developed technology rights resulting from the acquisition of Amylin was $6.3 billion, including $5.3 billion allocated to a recently-launched single asset, Bydureon* . These assets are monitored for changes in expectations from those used in the initial valuation, including revenue trends and operating synergies. 60 Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Contingencies, Note 7. Income Taxes and Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $5.1 billion, net of valuation allowances of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and $3.2 billion, net of valuation allowances of $3.9 billion at December 31, 2011. Deferred tax assets related to a U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforward of $170 million and a U.S. Federal tax credit carryforward of $31 million were recognized at December 31, 2012. The net operating loss carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The U.S. Federal tax credit carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2017. The realization of these carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. In addition, a deferred tax asset related to a U.S. Federal and state capital loss of $794 million was recognized at December 31, 2012 that can be carried back three years and carried forward five years. The realization of this carryforward is dependent upon generating sufficient capital gains prior to its expiration. A $411 million valuation allowance was established for this item at December 31, 2012. Taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be reinvested indefinitely offshore. During 2010, the Company completed an internal reorganization of certain legal entities which contributed to a $207 million tax charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is possible that U.S. tax authorities could assert additional material tax liabilities arising from the reorganization. If such assertion were to occur, the Company would vigorously challenge any such assertion and believes it would prevail; however there can be no assurance of such a result. Prior to the Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (Mead Johnson) split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and; (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions. Certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value. In addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (ELA) existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009. We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement. For example, Mead Johnson has agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson stock or assets. We have agreed to indemnify Mead Johnson for certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the IPO and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. 61 We established liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 62
