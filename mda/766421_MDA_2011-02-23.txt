ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in t his report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2010 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of the results of operations of Alaska and Horizon for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. We believe this analysis will help the read er better understand our consolidated statements of operations. Financial and statistical data for Alaska and Horizon are also included here. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2011 . Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. Prospective Accounting Pronouncements a discussion of recently issued and proposed accounting pronouncements. Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, an overview of financial position and the impact of inflation and changing prices. YEAR IN REVIEW Our 2010 consolidated pretax income was $405.9 million compared to $202.9 million in 2009 . The $203.0 million improvement in our pretax earnings was primarily due to the $432.5 million increase in operating revenues, partially offset by a $242.8 million increase in aircraft fuel expense. The increase in operating revenues was driven by a 9.8% increase in passenger traffic on relatively flat yield for the year. Fuel cost increased over the prior year primarily due to to a 27% increase in our raw fuel cost per gallon on relatively flat consumption for the year. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses for both Alaska and Horizon. Accomplishments and Highlights Accomplishments and highlights from 2010 include: We reported record earnings for 2010. Both companies continued their excellent operational performance again in 2010 as measured by on-time arrivals and completion rate as reported t o the Department of Transportation (DOT). At Alaska, we led the ten largest carriers in on-time performance for the year. For the third year in a row, Alaska Airlines ranked Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers in 2010 by J.D. Power and Associates. Alaska was also named "Top Performing Airline" by Aviation Week magazine, and recognized for having the "Best Loyalty C redit Card" in North America in 2010 at the Frequent Travel Awards. Alaska Airlines announced an agreement to purchase 15 new Boeing 737 aircraft, including 13 B737-900ER aircraft, for deliver in 2012 through 2014. In addition, Horizon Air announced its final transition to all-Q400 fleet in 2011. 25 Table of Contents During the year, we reached agreements with several of our labor groups that provide for improved productivity and a common gain-sharing formula. See Update on Labor Negotiations below for further discussion. For the year, our employees earn ed $92.0 million in incentive pay for meeting certain operational and financial goals. We also contributed $145.6 million to Alaska defined benefit pension plans. Aircraft Purchase Commitments In January 2011, we entered into an aircraft purchase agreement with Boeing to purchase 15 new B737 ai rcraft, including two B737-800 aircraft and 13 B737-900ER aircraft, with deliveries beginning in late 2012 and continuing through 2014. The agreement also includes options to purchase 15 additional B737-900ER aircraft with delivery positions in 2016 and 2017. Based on the current list prices, the total value of this contract is approximately $1.3 billion. Update on Labor Negotiations Both Alaska and Horizon have had success recently with amended bargaining agreements or con tract extensions with a number of labor unions. All of the new agreements or extensions ratified in 2010 include participation by the represented employees in Air Group Performance-Based Pay (PBP) incentive plan as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. PBP is described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. With these recent contracts, virtually all of our employees now participate in PBP. Alaska Labor Contracts Alaska reached a tentative agreement in December 2010 on a three-year contract with its largest represented group the clerical, offic e and passenger service employees. This agreement was ratified in the first quarter of 2011 and included participation in the PBP incentive plan, a $1,500 signing bonus per employee and annual wage increases. Horizon Labor Contracts In the fourth quarter of 2010, Horizon reached labor agreements with its pilots and mechanics. Both agreements include participation in the PBP plan for represented employees. The pilot agreement includes a contract signing bonus and a provision for wage arbitration on the first and third anniversary date of the contract. Horizon Restructuring and Fleet Transition In 2010, we made several structural changes to the Horizon business as follows: We outsourced the remaining heavy maintenance functions for Horizon aircraft in the third quarter of 2010. We believe this change will result in approximately $3 million in cost savings annually. This resulted in the reduction of approximately 100 mechanics and other personnel through voluntary furlough or early retirement. We recorded a $2.9 million charge associated with related separation pay, all of which was paid during the third quarter of 2010. We are completing our transition to an all-Q400 fleet. In 2010, Horizon transferred five CRJ-700 aircraft to third parties through either sublease or lease assignment. We recorded a charge of $10.3 million associated with these transactions. We have 13 CRJ-700 aircraft remaining in our operating fleet as of December 31, 2010. We have signed a letter of intent to dispose of eight of the remaining CRJ-700 aircraft in 2011 through either sublease or lease assignment to a third-party carrier. The remaining five aircraft will be flown by SkyWest Airlines on behalf of Alaska Airlines pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement. We expect charges of up to $3 million at the cease-use date per aircraft for each of those 13 aircraft. 26 Table of Contents New Markets In 2010, Alaska added several new cities and non-stop routes to our overall network as follows: New Non-Stop Routes Between Frequency (Weekly) Start Date San Jose and Maui 3 x week ly 3/11/2010 San Jose and Kona 4 x weekly 3/12/2010 Sacramento and Maui Daily 3/26/2010 Portland and Honolulu Daily 9/20/2010 San Diego and Maui Daily 10/1/2010 San Diego and Puerto Vallarta Daily (seasonal) 11/12/2010 Portland and Kona 4 x weekly (seasonal) 11/12/2010 San Jose and Los Cabos 2 x weekly 12/4/2010 Seattle and St. Louis Daily 9/27/2010 San Jose and Guadalajara 4 x weekly 12/15/2010 Sacramento and Guadalajara 3 x weekly 12/16/2010 In addition to these markets, Alaska began daily service between Bellingham and Honolulu in January 7, 2011 and will begin daily service between San Jose and Kauai and between Oakland and Kauai in March 2011. Horizon also expanded service to include new non-stop routes between Bellingham and Portland six times weekly beginning on June 18, 2010 and non-stop routes between between Los Angeles and Sa n Jose three times weekly beginning on August 23, 2010. The changes above, when combined with the significant number of network changes over the last few years, have diversified our network and made us less dependent on our historical markets in the State of Alaska and up and down the West Coast. We believe our smaller size makes us more nimble than some of our larger competitors, gives us a closer connection with our customers and allows us to identify and respond to market opportunities quickly. Stock Repurchase In June 2009, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock. Under this program, we repurchased 1,970,326 shares of our common stock. This program expired in June 2010. In June 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock. Through December 31, 2010, we repurchased 355,000 shares of common stock for approximately $18.8 million under this program. This program will expire in June 2011. Outlook Our primary focus every year is to run safe, compliant and reliable operations at our airlines. In addition to our primary objective, our key initiative in 2011 is to maintain our focus on optimizing revenue. Our specific focus will be on the way we merchandise fares and ancillary products and services on our website and through mobile applications. Our biggest concern for 2011 is the rising cost of fuel. However, with our fuel-efficient aircraft and our fuel hedge portfolio, we believe we are better prepared to handle those rising costs than others in the industry. For the first quarter of 2011, our advance booked load factors are up slightly compared to 2010 on significant increases in capacity. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 Our consolidated net income for 2010 was a record $251.1 million , or $6.83 per diluted share, compared to net income of 27 Table of Contents $121.6 million , or $3.36 per share, in 2009 . Items that impact the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect timing of gain and loss recognition resulting from mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting. For 2010 , we recognized net mark-to-market losses of $ 5.3 million ($ 3.3 million after tax, or $ 0.09 per share), compared to net gains of $88.8 million ($55.2 million after tax, or $1.53 per share) in 2009 . 2010 included Horizon restructuring and fleet transition costs of $13.2 million ($8.2 million after tax, or $ 0.22 per share). 2 009 included the new Alaska pilot contract transition costs of $35.8 million ($22.3 million after tax, or $0.62 per share). ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because: It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases; We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts; Our results excluding these items are most often used in internal management and board reporting and decision-making; Our results excluding these adjustments serve as the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus the information allows investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; and It is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to those of other airlines. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. Excluding the items noted above, and as shown in the following table, our consolidated net income for 2010 was a record $262.6 million, or $7.14 per diluted share, compared to $88.7 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, in 2009 .

Alaska and Horizon reported pretax income of $401.6 million and $7.6 million , respectively, in 2010 . Financial and statistical data and an in-depth discussion of the results of Alaska and Horizon are on the following pages.

ALASKA REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $420.6 million, or 14.0% , during 2010 compared to 2009t> . The changes are summarized in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 %Change Passenger revenue mainline $ 2,763.4 $ 2,438.8 13.3 Freight and mail 101.9 91.5 11.4 Other net 228.8 187.3 22.2 Total mainline operating revenues $ 3,094.1 $ 2,717.6 13.9 Passenger revenue purchased capacity 332.5 288.4 15.3 Total operating revenues $ 3,426.6 $ 3,006.0 14.0 Operating Revenues Mainline &nbsp ; Mainline passenger revenue for 2010 improved by 13.3% on a 5.6% increase in capacity and a 7.3% increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) compared to 2009. The increase in PRASM was driven by a 2.3% rise in ticket yield and a 4.0 -point increase in load factor compared to prior year due to an increase in passengers. Ancillary revenue included in passenger revenue increased from $131.8 million in 2009 to $179.7 million in 2010. The increase is primarily due to the implementation of our first checked bag fee in the third quarter of 2009 and growth in the number of passengers. Freight and mail revenue increased $10.4 million, or 11.4% , primarily as a result of higher volumes and yield and higher security and freight fuel surcharges. Other net revenue increased $41.5 million, or 22.2% , from 2009 . The increase is primarily due to Mileage Plan revenues rising by $31.8 million stemming from a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles. Passenger Revenue Purchased Capacity Passenger revenue purchased capacity flying increased by $44.1 million or 15.3% compared to 2009 due to a 5.2% rise in capacity combined with a 9.6% increase in unit revenue. Unit revenue increased as a result of a 2.9 -point improvement in load factor and a 5.4% increase in ticket yield. div> ALASKA EXPENSES For 2010 , total operating expenses increased $199.2 million, or 7.2 %, compared to 2009 mostly as a result of higher aircraft 30 Table of Contents fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Years Ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 %Change td> Mainline fuel expense $ 760.6 d> $ 549.0 38.5 Mainline non-fuel expenses 1,916.9 1,946.7 (1.5 ) Mainline operating expenses $ 2,677.5 $ 2,495.7 7.3 Purchased capacity costs 298.9 281.5 6.2 Total Operating Expenses $ 2,976.4 $ 2,777.2 7.2 Mainline Operating Expenses Total mainline operating expenses increased $181.8 million, or 7.3% , during 2010 compared to the prior year. The increase was mostly due to the $211.6 million increase in aircraft fuel expense, partially offset by charges for the pilot contract recorded in 2009. Significant operating expense variances from 2009 are more fully described below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits decreased by $25.4 million, or 3.2% , compared to 2009 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions) 2010 2009 %Change Wages $ 544.2 $ 540.4 0.7 Pension and defined-contribution retirement benefits 84.2 114.8 (26.7 ) Medical benefits 87.9 83.3 5.5 Other benefits and payroll taxes 50.9 54.1 (5.9 ) Total wages and benefits $ 767.2 $ 792.6 (3.2 ) Wages were relatively flat on a reduction in full time equivalent employees (FTE) compared to 2009 . Wages have not declined in step with the FTE reduction because of higher wage rates for the pilot group in connection with their new contract effective April 1, 2009 and higher average wages for certain other employees after 2009 and early 2010 furloughs, which are generally seniority-based. However, productivity as measured by the number of passengers per FTE increased 9.4% compared to 2009. The 26.7% decline in pension and other retirement-related benefits is primarily due to a significant reduction in our defined-benefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2009 as compared to the previous year and the closing of the defined-benefit pension plans to new pilot entrants with their new contract in 2009. Medical benefits increased 5.5% from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in employee healthcare costs partially offset by a decrease in post-retirement medical expense for the pilot group iv> We expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2011 as compared to 2010 because of an increase in the number of FTEs as we bring back furloughed employees to handle the expected growth in 2011. In addition, we expect increases related to annual wages and the cost of healthcare. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $61.6 million in 2009 to $75.0 million in 2010 . The increase is partially due to the fact that in 2010, our financial and operational results exceeded targets established by our Board more so than in 2009. In 2010, additional workgroups were included to the PBP plan, resulting in higher earnings than the profi t sharing plan in which they previously participated. Over the long term, our plan is designed to pay at target, although we may meet, not meet, or exceed those targets in any single year. At target, we estimate the PBP expense would be $39 million and aggregate incentive pay for all plans, including OPR, would be approximately $51 million for 2011 , which would be lower than in 2010 . 31 Table of Contents Aircraft Fuel &n bsp; Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices a re impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. Aircraft fuel expense increased $211.6 million, or 38.5% , compared to 2009 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2010 2009 %Change Fuel gallons consumed 319.6 304.9 4.8ont> Raw price per gallon $ 2.38 $ 1.88 26.6 Total raw fuel expense $ 760.1 $ 572.3 32.8 Net impact on fuel expense from (gains) and los ses arising from fuel-hedging activities 0.5 (23.3 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 760.6 $ 549.0 38.5 NM = Not Meaningful Fuel gallons consumed increased 4.8% , primarily as a result of a 2.4% increase in block hours, partially offset by better fuel efficiency stemming from longer average stage lengths. The raw fuel price per gallon rose 26.6% as a result of higher West Coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs and refining margins. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, offset by the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense a nd economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2010 2009 %Change Raw fuel expense $ 760.1 $ 572.3 32.8 Plus or minus: net of cash received from settled hedges and premium expense recognized (2.8 ) 50.4 NM Economic fuel expense $ 757.3 $ 622.7 21.6 Fuel gallons consumed 319.6 304.9 4.8 Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.37 $ 2.05 15.6 NM = Not Meaningful As noted above, the total net benefit recognized for hedges that settled during the period was $2.8 million in 2010 , compared to a net expense of $50.4 million in 2009 . These amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement. We currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.80 in the first quarter of 2011 due to the rising cost of crude oil. As oil prices are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full year cost with any certainty. 32 Table of Contents Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance declined by $10.8 million, or 6.4% , compared to the prior year primarily because of less expensive events, lower component costs, and decreased costs associated with aircraft returns. We expect aircraft maintenance to remain relatively flat in 2011 . Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent declined $11.9 million , or 10.9% , compared to 2009 as a result of the return of five leased aircraft in 2010. We expect aircraft rent to be lower in 2011 as we annualize lease returns from 2010. We currently do not expect any leased aircraft to be returned in 2011, nor do we expect to lease any new aircraft. Landing Fees and Other Rents Landing fees and other rents increased $6.5 million , or 3.9% , compared to 2009 . The increase is attributable to higher rates in many airports across our network and more departures. We expect landing fees to be higher in 2011 due to increased departure volume. Selling Expenses &nbsp ; Selling expenses increased by $19.8 million, or 18.9% , compared to 2009 as a result of higher credit card and travel agency commissions and ticket distribution costs resulting from the increase in passenger revenue. We expect selling expenses will be higher in 2011 as compared to 2010 , primarily due to higher revenue-related expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $10.0 million, or 5.6% , compared to 2009 . This is primarily due to the four B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2010 and a full period of depreciation for aircraft delivered in 2009 . We expect depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2011 due to the full-year impact of aircraft that were delivered in 2010 and for expected 2011 aircraft deliveries. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage costs increased $7.5 million , or 15.7% , from 2009 due to an increased number of passengers, the higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board, and increased costs associated with food delivery. We expect food and beverage costs to increase in 2011 due to increased passenger and departure volume. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses declined $5.3 million, or 3.4% , compared to the prior year. The decline is primarily driven by a reduction in outside professional services costs and lower personnel non-wage costs, partially offset by higher property taxes. We expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2011. New Pilot Contract Transition Costs During 2009, in connection with a new four-year contract, Alaska's pilots received a one-time aggregate bonus of $20.3 million. We also recorded transition expense associated with establishing the new sick-leave payout program which totaled $15.5 million, bringing the total pilot contract transition cost to $35.8 million. 33 Table of Contents Mainline Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 % Change Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 10.96 10.78 1.7 Less the following components: Aircraft fuel costs per ASM 3.11 2.37 31.2 New pilot contract transition costs per AS M 0.15 NM CASM, excluding fuel and noted items 7.85 8.26 (5.0 ) NM = Not Meaningful We have listed separately in the above table our fuel costs per ASM and our unit costs, excluding fuel and other noted items. These amounts are included in CASM, but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our cost-reduction progress. We believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons: font> By eliminating fuel expense and certain special items from our unit cost metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by our management and by our Board of Directors in assessing quarter ly and annual cost performance. For Alaska, these decision-makers evaluate operating results of the mainline operation, which includes the operation of the B737 fleet branded in Alaska Airlines livery. The revenue and expenses associated with purchased capacity are evaluated separately. Cost per ASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our incen tive pay plan documents) is an important metric for the PBP incentive plan that covers our employees. Cost per ASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors.t> Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items such as fleet transition costs, new pilot contract transition costs, and restructuring charges is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily ind icative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our mainline passenger unit revenue for Alaska, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate mainline unit revenue excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total mainline operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenue in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. We currently forecast our mainline costs per ASM excluding fuel and other special items for the first quarter and full year of 2011 to be down 5% to 6% and 3% respectively, compared to 2010 . The expected decline in unit cost stems from expected capacity growth of 13% in the first quarter and 8% to 9% for the full year, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating costs as described in the preceding pages. Historical cost per ASM excluding fuel and other special items can be found in Item 6, 34 Table of Contents Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Data. Purchased Capacity Costs Purchased capacity costs increased $17.4 million compared to 2009 . Of the total, $ 274.4 million was paid to Horizon under the Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) for 1.4 billion ASMs. This expense is eliminated in consolidation. For 2011, the amount recorded as purchased capacity cost will increase significantly as Horizon discontinued its "brand flying" effective January 1, 2011 and moved to an all-CPA model. 35 Table of Contents HORIZON AIR FINANCIAL AND STATISTICAL DATA nt> Three Months Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31 Financial Data (in millions) : 2010 2009 % Change 2010 2009 % Change 2008 % Change Operating Revenues: &nbsp ; iv> Passe nger - brand flying $ 95.1 $ 98.2 (3.2 ) $ 394.5 $ 381.9 3.3 $ 429.2 (11.0 ) Passenger - capacity purchase arrangements (a) 71.6 70.5 1.6 274.4 261.7 4.9 293.7 (10.9 ) Total passenger revenue 166.7 168.7 (1.2 ) 668.9 643.6 3.9 v> 722.9 (11.0 ) Freight and mail 0.6 0.7 (14.3 ) 2.5 2.7 &nbsp ; (7.4 ) 2.7 Other - net 2.3 2.1 9.5 8.6 8.1 6.2 8.3 (2.4 ) Total Operating Revenues 169.6 171.5 (1.1 ) 680.0 654.4 3.9 733.9 (10.8 ) Operating Expenses: Wages and benefits 47.8 48.2 (0.8 ) 183.0 185.2 (1.2 ) 194.1 (4.6 ) Variable incentive pay 6.5 6.2 &nbsp ; 4.8 17.0 14.4 18.1 5.6 157.1 Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 31.4 29.4 6.8 140.3 109.1 28.6 236.0 (53.8 ) Aircraft maintenance 15.5 13.6 14.0 57.4 53.2 7.9 58.2 (8.6 ) Aircraft rent 9.7 11.1 (12.6 ) 41.8 44.7 (6.5 ) 56.9 (21.4 ) Landing fees and other rentals 15.9 15.3 3.9 60.7 57.7 5.2 57.2 0.9 Contracted services 8.3 8.3 33.3 32.1 3.7 29.1 10.3 Selling expenses 6.9 6.6 4.5 29.3 27.1 8.1 &nb sp; 31.1 (12.9 ) Depreciation and amortization 10.4 ont> 10.7 (2.8 ) 41.0 &nb sp; 39.5 3.8 37.5 5.3 Food and beverage service 0.6 0.6 2.3 2.4 (4.2 ) 2.6 (7.7 ) Other 10.0 10.4 (3.8 ) 36.3 39.4 (7.9 ) 42.7 (7.7 ) Fleet transition costs - CRJ-700 NM 13.2 div> NM 13.5 NM Fleet transition costs - Q200 NM 8.8 NM 10.2 NM Total Operating Expenses 163.0 160.4 1.6 655.6 613.6 6.8 774.7 (20.8 ) font> Operating Income (Loss) 6.6 11.1 &nb sp; NM 24.4 40.8 NM (40.8 ) NM Interest income 1.0 0.5 3.6 2.0 5.4 Interest expense (4.7 ) (3.8 ) (20.5 ) (20.1 ) (23.8 ) Interest capitalized 0.5 ont> 0.5 0.3 3.0 Other - net (0.1 ) & nbsp; (0.1 ) (0.4 ) (0.2 ) 0.4 (3.3 ) (3.4 ) (16.8 ) (18.0 ) (15.0 ) Income (Loss) Before Income Tax $ 3.3 $ 7.7 NM $ 7.6 div> $ 22.8 NM $ (55.8 ) NM Combined Operating Statistics: Revenue passengers (000) 1,704 1,704 6,820 6,759 0.9 7,390 (8.5 ) RPMs (000,000) "traffic" 593 609 (2.6 ) 2,450 2,408 1.7 2,635 (8.6 ) ASMs (000,000) "capacity" 774 822 (5.8 ) 3,235 3,292 (1.7 ) 3,617 (9.0 ) Passenger load factor 76.6 % 74.1 % 2.5 pts 75.7 % 73.1 % 2.6 pts 72.9 % 0.2 pts Yield per passenger mile 28.11 27.70 1.5 27.30 26.73 2.1 27.43 (2.6 ) RASM 21.91 20.86 5.0 21.02 19.88 5.7 20.29 (2.0 ) PRASM 21.54 20.52 5.0 20.68 &nbs p; 19.55 5.8ont> 19.99 (2.2 ) Operating expenses per ASM 21.06 19.51 7.9 20.27 18.64 8.7 21.42 (13.0 ) Aircraft fuel cost per ASM 4.06 3.57 13.7 4.34 3.31 31.1 6.53 (49.3 ) CRJ-700 fleet transition costs per ASM NM td> 0.41 NM 0.37 NM Operating expenses per ASM, excluding fuel and CRJ-700 fleet transition costs 1 7.00 15.94 6.6 15.52 15.33 1.2 d> 14.52 5.5 Q200 fleet transition costs per ASM NM 0.27 NM 0.28 NM Aircraft fuel cost per gallon $ 2.25 $ 1.96 14.8 $ 2.43 $ 1.82 33.5 &nbsp ; $ 3.53 (48.4 ) Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.57 $ div> 2.32 10.8 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 15.9 $ 3.05 (32.1 ) Fuel gallons (000,000) 14.0 15.0 (6.7 ) 57.7 60.1 (4.0 ) 66.9 (10.2 ) Average number of full-time equivalent employees 2,938 3,275 (10.3 ) 3,045 3,308 (8.0 ) 3,699 (10.6 ) Aircraft utilization (blk hrs/day) 8.1 8.1 8.0 8.3 (3.6 ) 8.3 Average aircraft stage l ength (miles) 331 330 0.3 333 327 &nb sp; 1.8 322 1.6 Operating fleet at period-end 54 58 (4 ) a/c 54 58 (4 ) a/c 59 (1 ) a/c NM = Not Meaningful 36 Table of Contents HORIZON AIRt> Horizon reported pretax income of $7.6 million in 2010 compared to pretax income of $22.8 million in 2009 .

HORIZON EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $ 42.0 million, or 6.8% , as compared to 2009 . Significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows. 37 Table of Contents Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel increased $ 31.2 million, or 28.6% , compared to the same period in 2009 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2010 2009 %Change Fuel gallons consumed 57.7 60.1 & nbsp; (4.0 ) Raw price per gallon iv> $ 2.41 $ 1.90 26.8 Total raw fuel expense $ 138.8 $ 113.9 21.9 Net impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities 1.5 (4.8 ) NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 140.3 $ 109.1 28.6 NM = Not Meaningful Fuel gallons consumed declined by 4% due to a 1.7% decline in capacity and improved fuel burn as we continue our transition to the more fuel-efficient Q400 aircraft.

These amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement. Restructuring and Fleet Transition Costs W e recorded $10.3 million in 2010 related to the removal of five CRJ-700 aircraft from our operations under sublease or lease assignment to third-party carriers. We also recorded $2.9 million of restructuring charges associated with the voluntary separation of a number of employees resulting from the decision to outsource the remaining aircraft heavy maintenance function to a third party. In 2009, fleet transition costs associated with the removal of Q200 aircraft from the operating fleet were $8.8 million as the final Q200 aircraft were removed from operation. All Other Operating Expenses All other operating expenses increased by $6.4 million due primarily to a $4.2 million increase in aircraft maintenance expense driven by higher engine events and a $3.0 million increase in landing fees and rents from higher rates in many airports. These increases were partially offset by a $2.9 million decline in aircraft rent due to the removal of five leased CRJ-700 aircraft during the year, and a $3.1 million decline in other operating expenses. 38 Table of Contents Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 %Change Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 20.27 18.64 8.7 d> CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 4.34 3.31 31.1 CRJ-700 fleet tra nsition costs per ASM 0.41 NM CASM, excluding fuel and noted items 15.52 15.33 1.2 Q200 fleet transition costs per ASM 0.27 NM NM = Not Meaningful CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $65.7 million in 2010 compared to $64.5 million in 2009 . Interest expense increased $4.0 million primarily due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties on debt prepaid in 2010, partially offset by lower average interest rates on our variable-rate debt and a lower average debt balance. Other net nonoperating income (expense) improved by $6.6 million compared to 2009 primarily due to larger realized gains on the sale of marketable securities. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income for 2010 was 38.1%, compared to 40.1% for 2009 . The difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 37.9% is due to nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. Our effective tax rate can vary significantly between quarters and for the full year, depending on the magnitude of non-deductible expenses in proportion to pretax results. 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 Our consolidated net income for 2009 was $121.6 million, or $3.36 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $135.9 million, or $3.74 per share, in 2008. Items that impact the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect timing of gain and loss recognition resulting from mark-to-mark et fuel hedge accounting. For 2009, we recognized net mark-to-market gains of $88.8 million ($55.2 million after tax, or $1.53 per share), compared to net losses of $142.3 million ($89.2 million after tax, or $2.46 per share) in 2008. 2009 included the new pilot contract transition costs of $35.8 million ($22.3 million after tax, or $0.62 per share). 2008 included fleet transition costs of $61.0 million ($38.2 million after tax, or $1.05 per share) related to the ongoing transitions out of the MD-80 and CRJ-700 fleets. 2008 included realized losses on the early termination of fuel-hedge contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 of $50 million ($31.3 million after tax, or $0.86 per share). 2008 included a $4 2.3 million benefit ($26.5 million after tax, or $0.73 per share) related to a change in the terms of our Mileage Plan program. 2008 included restructuring charges of $12.9 million ($8.1 million after tax, or $0.22 per share) related to the reduction in work force at Alaska. 39 Table of Contents ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS Excluding the items noted above, and as shown in the following table, our consolidated net income for 2009 was $88.7 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in 2008.

There was a 3.5% decline in PRASM, which was driven by a 6.0% drop in ticket yield compared to 2008, partially offset by a two-point increase in load factor. Passenger revenues were also bolstered by the implementation of our first-checked-bag fee in the third quarter of 2009 ($34.5 million) and the full-year impact of our second-checked-bag fee implemented in the third quarter of 2008, partially offset by a decline in other fees that resulted from fewer passengers. Freight and mail revenue decreased $7.8 million, or 7.9%, primarily as a result of lower mail volumes and yield and lower freight fuel surcharges because of the decline in fuel prices in 2009, partially offset by higher freight volumes and better freight pricing. Other net revenue increased $52.1 million, or 38.5%, from 2008. Mileage Plan revenue increased by $50.0 million primarily because of an increase in the rate paid to us by our credit card partner under the affinity card agreement and an increase in the number of miles needed to redeem a travel award. font> Passenger Revenue Purchased Capacity Passenger revenue purchased capacity flying fell by $12.4 million compared to 2008 because of a 2.6% decline in capacity combined with a 1.6% decrease in unit revenue compared to the prior year. Unit revenue dropped as a result of a 1.3-point decline in load factor on flat ticket yield. ALASKA EXPENSES For 2009, total operating expenses decreased $573.0 million or 17.1% compared to 2008 as a result of lower mainline operating costs, most notably aircraft fuel and fleet transition charges, partially offset by higher wages and benefits and new pilot contract transition costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Years Ended December 3 1 (in millions) 2009 2008 %Change Mainline fuel expense $ 549.0 $ 1,162.4 (52.8 ) Mainline non-fuel expenses 1,946.7 1,874.1 3.9ont> Mainline operating expenses $ 2,495.7 $ 3,036.5 (17.8 ) Purchased capacity costs 281.5 313.7 (10.3 ) Total Operating Expenses $ 2,777.2 $ 3,350.2 (17.1 ) Mainline Operating Expenses font> Total mainline operating expenses declined $540.8 million or 17.8% during 2009 compared to 2008.

The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 %Change Wages $ 540.4 $ 547.1 (1.2 ) Pension and defined-contribution retirement benefits 114.8 68.7 67.1 Medical benefits 83.3 72.3 15.2 Other benefits and payroll taxes 54.1 font> 54.6 (0.9 ) Total wages and benefits $ 792.6 $ 742.7 6.7 41 Table of Contents Wages declined 1.2% on a 7.4% reduction in FTEs compared to 2008. Wages did not decline in step with the FTE reduction because of higher wage rates for the pilot group in conne ction with their new contract and increased average wages for certain other employees stemming from higher average seniority. The 67.1% increase in pension and other retirement-related benefits was primarily due to a $45.0 million increase in our defined-benefit pension cost driven by the significant decline in the market value of pension assets at the end of 2008. Medical benefits increased 15.2% from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the post-retirement medical expense for the pilot group in connection with their n ew contract and an increase in overall medical costs. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $15.8 million in 2008 to $61.6 million in 2009. The increase is partially due to the fact that in 2009, our financial and operational results exceeded targets established by our Board. In 2008, our performance fell short of targets. The increase can also be attributed to the addition of Alaska's pilots, flight attendants and mechanics to the PBP incentive plan.ont> Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense declined $613.4 million, or 52.8%, compared to 2008. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: d> Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2009 2008 %Change Fuel gallons consumed 304.9 333.8 (8.7 ) Raw price per gallon $ 1.88 $ 3.31 (43.2 ) Total raw fuel expense $ 572.3 $ 1,103.8 (48.2 ) Net impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities (23.3 ) 58.6 NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 549.0 $ 1,162.4 (52.8 ) NM = Not Meaningful Fuel gallons consumed declined 8.7%, primarily as a result of a 6.6% reduction in aircraft flight hours and the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we completed the transition to newer, more fuel-efficient B737-800 aircraft in the second half of 2008. The raw fuel price per gallon declined 43.2% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices driven by lower crude oil costs and refining margins. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2009 2008 %Change Raw fuel expense $ 572.3 $ 1,103.8 t> (48.2 ) Plus or minus: net of cash received from settled hedges and premium expense recognized 50.4 (101.8 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 622.7 $ 1,002.0 (37.9 ) Fuel gallons consumed 304.9 333.8 (8.7 ) Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.05 $ 3.00 (31.7 ) NM = Not Meaningful As noted above, the total net expense recognized for hedges that settled during the period was $50.4 million in 2009, compared to a net cash benefit of $101.8 million in 2008. These amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement. The decrease is primarily due to the significant drop in crude oil prices from 2008. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance increased by $19.3 million, or 12.8%, compared to the prior year primarily because of a higher average cost of airframe maintenance events and a new power-by-the-hour (PBH) maintenance agreement on our B737-700 and B737-900 aircraft engines, partially offset by the benefits of our fleet transition, as we have replaced all of our aging MD-80s 42 Table of Contents with newer B737-800s, and lower PBH costs associated with our 737-400 aircraft engines that resulted from a decline in flight hours. Contracted Services Contracted services declined by $5.3 million, or 4.1%, compared to 2008 as a result of the reduction in the number of flights operated throughout our system to ports where vendors are used and a reduction in project contract labor. Selling Expenses Selling expenses declined by $11.3 million, or 9.7%, compared to 2008 as a result of lower revenue-related expenses such as credit card costs, travel agency commissions and ticket distribution costs that resulted from the decline in passenger traffic. Mileage Plan expenses were also lower because the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel was lower because of the decline in fuel costs. These declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $12.6 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2008. This is primarily due to the ten B737-800 aircraft delivered in 2009, partially offset by the sale-leaseback of six B737-800 aircraft in the first quarter of 2009. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses declined $15.1 million, or 8.9%, compared to the prior year. The decline is primarily driven by a reduction in outside professional services costs and flight crew-related costs such as hotels and per-diems. New Pilot Contract Transition Costs As mentioned previously, we recorded $35.8 million in connection with the new four-year contract ratified by Alaska pilots in the second quarter. Restructuring Charges and Fleet Transition Costs In the third quarter of 2008, we announced work force reductions among union and non-union employees. The affected non-union employees were terminated in the third quarter, resulting in a $1.6 million severance charge. For union personnel, we recorded an $11.3 million charge in 2008. During 2008, we retired four MD-80 aircraft that were under long-term lease arrangements and placed them in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility. The $47.5 million charge in 2008 represented the remaining discounted lease payments under the lease contracts and our estimate of maintenance costs that will be incurred in the future to meet the minimum return conditions under the lease requirements. Mainline Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our mainline operating costs per mainline ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 tr> 2009 2008 % Change Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM ) 10.78 12.54 (14.0 ) Less the following components: Aircraft fuel costs per ASM 2.37 4.80 (50.6 ) New pilot contract transition costs per ASM 0.15 NM Restructuring costs per ASM 0.05 NM Fleet transition charges per ASM 0.20 NM CASM, excluding fuel and noted items 8.26 7.49 10.2 NM = Not Meaningful CASM, excluding fuel and noted items increased from the prior-year period because of the increase in wages and benefits and other expenses as discussed above, partially offset by a 4.4% reduction in capacity. 43 Table of Contents Purchased Capacity Costs Purchased capacity costs decreased $32.2 million compared to 2008. Of the total, $261.7 million was paid to Horizon under the CPA for 1.4 billion ASMs. This expense is eliminated in consolidation. HORIZON AIR Horizon reported pretax income of $22.8 million in 2009 compared to a pretax loss of $55.8 million in 2008. The improvement is primarily due to declines in aircraft fuel costs and non-fuel operating expenses, partially offset by a $79.5 million decline in operating revenues. Excluding the items noted in the table below, Horizon would have reported pretax income of $7.7 million in 2009 compared to a pretax loss of $10.4 million in 2008. See the previous discussion under Adjusted Non-GAAP Earnings and Per-Share Amounts for additional information about these non-GAAP measures. Year Ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008 Income (loss) before income taxes, excluding items below $ 7.7 $ (10.4 ) Fleet transition costs CRJ-700 (13.5 ) Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments 15.1 (23.4 ) Realized losses on hedge portfolio restructuring (8.5 ) Income (loss) before income taxes as reported $ 22.8 $ (55.8 ) HORIZON REVENUES During 2009, operating revenues decreased 10.8% compared to 2008. Horizon passenger revenues are summarized in the following table: (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 Revenues % ASMs Revenues % ASMs Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying $ 381.9 59 nt> $ 429.2 59 Revenue from capacity purchase arrangements (CPA) with Alaska 261.7 41 293.7 41 Total passenger revenue and % of ASMs $ 643.6 100 % $ 722.9 100 % Line-of-business information is presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Capacity and Mix Load Factor Yield RASM Actual (in millions) % Change Y-O-Y Current % Total Actual Point Change Y-O-Y Actual % Change Y-O-Y Actual % Change Y-O-Y Brand Flying 1,927 (13.2 ) 59 72.4 % 1.3 27.36 0.6 20.38 2.8 Alaska CPA 1,365 (2.2 ) 41 NM NM NM NM td> 19.17 (8.9 ) System Total 3,292 (9.0 ) 100 73.1 % 0.2 td> 26.73 (2.6 ) v> 19.88 (2.0 ) NM = Not Meaningful Passenger revenue from Horizon brand flying fell $47.3 million, or 11.0%, on a 13.2% reduction in brand capacity, partially offset by a 2.8% improvement in unit revenue. The increase in unit revenue was due to the slight improvements in both load factor and ticket yield. Revenue from CPA flying performed on behalf of Alaska totaled $261.7 million during 2009 compared to $293.7 million during 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 2.2% reduction in capacity provided under this arrangement and a significant decline in the associated fuel cost, which was reimbursed by Alaska. This revenue is eliminated in consolidation. HORIZON EXPENSES Total operating expenses decreased $161.1 million, or 20.8%, as compared to 2008. The sharp decline in fuel costs was the primary driver of the overall decrease. Significant period-over-period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows. 44 Table of Contents Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits declined $8.9 million, or 4.6%, compared to 2008. The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions) 2009 2008ont> %Change Wages $ 132.3 $ 142.2 (7.0 ) Medical benefits 20.6 19.5 5.6 Other benefits and payroll taxes 32.3 32.4 (0.3 ) Total wages and benefits $ 185.2 &nbsp ; $ 194.1 (4.6 ) Wages declined 7% primarily as a result of a 10.6% decline in the number of full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by slightly h igher wages per employee. The increase in average wages per employee is due to a higher average employee seniority level as furloughs involved less senior employees. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $14.4 million during 2009 from $5.6 million in 2008, of which $8.6 million and $1 million was related to PBP in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Variable pay increased for the same performance reasons cited in the Alaska discussion and the addition of Horizon flight attendants a nd non-represented employees into Air Group PBP plan. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel declined $126.9 million, or 53.8%, compared to the same period in 2008. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2009 2008 %Change Fuel gallons consumed 60.1 66.9 (10.2 ) Raw price per gall on $ 1.90 $ 3.36 (43.5 ) Total raw fuel expense $ 113.9 $ 225.0 (49.4 ) Net impact on fuel expense from (gains) and losses arising from fuel-hedging activities (4.8 ) 11.0 NM Aircraft fuel expense $ 109.1 $ 236.0 (53.8 ) NM = Not Meaningful The 10.2% reduction in gallons consumed is primarily a fu nction of the capacity reductions in 2009 compared to the prior year. The raw fuel price per gallon declined by 43.5% as a result of the drop in crude oil prices and refining margins. Our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows: Years Ended December 31 (in millions, except per-gallon amounts) 2009 2008 %Change Raw fuel expense $ 113.9 $ 225.0 (49.4 ) Plus or minus: net of cash received from settled hedges and premium expense recognized 10.3 (20.9 ) NM Economic fuel expense $ 124.2 $ 204.1 d> (39.1 ) Fuel gallons consumed 60.1 66.9 (10.2 ) Economic fuel cost per gallon $ 2.07 $ 3.05 (32.1 ) NM = Not Meaningful The total net expense recognized for hedges that settled during the period was $10.3 million in 2009, compared to a net cash benefit of $20.9 million in 2008. These amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement. 45 Table of Contents Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent expense declined $12.2 million, or 21.4%, as a result of the complete transition out of the Q200 fleet, all of which were leased, and the sublease of two CRJ-700 aircraft in late 2008. Fleet Transition Costs Fleet transition costs associated with the removal of Q200 aircraft from the operating fleet were $8.8 million during 2009 compared to $10.2 million in 2008. All Q200 aircraft have been removed from the operating fleet. During 2008, as a result of our decision to retire the CRJ-700 fleet earlier than expected, we recorded a $5.5 million impairment charge associated with the two owned CRJ-700 aircraft and related spare parts, $6.7 million associated with a net loss on the sublease arrangement for two leased CRJ-700 aircraft, and a $1.3 million severance charge associated with the fleet reduction. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM) Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 %Change Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 18.64 21.42 (13.0 ) CASM includes the following components: Fuel costs per ASM 3.31 6.53 (49.3 ) CRJ-700 fleet transition costs per ASM 0.37 NM CASM, excluding fuel and noted items 15.33 14.52 5.5 Q200 fleet transition costs per ASM 0.27 0.28 NM NM = Not Meaningful CONSOLIDATED NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Net nonoperating expense was $64.5 million in 2009 compared to $41.0 million in 2008. Interest income declined $9.8 million compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower average portfolio returns, partially offset by a higher average balance of cash and marketable securities. Interest expense declined $0.5 million on lower average interest rates on our variable-rate debt on a relatively stable average debt balance. Capitalized interest was $15.6 million lower than in 2008 because of lower advance aircraft purchase deposits and the deferred future aircraft deliveries. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income or loss for 2009 was 40.1%, compared to 36.3% for 2008. The difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our 2009 marginal tax rate of approximately 37.9% is primarily the magnitude of nondeductible expenses, such as employee per-diem costs and stock-based compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESnt> The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A is based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and th at potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. 46 Table of Contents MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners. Additionally, we sell miles to third parties, such as our bank partner, for cash. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense for the obligation to provide travel in the future. For miles sold to third parties, the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided. The commission component of these sales proceeds (defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer) is recorded as other-net revenue in the period that miles are sold and represents services provided by the Company to its business partners and relates primarily to the use of the Company's logo and trademarks along with access to the Company's Mileage Plan members. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $123.7 million, $96.8 million and $57.0 million, re spectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2010 , we had approximately 117 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $673.9 million. Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in estimates; therefore, an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles: We defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel. As our estimates of fair value change, the amount we defer changes, resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period. A 1% increase in the estimated fair value of travel awards (and related deferral rate) would decrease commission revenue by approximately $2 million. This amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place. td> 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimates of the n umber of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) consider historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. A hypothetical 1.0% change in our estimate of breakage (currently 12% in the aggregate) has approximately a $7.0 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award (i.e., free ticket): able> We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical travel redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corr esponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her a ward ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often 47 Table of Contents nt> substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review signif icant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS Accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in othe r comprehensive income. Pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $50.2 million , $93.0 million , and $48.0 million in 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 , respectively. We expect the 2011 expense to be approximately $44 million. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experie nce can differ from these assumptions. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2010 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75%. This rate was developed using historical data, the current value of the underlying assets, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2010 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed-income securities. Decreasing the expected long-term rate of return by 0.5% (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would increase our estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately $5.7 million. Pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 5.55% and 5.85% at December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively. The discount rate at December 31, 2010 was determined using current rates earned on high-quality long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans. Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5% (from 5.55% to 5.05%) would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 by approximately $97.7 million and increase estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately $9.1 million. All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2010 , we had approximately $3.1 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expec ted residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. In 2008, Horizon announced plans to ultimately exit its CRJ-700 fleet and transition to an all-Q400 fleet. As a result of the decision, we determined that the two owned CRJ-700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of $5.5 million in 2008 to reduc e the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft. 48 Table of Contents PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued AS U 2009-13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. This update provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting. This guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. This accounting standard is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2011 and will change our accounting for recognition of revenue associated with frequent flyer credits. Management does not believe that there will be an immediat e significant impact of this new standard on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures. Recently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued a number of proposed Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs). Those proposed ASUs are as follows: Proposed ASU - Revenue Recognition - was issued in June 2010 and continues to evolve. We believe that a new revenue recognition standard could significantly impact the Company's accounting for the Company's Mileage Plan miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our partners, or miles sold to third parties. &n bsp; Proposed ASU - Leases - was issued in August 2010. This proposed standard overhauls accounting for leases and will apply a right-of-use model in accounting for nearly all leases. For lessees, this will result in recognizing an asset representing the lessee's right to use the leased asset for the lease term and a liability to make lease payments. This proposed standard eliminates the operating lease concept from an accounting perspective, thereby eliminating rent expense from the income statement. This proposed standard, if adopted, will significantly impact the Company's statement of operations, financial position, and disclosures. For example, we estimate the capitalized value of airplane leases to be approximately $1.0 bi llion using a seven times annual rent factor. These proposed ASUs are currently in comment period and are subject to change. There are no effective dates assigned to these proposals. In July 2010, the FASB also issued an initial draft of new financial statement presentation requirements. These new requirements, as currently drafted, would substantially change the way financial statements are presented by disaggregating information in financial statements to explain the components of its financial position and financial performance. These changes will impact the presentation of the financial statements only and are not expected to impact the Company's overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.2 billion (which represents 32% of trailing 12 months revenue) and our expected cash from operations; Aircraft financing the 18 unencumbered aircraft in our operating fleet that could be financed, if necessary; &n bsp; Our combined $200 million bank line-of-credit facilities (currently nothing outstanding); Other potential sources such as a forward sale of mileage credits to our bank partner. Because of the recent economic recession, we intentionally increased our cash and marketable securities to current levels (roughly 32% of trailing 12 months revenues). In 2010, we paid off outstanding debt associated with six B737-800 aircraft and a portion of a seventh aircraft loan totaling $169.2 million. Subsequent to the end of 2010, we paid off outstanding balances on two additional aircraft loans totaling $51.8 million. In addition, we repurchased $45.1 million of our common stock in 2010 and have $31.2 million remaining to repurchase under our existing $50 million Board authorization. Finally, we made a voluntary contribution to our defined-benefit pension plans of $100 million in December 2010, bringing our total pension contributions to $145.6 million in 2010. We will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in U.S. government securities, certain asset-backed obligations and corporate debt securities. We do not invest in equities or auction-rate securities. As of December 31, 2010 , we had a $12.8 million net unrealized gain on our $1.2 billion cash and marketable securities balance. Our overall investment strategy for our marketable securities portfolio has a primary goal of maintaining and securing its investment principal. Our investment portfolio is managed by reputable financial institutions and is continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: (in millions, except per-share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 1,208.2 $ 1,192.1 $ 16.1 Cash and marketable securities as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 32 % 35 % (3) pts Long-term debt, net of current portion 1,313.0 1,699.2 (386.2 ) Shareholders equity 1,105.4 872.1 233.3 Long-term debt-to-capital assuming aircraft operating leases are capitalized at seven times annualized rent 67%:33% 76%:24% (9) pts The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities During 2010 , net cash provided by operating activities was $553.7 million , compared to $292.5 million during 2009 . The $261.2 million increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, growth in the air traffic liability and a decline in paid income taxes compared to the prior year. The increases were partially offset by the payment of 2009 incentive pay in the first quarter of 2010, which was significantly larger than the payment of 2008 incentive pay in 2009. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, but historically have consumed substantially all of that cash plus additional debt proceeds for capital expenditures and debt payments. In 2010, however, we had much lower capital expenditures than in the past several years due to fewer aircraft deliveries. Cash Used in Investing Activities Our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures and, to a lesser extent, purchases and sales of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $295.2 million during 2010 , compared to $657.4 million in 2009 . Our capital expenditures were $183.0 million , or $255.4 million lower than in 2009 due to fewer aircraft purchases and advance deposits. We currently expect capital expenditures for 2011 to be as follows (in millions): 2011 Aircraft-related $ 330 Non-aircraft 55nt> Total Air Group $ 385 The expected increase in capital expenditures from 2010 is due to payments associated with the deliveries of three B737-800 aircraft, eight Q400 aircraft, and the advance deposits related to the new Boeing aircraft order discussed later under "Aircraft Purchase Commitments". We preliminarily expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $370 million. font> Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities was $333.2 million during 2010 compared to net cash provided of $246.0 million during 2009 . The change is primarily due to proceeds from the sale-leaseback transactions on six B737-800 aircraft and debt proceeds 50 Table of Contents in 2009 compared to no borrowings in 2010, combined with $169.2 million of debt prepayment in 2010. Additionally, we repurchased $45.1 million of our common stock in 2010, compared to $23.8 million repurchased in 2009. We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Line-of-Credit Facility We terminated our previous $185 million credit facility effective March 30, 2010. That facility was replaced with two new $100 million credit facilities. Both facilities have variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. Borrowings on one of the $100 million facilities, which expires in March 2013, are secured by aircraft. Borrowings on the other $100 million facility, which expires in March 2014, are secured by certain accounts receivable, spare engines, spare parts and ground service equipment. There are no outstanding balances on these facilities at December 31, 2010 . We have no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities. See Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Pre-delivery Payment Facility We terminated our pre-delivery payment facility in the second quarter of 2010. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at the time of termination. See Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for furt her discussion. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments In January 2011, we executed an aircraft purchase agreement with Boeing fo r 15 new B737 aircraft, two 737-800 aircraft and 13 new B737-900ER aircraft, with deliveries starting late in 2012 and going through 2014. The agreement also includes options for 15 additional B737-900ER aircraft with delivery positions in 2016 and 2017. The firm orders mentioned above were inclusive of the conversion of eleven existing options. For purposes of the aircraft purchase commitment table below, we are including the recent aircraft transactions and their related obligations. All other obligations are as of December 31, 2010 . Overall, we had firm orders to purchase 36 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately $1,150.9 million , as set forth below. Alaska has options to acquire 42 additional B737s and Horizon has options to acquire 10 Q400s. The following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year, including the January aircraft order: Aircraft Delivery Period - Firm Orders 2011 2012 2013 2014 Beyond 2014 Total Boeing 737-800 3 6 3 1 2 15 Boeing 737-900ER 6 7 13 Bombardier Q400 8 &nbsp ; 8 Total 11 6 9 8 2 36 Payments (millions)* $ 331.8 $ 315.0 $ 297.7 $ 167.0 $ 39.4 $ 1,150.9 * Includes pre-delivery payments to Boeing and Bombardier as well as final aircraft payments. We expect to pay for the three B737-800 aircraft deliveries in 2011 with cash on hand and the eight Q400 aircraft with long-term debt financing. We expect to pay for firm orders beyond 2011 and the option aircraft, if exercised, through internally generated cash, long-term debt, or operating lease arrangements. 51 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2010 . The ai rcraft purchase commitments in the table below do not reflect the January 2011 aircraft order: (in millions) 2011 2012 2013 d> 2014 2015 Beyond 2015 Total Current and long-term debt obligations $ 221.2 $ 216.9 $ 175.7 $ 141.9 $ 128.2 $ 650.3 $ 1,534.2 Operating lease commitments (1) 214.5 197.4 157.8 140.0 t> 106.7 285.5 1,101.9 Aircraft purchase commitments 238.4 112.5 79.7 59.6 34.6 4.8 529.6 div> Interest obligations (2) 77.4 69.8 58.0 49.7 42.8 111.1 408.8 Other obligations (3) 51.9 52.2 42.2 54.3 200.6 Total $ 803.4 $ 648.8 $ 513.4 $ 445.5 $ 312.3 $ 1,051.7 $ 3,775.1 (1) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. The aircraft operating leases include lease obligations for 16 leased Q200 aircraft and three CRJ-700 aircraft, all of which are no longer in our operating fleets. We have accrued for these lease commitments based on their discounted future cash flows as we remain obligated under the existing lease contracts on these aircraft. (2) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2010 . (3) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements for all B737 engines other than the B737-800. Pension Obligations The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which could be approximately $35 million to $50 million per year based on our historical funding practice, although there is no minimum required contribution in 2011. In both 2010 and 2009, we made year-end voluntary supplemental pension contributions of $100 million, bringing the funding total in both years to approximately $300 million. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $200.3 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $272.9 million at December 31, 2009 . This results in a 85.1% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 76.9% funded as of December 31, 2009 . Los Angeles International Airport Improvements In 2009, we announced plans to move from Terminal 3 to Terminal 6 at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). As part of this move, we have agreed to manage and fund up to $175 million of the project during the design and construction phase. The project is e stimated to cost approximately $250 million and is expected to be completed in 2012. We expect Los Angeles World Airports and the Transportation Security Administration to reimburse us for the majority of the construction costs either during the course of, or upon the completion of, construction. We are currently working with the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports on a funding agreement and expect to have it finalized in the near future. We anticipate that our proprietary share will be approximately $25 million of the total cost of the project. As of December 31, 2010, we capitalized $34 million associated with this project, which represents total project costs to date. Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement. Under another such agreement, we would be obligated to maintain a reserve if our cash balance fell below $350 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. EFFECT OF INFLATION AND PRICE CHANGES Inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income and did not have such an effect in the last three fiscal years. 52 Table of Contents RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL font> We strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business. Our target return on invested capital (ROIC) is 10%. We surpassed this goal in 2010, but have not historically reached this threshold on average over our business cycle. Our strategic plan is built on the premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers, which we believe is a 10% average return.
