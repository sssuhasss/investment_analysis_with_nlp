Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Certain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details about these statements. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Concho legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends. We are actively developing our resource base by utilizing extended length lateral drilling, enhanced completion techniques, multi-well pad locations and large-scale development projects throughout our four core operating areas: the Northern Delaware Basin, the Southern Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin and the New Mexico Shelf. Oil comprised 60 percent of our 840 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 and 62 percent of our 70 MMBoe of production for 2017. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 92 percent of our proved developed producing reserves and 79 percent of our 8,152 gross wells at December 31, 2017. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. 45 Financial and Operating Performance Our financial and operating performance for 2017 included the following highlights: Net income was $ 956 million ($6.41 per diluted share) as compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion ($ (10.85) per diluted share) in 2016. The increase was primarily due to: no recorded impairments of long-lived assets in 2017, as compared to $1.5 billion in non-cash impairment charges in 2016 primarily attributable to properties in our New Mexico Shelf area; $951 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues as a result of a 28 percent increase in production and a 24 percent increase in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities) ; $560 million increase in gain on disposition of assets, net due to a gain of approximately $678 million during 2017 primarily attributable to our disposition of ACC, as compared to a gain of approximately $118 million during 2016 primarily attributable to our Northern Delaware Basin divestiture in February 2016 ; $243 million decrease in the loss on derivatives; and $21 million decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to a decrease in the depletion rate per Boe, partially offset by an increase in production; partially offset by: $801 million change in our income tax provision primarily due to favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA, resulting in a provisional discrete income tax benefit of approximately $398 million. This benefit more than offset the $308 million income tax expense on income before taxes during 2017 at the federal statutory rate; $88 million increase in production expense, primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017 and (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017; and $68 million increase in production and ad valorem tax expense, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased oil and natural gas sales. Average daily sales volumes increased by 28 percent from 150,511 Boe per day during 2016 to 192,658 Boe per day during 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $311 million to $1,695 million for 2017, as compared to $1,384 m illion in 2016, primarily due to increased oil and natural gas revenues and decreased cash interest expense, partially offset by (i) decreased cash settlements on derivatives, (ii) increased production expense and (iii) increased production tax expense. Cash decreased by approximately $53 million during 2017 primarily as a result of cash paid to tender and extinguish the 5.5% Notes and cash paid for the Midland Basin and Northern Delaware Basin acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes and proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC. 46 Commodity Prices Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of the factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Notes 8 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2017 and additional derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2017, respectively. Oil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. The average oil and natural gas prices were higher during 2017 compared to 2016. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the high and low NYMEX prices for the same periods: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Average NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl) $ 50.97 $ 43.42 $ 48.84 Natural gas (MMBtu) $ 3.02 $ 2.56 $ 2.63 High and Low NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl): High $ 60.42 $ 54.06 $ 61.43 Low $ 42.53 $ 26.21 $ 34.73 Natural gas (MMBtu): High $ 3.72 $ 3.93 $ 3.23 Low $ 2.56 $ 1.64 $ 1.76 Further, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $66.14 and $59.19 per Bbl and $3.63 and $2.55 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2018 to February 16, 2018. At February 16, 2018, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $61.68 per Bbl and $2.56 per MMBtu, respectively. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Potential cost inflation . Oilfield service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. As companies have expanded their drilling and development activities during 2017, the demand for third-party oilfield services and suppliers has also increased. As such, if the commodity price environment continues to trend upward, we expect demand for oilfield services and supplies to continue to grow, and the costs of drilling, equipping and operating our wells and infrastructure could begin to rise. 47 Recent Events 2018 capital budget. In February 2018, we announced our 2018 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $2.0 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Approximately 93 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2018 capital program is expected to continue focusing on large-scale project development. Our 2018 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. Our budget could change depending on numerous factors, including commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions. Tax reform. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States ( the President ) signed into law the TCJA, significantly changing corporate income tax laws. According to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) section 740, Income Taxes, a company is required to record the effects of an enacted tax law or rate change in income from continuing operations in the period of enactment, which is the date the bill is signed by the President and becomes law. We note that certain aspects of these changes will impact our future after-tax earnings primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118 ) to provide guidance for companies that have not completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment. SAB 118 allows companies to report provisional amounts when based on reasonable estimates and to adjust these amounts during a measurement period of up to one year. Although we have performed an initial assessment of the TCJA, we recognize that it is a comprehensive bill and the ultimate impacts may differ from our initial estimates due to changes in our interpretations as a result of additional regulatory guidance that may become available. As such, we have elected to apply SAB 118 and have recorded, based on reasonable estimates, provisional amounts of our income tax balances reported in our financial statements. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our income tax balances. As we continue to refine our analysis of the tax law changes and monitor new tax law interpretation, any adjustments to our provisional amounts identified during the measurement period will be included as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the period these amounts are determined. Southern Delaware Basin divestitures. In January 2018, we closed on two asset sales transactions of certain non-core assets in Reeves and Ward Counties with combined preliminary proceeds of approximately $280 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, we received cash deposits totaling approximately $29 million for the asset sales, which was included in the total cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding these divestitures. February 2018 nonmonetary transaction. In February 2018, we closed on a strategic trade where we received approximately 21,000 net acres, primarily located in the Midland Basin, with current production of 5 MBoepd in exchange for 34,000 net acres, primarily comprised of approximately 32,000 net acres in the northern Delaware Basin, with current production of 3 MBoepd. 48 Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net liability of $379 million. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. The terms of our credit facility do not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. In September 2017, we elected to enter into an Investment Grade Period under our credit facility, which had the effect of releasing all collateral formerly securing the credit facility and derivative obligations. See Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. New commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2017, we entered into the following oil price swaps, oil basis swaps and natural gas price swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total Oil Price Swaps: (a) 2018: Volume (Bbl) 915,000 1,213,000 1,013,000 674,000 3,815,000 Price per Bbl $ 63.64 $ 63.48 $ 63.34 $ 63.11 $ 63.42 2019: Volume (Bbl) 876,000 748,000 636,000 552,000 2,812,000 Price per Bbl $ 58.14 $ 58.12 $ 58.10 $ 58.08 $ 58.11 2020: Volume (Bbl) 1,001,000 1,001,000 1,012,000 1,012,000 4,026,000 Price per Bbl $ 54.80 $ 54.80 $ 54.80 $ 54.80 $ 54.80 Oil Basis Swaps: (b) 2018: Volume (Bbl) 615,000 637,000 399,000 306,000 1,957,000 Price per Bbl $ 0.13 $ 0.06 $ (0.07) $ (0.10) $ 0.03 2019: Volume (Bbl) 180,000 182,000 184,000 - 546,000 Price per Bbl $ (0.27) $ (0.27) $ (0.27) $ - $ (0.27) 2020: Volume (Bbl) 2,184,000 2,184,000 2,208,000 2,208,000 8,784,000 Price per Bbl $ (0.09) $ (0.09) $ (0.09) $ (0.09) $ (0.09) Natural Gas Price Swaps: (c) 2018: Volume (MMBtu) 1,277,000 878,000 921,000 274,000 3,350,000 Price per MMBtu $ 3.08 $ 3.08 $ 3.08 $ 3.08 $ 3.08 (a) The index prices for the oil price swaps are based on the NYMEX WTI monthly average futures price. (b) The basis differential price is between Midland WTI and Cushing WTI. (c) The index prices for the natural gas price swaps are based on the NYMEX Henry Hub last trading day futures price. 49 Results of Operations The following table sets forth summary information concerning our production and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from the Reliance Acquisition for periods prior to October 2016. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities, fluctuations in commodity prices and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 43,472 33,840 34,457 Natural gas (MMcf) 161,089 127,481 106,987 Total (MBoe) 70,320 55,087 52,288 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 119,101 92,459 94,403 Natural gas (Mcf) 441,340 348,309 293,115 Total (Boe) 192,658 150,511 143,256 Average prices per unit: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 48.13 $ 39.90 $ 44.69 Oil, with derivatives (Bbl) (a) $ 49.93 $ 57.90 $ 62.03 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 3.07 $ 2.23 $ 2.46 Natural gas, with derivatives (Mcf) (a) $ 3.06 $ 2.36 $ 2.80 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 36.78 $ 29.68 $ 34.49 Total, with derivatives (Boe) (a) $ 37.88 $ 41.03 $ 46.60 Operating costs and expenses per Boe: (b) Oil and natural gas production $ 5.80 $ 5.81 $ 7.46 Production and ad valorem taxes $ 2.82 $ 2.38 $ 2.90 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 16.29 $ 21.19 $ 23.40 General and administrative $ 3.46 $ 4.09 $ 4.42 (a) Includes the effect of net cash receipts from derivatives: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Net cash receipts from derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 79 $ 609 $ 597 Natural gas derivatives - 16 36 Total $ 79 $ 625 $ 633 The presentation of average prices with derivatives is a result of including the net cash receipts from commodity derivatives that are presented in our statements of cash flows. This presentation of average prices with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective periods and presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives in a manner consistent with the presentation generally used by the investment community. (b) Per Boe amounts calculated using dollars and volumes rounded to thousands. 50 The following table presents selected production data for the fields which represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Production: South Basin Wolfcamp Bone Spring: Oil (MMBbl) 12 11 10 Natural gas (Bcf) 75 56 37 Total (MMBoe) 25 20 16 Midland Basin Spraberry-Wolfcamp: Oil (MMBbl) 8 6 (a) Natural gas (Bcf) 26 20 (a) Total (MMBoe) 12 9 (a) Yeso: Oil (MMBbl) 7 7 7 Natural gas (Bcf) 28 27 27 Total (MMBoe) 12 12 12 (a) Represented less than 15% of the Company's total proved reserves for the year indicated. 51 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $2,586 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of $951 million (58 percent ) from $1,635 million for 2016 . This increase was primarily due to the increase in realized oil and natural gas production as well as the increase in oil and natural gas prices (excluding the effects of derivative activities). Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 43,472 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of 9,632 MBbl (28 percent ) from 33,840 MBbl for 2016 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $48.13 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of 21 percent from $39.90 per Bbl during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(2.84) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 94 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2016. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.30 per Bbl and $0.15 per Bbl, respectively. Additionally, we incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. These fixed deductions were less per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to more production transported through pipelines and successful renegotiation of fixed deductions for trucked volumes; total natural gas production was 161,089 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of 33,608 MMcf (26 percent ) from 127,481 MMcf for 2016 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $3.07 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of 38 percent from $2.23 per Mcf during 2016 . For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , we realized approximately 102 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. The increase in our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 52 Oil and natural gas production expenses. The following table provides the components of our oil and natural gas production expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 387 $ 5.50 $ 301 $ 5.46 Workover costs 21 0.30 19 0.35 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 408 $ 5.80 $ 320 $ 5.81 Lease operating expenses were $387 million ($5.50 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017 , which was an increase of $86 million (29 percent) from $301 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017, (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017, particularly our Reliance Acquisition and our Midland Basin acquisition, whose associated properties incur higher lease operating expense per Boe than our legacy assets and (iii) increased cost of services. Production and ad valorem taxes. The following table provides the components of our production and ad valorem tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Production taxes $ 181 $ 2.58 $ 117 $ 2.13 Ad valorem taxes 18 0.24 14 0.25 Total production and ad valorem taxes $ 199 $ 2.82 $ 131 $ 2.38 Production taxes per unit of production were $2.58 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of 21 percent from $2.13 per Boe during 2016 . Over the same period, our revenue per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 24 percent. The increase in production taxes per unit of production was directly related to the increase in oil and natural gas sales, partially offset by a $5 million tax credit received during 2017 related to certain wells in Texas qualifying for reduced severance tax rates, as compared to $4 million in tax credit received during 2016. Production taxes fluctuate with the market value of our production sold, while ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and natural gas properties at the beginning of the year, which vary across the different areas in which we operate. 53 Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Geological and geophysical $ 13 $ 8 Exploratory dry hole costs - 7 Leasehold abandonments 27 50 Other 19 12 Total exploration and abandonments $ 59 $ 77 Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. We did not recognize any exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 . For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded approximately $29 million and $60 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) acreage expiring in our Southern Delaware Basin core area and (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas in locations where we have no future plans to drill. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas that, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin areas. Our other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 1,122 $ 15.95 $ 1,145 $ 20.79 Depreciation of other property and equipment 21 0.29 21 0.37 Amortization of intangible assets 3 0.05 1 0.03 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 1,146 $ 16.29 $ 1,167 $ 21.19 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 47.79 $ 39.25 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 2.98 $ 2.48 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,122 million ($15.95 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $23 million (2 percent) from $1,145 million ($20.79 per Boe) for 2016. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) lower drilling and completion costs per Boe of proved developed reserves added, (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition as well as other acquisitions, and higher commodity prices, partially offset by decreased proved reserves caused by reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (iii) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016. 54 Impairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We estimate undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2017, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2018 price of $59.55 per barrel of oil decreasing to a 2024 price of $51.82 per barrel of oil marginally recovering to a 2025 price of $51.83 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2018 price of $2.84 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2019 price of $2.81 per Mcf then rising to a 2025 price of $2.99 per Mcf of natural gas. Both oil and natural gas commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2025. We estimate fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2023. We did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2017. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. We estimate that if the future oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis, and noted above, would have been approximately 10 percent lower at December 31, 2017 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve performance curves, no impairment would be indicated. Other assumptions such as operating costs, well and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes, and operating and development plans would likely change given a change in oil and natural gas prices. However, we did not estimate the correlation between these assumptions and any estimated commodity price change, and these and other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the effects of a reduction in commodity prices, including the ultimate impact and amount of any potential impairment charge. As a result, we are unable to predict with certainty whether or not a decline in commodity prices alone will or will not cause us to recognize an impairment charge in a particular field or the magnitude of any such impairment charge. We additionally note that there may be changes to both drilling and completion designs that affect the volume curves, capital costs estimates, and the amount of proved undeveloped locations that can be recorded, each of which will affect management estimates of future cash flows. 55 General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 200 $ 2.85 $ 184 $ 3.33 Less: Operating fee reimbursements (16) (0.24) (17) (0.31) Non-cash stock-based compensation 60 0.85 59 1.07 Total general and administrative expenses $ 244 $ 3.46 $ 226 $ 4.09 General and administrative expenses were approximately $244 million ($3.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017 , an increase of $18 million (8 percent) from $226 million ($4.09 per Boe) for 2016 . The increase in cash general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased compensation expense. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to increased production, partially offset by the increase in cash general and administrative costs noted above. We receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of approximately $16 million and $17 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Gain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Gain (loss) on derivatives: Oil derivatives $ (172) $ (337) Natural gas derivatives 46 (32) Total $ (126) $ (369) The following table represents our net cash receipts from derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Net cash receipts from derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 79 $ 609 Natural gas derivatives - 16 Total $ 79 $ 625 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains; while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Gain on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $678 million and $118 million, respectively. In February 2017, we closed on the 56 divestiture of our ownership interest in ACC. After adjustments for debt and working capital, we received cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $801 million. After direct transaction costs, we recorded a pre-tax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $655 million. Our net investment in ACC at the time of closing was approximately $129 million. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Interest expense, as reported $ 146 $ 204 Capitalized interest 3 - Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest $ 149 $ 204 Weighted average interest rate credit facility 3.5% - Weighted average interest rate senior notes 5.0% 5.9% Total weighted average interest rate 5.0% 5.9% Weighted average credit facility balance $ 100 $ - Weighted average senior notes balance 2,658 3,182 Total weighted average debt balance $ 2,758 $ 3,182 Our weighted average debt balance decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to (i) the satisfaction and discharge of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, (ii) the redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and (iii) the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes in September 2017, partially offset by (i) the issuance of the 4.375% Notes in December 2016, (ii) the issuance of the 2017 Notes in September 2017 and (iii) an increase in borrowings under our credit facility. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance and an increase in capitalized interest. Loss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . This amount includes: (i) approximately $36 million associated with the premium paid for the Tender Offer, approximately $25 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 5.5% Notes, approximately $21 million of unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $2 million of additional interest on the 5.5% Notes to October 13, 2017, which was paid in September 2017, reduced by approximately $19 million of unamortized premium; and (ii) approximately $1 million representing the proportional amount of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with banks that are no longer in the credit facility syndicate as a result of the April 2017 credit facility amendment. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes: (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs. Income tax provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , we recorded an income tax benefit of $75 million, which includes discrete provisional income tax benefits of approximately $398 million related to the enactment of the TCJA and $6 million related to stock-based awards recorded in the income tax provision pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09 adopted on January 1, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $876 million primarily due to having a loss before income taxes. The change in our income tax provision in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA in December 2017 as the income tax benefit related to the federal statutory rate change more than offset our income tax expense of $308 million on income before income taxes during 2017. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (9) percent and 38 percent, respectively. The 2017 rate was negative due to recognizing an overall income tax benefit while having pre-tax income. As we continue to implement and address the ongoing impacts of the TCJA, we may determine it necessary in the future to adjust our income tax calculations due to changes in our initial interpretations or assumptions . As we have elected to apply 57 SAB 118, adjustments to provisional amounts included in the total income tax benefit are allowable during the one-year measurement period. We will continue to monitor new tax law interpretations. We evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In February 2017, we sold our ownership interest in ACC, which consisted of property in both Texas and New Mexico, and in April 2017, we completed an acquisition of assets in the Northern Delaware Basin. We have considered these and other factors and did not identify a shift in our projected future apportionment between New Mexico and Texas for the year ended December 31, 2017. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 58 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,635 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $169 million (9 percent) from $1,804 million for 2015 . This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in natural gas production. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 33,840 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of 617 MBbl (2 percent ) from 34,457 MBbl for 2015 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $39.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of 11 percent from $44.69 per Bbl during 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(4.15) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2015. We incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. Additionally, the basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.15 per Bbl and $0.41 per Bbl, respectively; total natural gas production was 127,481 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2016 , an increase of 20,494 MMcf (19 percent ) from 106,987 MMcf for 2015 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $2.23 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of 9 percent from $2.46 per Mcf during 2015 . For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we realized approximately 87 percent and 94 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Factors contributing to the decrease in our realized gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 were (i) a decrease in the posted regional natural gas prices on which we are paid while the NYMEX natural gas price decreased at a lesser rate and (ii) increased deductions and fees from the regional natural gas price, comparatively. Over the past three years, approximately half of our total natural gas revenues have been derived from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $18.08 per Bbl and $17.80 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 59 Oil and natural gas production expenses. The following table provides the components of our oil and natural gas production expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 301 $ 5.46 $ 362 $ 6.93 Workover costs 19 0.35 28 0.53 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 320 $ 5.81 $ 390 $ 7.46 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices. Lease operating expenses were $301 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of $61 million (17 percent) from $362 million ($6.93 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) implementation of operational cost efficiencies and (ii) an overall decrease in the cost of goods and services. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in lease operating expenses noted above coupled with a slight increase in production. Workover expenses were approximately $19 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to less overall activity during 2016 as compared to 2015. Production and ad valorem taxes. The following table provides the components of our production and ad valorem tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Production taxes $ 117 $ 2.13 $ 128 $ 2.46 Ad valorem taxes 14 0.25 23 0.44 Total production and ad valorem taxes $ 131 $ 2.38 $ 151 $ 2.90 Production taxes per unit of production were $2.13 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 13 percent from $2.46 per Boe during 2015. The decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices. Over the same period, our average realized prices per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 14 percent. 60 Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Geological and geophysical $ 8 $ 10 Exploratory dry hole costs 7 9 Leasehold abandonments 50 25 Other 12 15 Total exploration and abandonments $ 77 $ 59 Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to (i) an uneconomic well in our Southern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish production in an unconventional zone for the area and (ii) expensing an unsuccessful well, which we did not operate, that was located in our New Mexico Shelf core area. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $50 million primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas which, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin core areas. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $25 million primarily related to expired and abandoned acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin core area where we currently have no intent to drill. Our other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 1,145 $ 20.79 $ 1,203 $ 23.02 Depreciation of other property and equipment 21 0.37 19 0.35 Amortization of intangible assets 1 0.03 1 0.03 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 1,167 $ 21.19 $ 1,223 $ 23.40 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 39.25 $ 46.79 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 2.48 $ 2.59 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,145 million ($20.79 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $58 million (5 percent) from $1,203 million ($23.02 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition and reductions in future estimated lease operating expenses, partially offset by decreased proved 61 reserves caused by (i) reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (ii) lower commodity prices. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with additional other property and equipment related to buildings and other items. Impairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2016, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2017 price of $56.19 per barrel of oil to a 2024 price of $57.41 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2017 price of $3.61 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2020 price of $2.88 per Mcf of natural gas partially recovering to a 2024 price of $3.38 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2024. We calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2022 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2022. We recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the carrying amount of certain of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets being less than their expected undiscounted future net cash flows, which was primarily attributable to properties in our eastern Midland Basin area. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. If the oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis would have been approximately 10 percent lower as of December 31, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve volumes, no impairment would be indicated. 62 General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 184 $ 3.33 $ 187 $ 3.58 Less: Operating fee reimbursements (17) (0.31) (19) (0.37) Non-cash stock-based compensation 59 1.07 63 1.21 Total general and administrative expenses $ 226 $ 4.09 $ 231 $ 4.42 General and administrative expenses were approximately $226 million ($4.09 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $5 million (2 percent) from $231 million ($4.42 per Boe) for 2015 . The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in forfeiture estimates. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in non-cash stock-based compensation costs noted above coupled with a slight increase in production. We receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of $17 million and $19 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in reimbursements was primarily due to decreased drilling and completion activity during 2016 and a higher average working interest in our wells drilled in 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated in 2016 as compared to 2015. Gain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Gain (loss) on derivatives: Oil derivatives $ (337) $ 675 Natural gas derivatives (32) 25 Total $ (369) $ 700 The following table represents our net cash receipts from derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Net cash receipts from derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 609 $ 597 Natural gas derivatives 16 36 Total $ 625 $ 633 63 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Gain (loss) on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $118 million and a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $54 million, respectively. In February 2016 , we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million. In December 2015 , we completed an acreage exchange with Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. that consolidated acres into a concentrated, operated position in our Southern Delaware Basin core area. We recognized a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $50 million related to the acreage exchange. Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Interest expense $ 204 $ 215 Capitalized interest - 5 Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest $ 204 $ 220 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility - 2.4% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes 5.9% 5.9% Total weighted average interest rate 5.8% 5.8% Weighted average credit facility balance $ - $ 195 Weighted average senior notes balance 3,182 3,350 Total weighted average debt balance $ 3,182 $ 3,545 The decrease in the weighted average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the repayment of our credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from our October 2015 equity offering and, to a lesser extent, the early redemption of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.0% Notes. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance, partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest. Loss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 . This amount includes (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs. Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $876 million and income tax expense of approximately $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The shift in our income tax provision is primarily due to a significant pre-tax book loss in 2016 as compared to pre-tax book income in 2015. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38 percent and 32 percent, respectively. We evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million and approximately $9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. 64 Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions, during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 totaled $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to our increased drilling and completion activity level during 2017 as compared to 2016. Our intent is to manage our capital spending to be within our cash flow, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in costs incurred and cash flow expenditures was our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition and timing of payments. Total 2017 expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC and (iii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition. 2018 capital budget . In February 2018, we announced our 2018 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $2.0 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our 2018 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. Other than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise. Acquisitions. The following table reflects o ur expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Property acquisition costs: Proved $ 303 $ 982 $ 57 Unproved 905 1,154 206 Total property acquisition costs (a) $ 1,208 $ 2,136 $ 263 (a) Included in the property acquisition costs above are budgeted unproved leasehold acreage acquisitions of approximately $52 million, $30 million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our unbudgeted acquisitions are primarily comprised of approximately $1.1 billion of property acquisition costs related to our Midland Basin and Northern Delaware Basin acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our unbudgeted acquisitions are primarily comprised of approximately $2.1 billion of property acquisition costs related to the Reliance Acquisition and Southern Delaware Basin acquisition. 65 Contractual obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 : Payments Due by Period Less than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long-term debt (a) $ 2,722 $ - $ - $ 322 $ 2,400 Cash interest expense on debt (b) 1,797 150 229 222 1,196 Derivative liabilities (c) 379 277 102 - - Asset retirement obligations (d) 141 12 13 3 113 Employment agreements with officers (e) 8 8 - - - Purchase obligations (f) 256 33 84 55 84 Operating lease obligations (g) 31 10 15 5 1 Total contractual obligations $ 5,334 $ 490 $ 443 $ 607 $ 3,794 (a) See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding future interest payment obligations on our long-term debt. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (b) Cash interest expense on our senior notes is estimated assuming no principal repayment until their maturity dates. Also included in the Less than 1 year column is accrued interest at December 31, 2017 of approximately $36 million. During 2017, we decreased our annual interest expense and extended our average maturity from six to 16 years by issuing the 2017 Notes and completing the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes. At December 31, 2017, we had variable-rate debt outstanding under our credit facility of $322 million. (c) Derivative obligations represent commodity derivatives that were valued at December 31, 2017. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our derivative obligations. (d) Amounts represent costs related to expected oil and natural gas property abandonments related to proved reserves by period, net of any future accretion. (e) Represents amounts of cash compensation we are obligated to pay to our officers under employment agreements assuming such employees continue to serve the entire term of their employment agreement and their cash compensation is not adjusted. (f) Relates to purchase agreements we have entered into including daywork drilling contracts, water commitment agreements, throughput volume delivery commitments, power commitments, fixed asset commitments and maintenance commitments. (g) We lease vehicles, equipment and office facilities under non-cancellable operating leases. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 66 Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from (i) operating activities , (ii) borrowings under our credit facility, (iii) proceeds from bond and equity offerings and (iv) asset dispositions. In February 2018, we announced our 2018 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $2.0 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our 2018 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. The following table summarizes our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,695 $ 1,384 $ 1,530 Net cash used in investing activities (1,719) (2,225) (2,602) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (29) 665 1,301 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (53) $ (176) $ 229 Cash flow from operating activities. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $951 million and a decrease in cash interest expense of approximately $55 million, partially offset by (i) approximately $546 million decrease in settlements received from derivatives, (ii) approximately $88 million increase in production expense and (iii) approximately $68 million increase in production tax expense. The decrease in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $169 million and approximately $95 million of negative variances in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by (i) approximately $70 million decrease in production expense, (ii) approximately $20 million decrease in production tax expense, (iii) an increase in operating cash flow of approximately $13 million due to a cash tax benefit of approximately $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to cash tax expense of approximately $1 million during 2015 and (iv) a decrease in cash interest expense of approximately $11 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities included a reduction of approximately $23 million, a reduction of approximately $51 million and a benefit of approximately $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, associated with changes in working capital items. Changes in working capital items adjust for the timing of receipts and payments of actual cash. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we invested approximately $1,581 million, $1,046 million and $2,185 million, respectively, for additions to oil and natural gas properties. Additionally, we completed acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties of approximately $908 million, $1,351 million and $259 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The primary reason for the differences in costs incurred and cash flow expenditures in 2017 was our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition and timing of payments. In 2016, the primary reason for the differences in costs incurred and cash flow expenditures was (i) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition, (ii) our issuance of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock related to our Reliance Acquisition and (iii) timing of payments, while the difference in 2015 was primarily due to timing of payments. The 2017 expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC and (iii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition. The 2016 expenditures were funded in part from (i) proceeds from our February 2016 divestiture, (ii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition, (iii) proceeds from our August 2016 equity offering and (iv) our issuance of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock related to our Reliance Acquisition. The 2015 expenditures were funded in part from borrowings under our credit facility and our equity offerings in 2015. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to (i) an increase in proceeds from the disposition of assets of approximately $471 million from 2016 to 2017, (ii) a decrease of approximately $443 million for acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties from 2016 to 2017 and (iii) contributions to our equity method investments of approximately $56 million during 2016, while no contributions were made in 2017, partially offset by an increase of approximately $535 million for additions to oil and natural gas properties from 2016 to 2017. 67 Cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to (i) proceeds from the disposition of assets of approximately $332 million during 2016, (ii) a decrease of approximately $47 million in amounts invested in oil and natural gas properties from 2015 to 2016, (iii) contributions to our equity method investments of approximately $56 million during 2016 compared to contributions of approximately $91 million during 2015 and (iv) approximately $61 million invested in other property and equipment during 2016 compared to approximately $67 million in 2015, partially offset by a 2016 cash outflow for funds held in escrow of $43 million related to our January 2017 asset acquisition. Cash flow from financing activities. Below is a description of our financing activities. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 we completed the following significant capital markets activities: In September 2017, we issued $1,800 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $1,777 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility, to fund the (i) Tender Offer of $1,232 million principal amount of the 5.5% Notes at a price equal to 102.934 percent of par and (ii) satisfaction and discharge of our remaining obligations of $918 million principal amount under the indentures of the 5.5% Notes at a price equal to 102.75 percent of par. The early extinguishment price included approximately $36 million associated with the premium paid for the Tender Offer, approximately $25 million for the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 5.5% Notes and approximately $2 million for prepaid interest as part of the satisfaction and discharge. In December 2016, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2025 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $592 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the satisfaction and discharge of our obligations under the indenture of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.5% Notes at a price equal to 103.25 percent of par. The early extinguishment price included the make-whole premium of $20 million. In September 2016, we redeemed the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.0% Notes at a price equal to 103.5 percent of par. The redemption price included the make-whole premium for the early redemption of $21 million. In August 2016, we issued approximately 10.4 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $130.90 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price for the Reliance Acquisition and to fund part of the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes and the remainder for general corporate purposes. In October 2015, we issued approximately 8.9 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $92.50 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $794 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and used the remainder for general corporate purposes and for funding of our 2016 acquisitions. In March 2015, we issued 6.9 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $107.49 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $742 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the remainder for general corporate purposes. During 2017, we had net borrowings on our credit facility of $322 million. During 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. In April 2017, we amended our credit facility to decrease our unused lender commitments. In September 2017, we elected to enter into an Investment Grade Period under our credit facility, which had the effect of releasing all collateral formerly securing the credit facility. If the Investment Grade Period under the credit facility terminates (whether automatically or by our election), the credit facility will once again be secured by a first lien on substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and by a pledge of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, we had unused commitments on our credit facility of $1.7 billion . Advances on our credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on: (i) an alternative base rate, which is equal to the highest of (a) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank (4.50 percent at December 31, 2017), (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0 percent; or (ii) LIBOR. The credit facility interest rates and commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment vary depending on our credit ratings from Moody and S&P. At our current credit ratings, LIBOR Rate Loans and Alternate Base Rate Loans bear interest margins of 150 basis points and 50 basis points per annum, respectively, and commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment are 25 basis points per annum. 68 In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. Historically, we have demonstrated our use of the capital markets by issuing common stock and senior unsecured debt. There are no assurances that we can access the capital markets to obtain additional funding, if needed, and at cost and terms that are favorable to us. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in energy companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time to time. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our credit facility. Liquidity. Our principal source of liquidity is available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2017 , our commitments from our bank group were $2.0 billion, of which $1.7 billion was unused commitments. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, our cash position increased by approximately $250 million as a result of completing two divestitures of oil and natural gas properties located in the Southern Delaware Basin core area. During 2017, we decreased our annual interest expense and extended the average maturity on our senior notes from six to 16 years by issuing the 2017 Notes and completing the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes. We also note that the TCJA may have longer-term impacts on our liquidity and financial position, primarily as a result of the federal statutory tax rate changing to 21 percent from 35 percent and repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. Beginning January 1, 2018, our income will be subject to the new 21 percent federal statutory tax rate, which will allow us to retain a greater percentage of earnings and improve our consolidated results of operations. Debt ratings . We receive debt credit ratings from S&P, Moody and Fitch, which are subject to regular reviews. In August 2017, our long-term debt was assigned a first-time investment grade rating by Fitch, and our rating by S&P was raised to an investment grade rating. In determining our ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, the industry in which we operate, production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A downgrade in our credit ratings could (i) negatively impact our costs of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy, (ii) affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt, and (iii) negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Further, if we are unable to maintain credit ratings of Ba2 or better from Moody and BB or better from S&P, the Investment Grade Period will automatically terminate and cause the credit facility to once again be secured by a first lien on substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and by a pledge of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. These and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no changes in our credit ratings have occurred; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. Book capitalization and current ratio . Our net book capitalization at December 31, 2017 was $11.6 billion, consisting of debt of $ 2.7 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 8.9 billion. Our net book capitalization at December 31, 2016 was $10.2 billion, consisting of $ 0.1 b illion of cash and cash equivalents, debt of $ 2.7 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 7.6 billion. Our ratio of net debt to net book capitalization was 23 percent and 26 percent at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.51 to 1.0 at December 31, 2017 as compared to 0.75 to 1.0 at December 31, 2016. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities at December 31, 2016 reflects the reclassification of certain prior period amounts to conform to the 2017 presentation. Both our ratio of net debt to net book capitalization and our ratio of current assets to current liabilities were impacted subsequent to December 31, 2017 by our two January 2018 divestitures. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that we are unable to control or predict. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received an average of $48.13 per barrel of oil and $3.07 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $39.90 and $44.69 per barrel of oil and $2.23 and $2.46 per Mcf of natural gas in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. 69 Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of business combinations, accounting and valuation of nonmonetary transactions, valuation of financial derivative instruments and income taxes. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under this method, exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when a well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing fields are sold. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively impair our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties or projects are periodically assessed for impairment of value by considering future drilling plans, the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of two to 39 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. 70 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Future Cash Flows This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with SEC guidelines. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2017 was based on the 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month WTI posted price of $47.79 per Bbl for oil and Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $2.98 per MMBtu for natural gas. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future net cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this report as of December 31, 2017 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2017 Standardized Measure on the 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing for oil and natural gas and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. Our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase, reducing future earnings. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our proved properties for impairment. Asset Retirement Obligations There are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and, generally, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. When the judgments used to estimate the initial fair value of the asset retirement obligation change, an adjustment is recorded to both the obligation and the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Historically, there have been no significant revisions to our initial estimates once future results became known. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than management estimates of its future net cash flows, including cash flows from proved reserves, risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, and integrated assets. If the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates, cash flows from integrated assets and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions in estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. At December 31, 2017, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2018 price of $59.55 per barrel of oil decreasing to a 2024 price of $51.82 per barrel of oil marginally recovering to a 2025 price of $51.83 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2018 price of $2.84 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2019 price of $2.81 per Mcf then rising to a 2025 price of $2.99 per Mcf of natural gas. Both oil and natural gas commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2025. Unproved oil and natural gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment by considering future drilling and exploration plans, results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales and expiration of all or a portion of the projects. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized expense of approximately 71 $ 29 million, $ 60 million and $ 35 million, respectively, related to abandoned and expiring acreage, which is included in exploration and abandonments expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with GAAP, we calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation using various valuation methods. The valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value. We utilize (i) the average of the high and low stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and (ii) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. The significant assumptions used in these models include expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, forfeiture rate, and the probability of meeting performance targets. Each of these valuation methods were chosen as management believes they give the best estimate of fair value for the respective stock-based awards. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding our stock-based compensation. Valuation of Business Combinations In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must record assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties and integrated assets. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we utilize estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. We make future price assumptions to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To estimate the fair value of unproved properties, we apply risk-weighting factors of the future net cash flows of unproved reserves, or we may evaluate acreage values through recent market transactions in the area. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in a higher depletion expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Historically, we have had no material revisions to valuations of business combinations once actual results became known. Accounting and Valuation of Nonmonetary Transactions In connection with nonmonetary transactions, which include exchanges of producing and non-producing assets, we must evaluate the transaction to determine appropriate accounting treatment. In general, the basic principle of accounting for nonmonetary transactions is based on the fair values involved, which is the same basis used in monetary transactions and results in the recognition of gains and losses. However, certain nonmonetary transactions meet criteria that require modification of the basic principle that necessitate recording values based on historical book value. We determine the treatment of nonmonetary transactions based on the individual facts and circumstances of each transaction. In cases where nonmonetary transactions are recorded at fair value, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions are related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, similar to our valuation of the fair value of oil and natural gas assets acquired during a business combination described above. Any resulting difference between the fair value of the assets involved and their carrying value is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. Estimated fair values assigned to assets exchanged can have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. If future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value, we would record an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Valuation of Financial Derivative Instruments In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. In 72 addition, we have used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price-sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties creditworthiness. All derivative instruments are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value of $379 million at December 31, 2017. In order to determine the fair value at the end of each reporting period, we compute discounted cash flows for the duration of each commodity derivative instrument using the terms of the related contract. Inputs consist of published forward commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate. We compare these prices to the price parameters contained in our hedge contracts to determine estimated future cash inflows or outflows. We then discount the cash inflows or outflows using a combination of published LIBOR rates and Eurodollar futures rates. The fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities include a measure of credit risk based on average published yields by credit rating. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported a $126 million loss on commodity derivative instruments. We compare our estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments with those provided by our counterparties. There have been no significant differences. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the President signed the TCJA into law, which enacted significant changes to the federal income tax laws. According to ASC 740, Income Taxes, a company is required to record the effects of an enacted tax law or rate change in the period of enactment. Based on the comprehensiveness of TCJA and the challenges faced by calendar year-end registrants to complete the accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment, the SEC issued SAB 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allows companies to report provisional amounts when based on reasonable estimates and to adjust these amounts during a measurement period of up to one year. Although we have performed an initial assessment of the TCJA, we recognize it is a comprehensive tax bill and the ultimate impacts may differ from our initial estimates due to changes in our interpretations as a result of additional regulatory guidance that may become available. As such, we have elected to apply SAB 118 and have recorded provisional amounts of our income tax balances in our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to monitor new tax law interpretations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to revised deferred tax amounts. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the TCJA, including the federal statutory tax rate change noted below, in our year-end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the TCJA and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $398 million as a decrease to our income tax provision at December 31, 2017. The provisional amount related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future was $398 million. Our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our overall tax rate using a combination of the enacted federal statutory tax rate, which decreased from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the TCJA, and a blend of enacted state tax rates. Acquisitions or dispositions of assets and changes in our drilling plan by tax jurisdiction could change the apportionment of our state taxes, which would impact our overall tax rate. The TCJA also repealed the corporate AMT for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and provides that existing AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning with the 2018 tax year. We have approximately $10 million of AMT credit carryovers that are expected to be fully refunded by 2022. Our federal and state income tax returns are not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, which are based on numerous judgments and assumptions inherent in the determination of future taxable income, at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes and tax credits. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our income tax returns. Historically, we have had no significant changes as a result of filing our tax returns. Material changes to our tax accruals may occur in the future based on audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for additional information regarding our current year income tax expense and deferred tax balances. 73 New accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. The new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We will use the modified retrospective method to adopt the standard, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard will be recognized with an adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. We have completed our internal evaluation of the adoption of this standard, which included a review of revenue-related contracts with customers and the application of the new revenue recognition model against those contracts and have updated our revenue recognition policy and our related internal control documentation, processes and controls to conform to the new standard . We will also expand our revenue recognition related disclosures. Including those changes previously discussed, this new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes current lease guidance. The new lease standard requires all leases with a term greater than one year to be recognized on the balance sheet while maintaining substantially similar classifications for financing and operating leases. Lease expense recognition on the consolidated statements of operations will be effectively unchanged. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We do not plan to early adopt the standard. We enter into lease agreements to support our operations. These agreements are for leases on assets such as office space, vehicles, field services, well equipment and drilling rigs. We are substantially complete with the process of reviewing and determining the contracts to which this new guidance applies. We are currently enhancing our accounting systems in order to track and calculate additional information necessary for adoption of this standard. We believe this new guidance will have a moderate impact to our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are not currently recognized under currently applicable guidance. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss methodology. This new methodology requires that a financial asset measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This standard is intended to provide more timely decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is allowed as early as fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, with the objective of adding guidance to assist in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as asset acquisitions or as business combinations. The guidance provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the acquired assets is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the set is not a business. If the screen is not met, to be considered a business, the set must include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output. This new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is allowed. We do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 74
