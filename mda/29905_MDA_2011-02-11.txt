Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Dover Corporation for the three years ended December 31, 2010. The following MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS inside the front cover of this Form 10-K. OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK As the global economy strengthened in 2010, the Company experienced increased demand across most of its end-markets as well as higher bookings and backlog in all of its segments. In total, the Company consolidated revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 24%, over 2009 to $7.1 billion, inclusive of acquisitions. Furthermore, the Company successfully leveraged the structural improvements made over the last few years to expand consolidated gross profit margin by 200 basis points to 38.3%, as compared with 2009. The Company generated free cash flow of $767 million, representing 11% of revenue and 108% of earnings from continuing operations, despite significant investments necessary to support the growing businesses. The Company deployed this cash in support of its growth strategies as well as continuing its 55-year record of increasing its annual dividend to shareholders. Developing economies in Asia contributed 17% of 2010 consolidated revenues, and the Company expects to continue its expansion into Asia and other growing markets. Given this strong momentum entering 2011, along with the execution of its strategies around product innovation, global expansion, leveraging its scale and disciplined capital allocation, the Company believes it is well-positioned for solid growth in the future. The Company estimates 2011 full year organic growth to be in the range of 6% to 8% (assuming a negligible impact from foreign currency) and acquisition related growth to be approximately 3% for transactions completed in 2010 and four acquisitions completed in January 2011, the largest being Harbison-Fischer, which closed on January 3, 2011. Based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations, the Company has projected that its diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2011 will be in the range of $4.05 to $4.25 and expects its earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters. 21 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS % / Point Change 2010 2009 Years Ended December 31, versus versus 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In thousands except per share figures) Revenue $ 7,132,648 $ 5,775,689 $ 7,568,888 24 % (24 )% Cost of goods and services 4,399,990 3,676,535 4,838,881 20 % (24 )% Gross profit 2,732,658 2,099,154 2,730,007 30 % (23 )% Selling and administrative expenses 1,697,721 1,511,111 1,700,677 12 % (11 )% Restructuring severance and exit costs 6,200 72,102 27,364 (91 )% 163 % Interest expense, net 106,341 100,375 96,037 6 % 5 % Other expense (income), net 3,512 (3,950 ) (12,726 ) (189 )% (69 )% Earnings from continuing operations 707,908 371,894 694,758 90 % (46 )% Net earnings 700,104 356,438 590,831 96 % (40 )% Net earnings per common share diluted $ 3.70 $ 1.91 $ 3.12 94 % (39 )% Gross profit margin 38.3 % 36.3 % 36.1 % 2.0 0.2 Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 23.8 % 26.2 % 22.5 % (2.4 ) 3.7 Effective tax rate 23.5 % 24.4 % 26.6 % (0.9 ) (2.2 ) Revenue Consolidated revenue in 2010 increased $1.4 billion or 24% reflecting organic revenue growth of 20%, growth from acquisitions of 4%, and a negligible unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The organic growth reflects volume increases across all of the Company segments, driven by higher demand in the majority of the Company end-markets as the global economy continues to rebound. Revenues generated outside of the U.S. increased by 30% compared with 2009, with much of this growth generated in emerging economies of Asia and Latin America. The $1.8 billion or 24% decrease in consolidated revenue in 2009 reflected a 24% decline in organic revenue and a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by 2% net growth from acquisitions. The decline in organic revenue reflected lower demand and sales volumes across all four business segments stemming from general unfavorable global economic conditions. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $633.5 million or 30% in 2010 compared with 2009, reflecting the increased sales volumes. Gross profit margin improved to 38.3% in 2010, a 200 basis point improvement over the 2009 gross profit margin of 36.3%, reflecting the increase in sales volumes in 2010, the impact of lower restructuring charges on a comparative basis, and benefits realized from restructuring initiatives executed in 2009 along with Dover productivity initiatives. Gross profit decreased $630.9 million or 23% in 2009 compared with 2008, consistent with the decline in revenue for the period. Gross margin as a percentage of sales remained essentially flat at 36.3% and 36.1% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $186.6 million or 12% in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of sales, selling and administrative expenses declined to 23.8% in 2010 compared with 26.2% in 2009. This 240 basis point improvement reflects the absence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 and the benefits realized from 2009 restructuring efforts, as well as leverage from the higher revenue levels partially offset by increased compensation costs. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $189.6 million or 11% in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decreased revenue activity, cost curtailment efforts and integration programs, partially offset by restructuring charges. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 26.2% in 2009 from 22.5% in the prior year, reflecting reduced revenue levels and restructuring charges of $50.2 million. Interest Expense, net Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $115.5 million, $116.2 million and $130.2 million, respectively. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9.1 million, $15.8 million $34.2 million, respectively. Interest expense, net, increased 6.0% in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to reduced interest income in 2010 resulting from lower interest rates on the Company short term investment balances. Interest expense, net increased 4.5% in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to reduced interest income stemming from lower interest rates on cash and investments which more than offset the reduction in interest expense due to lower average outstanding commercial paper balances during the 2009 period. Other Expense (Income), net Other expense, net of $3.5 million in 2010 reflects $6.6 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, coupled with a $4.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt, offset in part by royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains. This compares to other income, net of $4.0 million in 2009, which reflects $6.0 million of net expense from foreign currency exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Company functional currency, which was more than offset by a favorable insurance settlement and other miscellaneous non-operating gains. In 2008, other income, net of $12.7 million reflected net gains from foreign currency exchange fluctuations of $6.7 million, coupled with other miscellaneous non-operating gains. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2010 was 23.5% compared to the 2009 rate of 24.4%. The effective tax rate was impacted by discrete items in both years. The effective tax rate for 2010 was favorably impacted by net discrete items totaling $38.5 million, arising principally from third and fourth quarter settlements with U.S. taxing authorities, coupled with the resolution of a foreign tax matter in the third quarter. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by $31.6 million of net benefits recognized for discrete items in the second and fourth quarters of 2009. Excluding these discrete items, the effective tax rate for 2010 was 27.6% compared to 30.8% for 2009, the variance of which is primarily attributed to a more favorable mix of non-U.S. earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions in 2010. With the exception of contested matters, for which an estimate cannot be made due to uncertainties, the Company believes that additional uncertain tax positions will be settled in 2011. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2009 was 24.4% compared to the 2008 rate of 26.6%, reflecting the previously mentioned discrete items in the second and fourth quarters of 2009. The effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by $26.3 million of net benefits recognized for discrete items in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The full year 2009 rate reflects the favorable impact of net benefits for discrete items and the favorable impact of a higher percentage of non-U.S. earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions. Excluding these discrete items, the effective tax rate for 2009 was 30.8% compared to 29.3% for 2008. 23 Table of Contents Net Earnings Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $700.1 million or $3.70 dilutive earnings per share ( EPS ) including a loss from discontinued operations of $7.8 million or $0.04 EPS, compared to net earnings of $356.4 million or $1.91 dilutive EPS for the same period of 2009, including a loss from discontinued operations of $15.5 million or $0.08 EPS. The loss from discontinued operations in 2010 includes a loss of approximately $14.2 million, net of tax, related to the sale of a business that had been previously reflected as a discontinued operation as well as other expense and accrual adjustments relating to other previously discontinued operations. These losses and expenses were offset in part by tax benefits, which included approximately $11.6 million relating to discrete tax items settled or resolved during the third and fourth quarters. The loss from discontinued operations in 2009 includes approximately $10.3 million, net of tax, related to a write-down of a business held for sale. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $356.4 million or $1.91 dilutive EPS including a loss from discontinued operations of $15.5 million or $0.08 EPS, compared to net earnings of $590.8 million or $3.12 dilutive EPS for the same period of 2008, including a loss from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS. As noted above, the loss from discontinued operations in 2009 includes approximately $10.3 million, net of tax, related to a write-down of a business held for sale. The loss from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflects a loss provision for a business held for sale, as well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing federal tax settlements and state tax assessments. In addition to these factors, 2009 earnings across all platforms were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges as noted below, while 2010 earnings reflect the benefits captured from the businesses restructuring and integration programs initiated in 2008 and 2009. Severance and Exit Reserves In late 2008, the Company launched various synergy capture programs and restructuring initiatives in response to the weakening global economic environment. In 2008 and 2009, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $27.4 million and $72.1 million, respectively, relating to these programs. These programs were largely executed throughout 2009, and the Company realized incremental savings of approximately $125 million and $32 million in 2009 and 2010, respectively. During 2009, the Company had a net reduction in its workforce of approximately 2,950, or 9%, and a net reduction of 23 manufacturing and warehouse facilities, as a result of these strategic restructuring efforts. By 2010, the Company completed the majority of the initiatives launched in 2008 and 2009 and initiated a few targeted facility consolidations at its operating companies, resulting in restructuring charges of $6.2 million, a significant decline compared to the previous two years. The remaining exit reserves of $6.8 million at December 31, 2010 relate primarily to lease commitment obligations in connection with the prior years restructuring activities. The Company does not expect to undertake significant restructuring activities in 2011, but will continue to monitor business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity as necessary depending on the economic climate. 24 Table of Contents A summary of the Company restructuring activity for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in thousands): Severance Exit Total Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 5,762 $ 22,668 $ 28,430 Provision 14,980 12,384 27,364 Purchase accounting 2,933 2,698 5,631 Payments (16,094 ) (12,035 ) (28,129 ) Other, including impairments (378 ) (1,961 ) (2,339 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 7,203 23,754 30,957 Provision 53,106 18,996 72,102 Purchase accounting (16,074 ) (16,074 ) Payments (53,009 ) (13,828 ) (66,837 ) Other, including impairments 852 (4,229 ) (3,377 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 8,152 8,619 16,771 Provision 2,989 3,211 6,200 Payments (9,773 ) (5,574 ) (15,347 ) Other, including impairments (225 ) 495 270 At December 31, 2010 $ 1,143 $ 6,751 $ 7,894 Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company had established reserves related to severance and facility closings in connection with certain acquisitions, which were established through the purchase accounting for these acquisitions, as allowed under accounting guidance in effect at the time. The restructuring reserve balances at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 include $0.9 million, $27.9 million and $26.8 million for acquisition-related restructuring accruals that were established in purchase accounting. These reserves were substantially settled in 2010. A summary of restructuring charges by segment and income statement classification for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Industrial Products $ 1,182 $ 17,505 $ 8,285 Engineered Systems 2,364 18,381 10,071 Fluid Management 1,476 9,707 2,475 Electronic Technologies 1,178 26,509 6,533 Total $ 6,200 $ 72,102 $ 27,364 Classified in the Statements of Operations as follows: Cost of goods and services $ 2,147 $ 21,943 $ Selling and adminstrative expenses 4,053 50,159 27,364 Total $ 6,200 $ 72,102 $ 27,364 25 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenue, earnings and operating margin to the Company consolidated revenue, earnings from continuing operations, and operating margin.

The revenue increase was predominantly attributed to organic revenue growth, with nominal 2010 revenue growth from the acquisition of Gear Products in the third quarter by Tulsa Winch in the segment Material Handling platform. Earnings and margin were favorably impacted by increased volume in high margin businesses, the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits associated with prior year restructuring initiatives. Material Handling 2010 revenue increased 29% while earnings increased over 200% when compared with the prior year. Revenue improvements were experienced across the platform, including modest improvements in those businesses with commercial construction exposure, driven by increased activity across most end-markets. Improvements in the energy and infrastructure end-markets, along with modest automotive market recovery, particularly outside the U.S., contributed to backlog levels at the end of 2010 which were 42% higher than 2009 year-end levels. Earnings and operating margin improved due to the increased sales volume, coupled with the absence of restructuring charges in the current period and the benefits associated with prior year restructuring initiatives. 26 Table of Contents Mobile Equipment 2010 revenue and earnings each increased 3% as compared with the prior year. The revenue growth was generated primarily by the vehicle service business, offset in part by softness in bulk trailer and refuse vehicle markets. Earnings and operating margin at the platform level were favorably impacted by the absence of significant restructuring charges in the current period coupled with the benefits achieved from restructuring initiatives taken in the prior year; however, this was substantially offset by the impact of unfavorable product mix in the period. 2009 Versus 2008 Industrial Products 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 34% and 53%, respectively, compared with 2008, primarily due to general economic conditions as well as the continued downturn in infrastructure, energy, and transportation markets. The segment decline in revenue primarily reflected a core business decrease of 33% and an unfavorable impact of 1% due to foreign exchange. Earnings and margin were impacted by decreased revenue and $17.5 million in restructuring charges. The segment experienced modest improvement in commercial activity across markets served during the fourth quarter of 2009. Material Handling revenue and earnings decreased 42% and 73%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The platform experienced significant challenges in its core infrastructure, automotive, construction equipment and energy markets, which were partially offset by an increase in military demand. The decrease in revenue coupled with restructuring charges of $11.0 million negatively impacted earnings. Although bookings were down 47% as compared to 2008, the platform served end-markets stabilized in the fourth quarter. Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings decreased 27% and 29%, respectively, over the prior year. The strength of the military market during the year was offset by challenges in the energy, bulk transport and vehicle service markets. Earnings at the platform were primarily impacted by lower revenue and restructuring charges of $6.5 million.

The improvement in revenue was the result of a 12% increase in organic business revenue and an 8% increase from acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2009. The revenue and earnings increases were substantially driven by strength in Hill Phoenix, Direct Coding and Belvac volumes, including acquisitions, coupled with the benefits from prior year restructuring activities, which more than offset higher commodity costs and unfavorable mix. Engineered Products 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 26% and 30%, respectively, compared with 2009. Organic business revenue increased approximately 13% driven by higher sales volume at Hill Phoenix and Belvac, while growth from acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2009 contributed 13% to revenue growth and was accretive to 2010 earnings. The platform earnings were favorably impacted by the higher sales volumes and contribution from prior year restructuring activities, partly offset by higher material costs and unfavorable product and customer mix. Product Identification 2010 revenue and earnings increased 11% and 31%, respectively, compared with 2009, with growth driven by organic sales volume growth and benefit from the 2009 acquisition of Extech Instruments. The platform earnings reflect continued investment in research and development, the favorable impact of product and geographic mix, the absence of restructuring charges and the benefits of prior year restructuring initiatives. 2009 Versus 2008 Engineered Systems 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 7% and 18%, respectively, compared with 2008. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by an 11% decline in core business revenue (excluding acquisitions) as a result of general softness in the markets served by the segment and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3%. The acquisitions of Tyler, Ala Cart, Inc. and Barker Company in the Engineered Products platform and Extech Instruments in the Product Identification platform accounted for 7% revenue growth. The earnings decline was substantially driven by softness in most end markets served, $18.4 million of restructuring charges and $6.2 million of acquisition related expenses. Engineered Products 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 2% and 10%, respectively, compared with 2008. Lower sales volume throughout our core businesses (most notably refrigeration equipment) were partially offset by acquisition revenue. The earnings decline resulted from lower sales volume in commercial cooling, HVAC and packaging equipment, restructuring charges of $6.9 million and $6.2 million of acquisition related expenses. Product Identification 2009 revenue and earnings declined 13% and 18%, respectively, compared with 2008. Core revenue decreased 10% due to lower sales volume in the Direct Marketing and Bar Coding business with the balance of the revenue decline due to foreign exchange. The platform incurred $11.5 million in restructuring charges during the year. 28 Table of Contents Fluid Management % Change 2010 2009 Years Ended December 31, versus versus 2010 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenue Energy $ 885,582 $ 624,211 $ 935,414 42 % (33 )% Fluid Solutions 754,650 646,849 778,812 17 % (17 )% Eliminations (442 ) (150 ) (180 ) $ 1,639,790 $ 1,270,910 $ 1,714,046 29 % (26 )% Segment earnings $ 388,420 $ 259,269 $ 385,317 50 % (33 )% Operating margin 23.7 % 20.4 % 22.5 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 22,010 $ 18,389 $ 19,550 20 % (6 )% Bookings Energy $ 895,360 $ 610,045 $ 964,517 47 % (37 )% Fluid Solutions 758,002 645,098 771,359 18 % (16 )% Eliminations (1,175 ) (140 ) (178 ) $ 1,652,187 $ 1,255,003 $ 1,735,698 32 % (28 )% Backlog Energy $ 94,113 $ 77,173 $ 95,532 22 % (19 )% Fluid Solutions 65,525 60,540 64,471 8 % (6 )% Eliminations (33 ) (2 ) (12 ) $ 159,605 $ 137,711 $ 159,991 16 % (14 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. 2010 Versus 2009 Fluid Management 2010 revenue and earnings increased by 29% and 50%, respectively, compared with 2009. The improvement in revenue was driven by a 25% increase in core business revenue and a 4% increase from acquisitions completed in 2009 and 2010, along with a nominal impact from favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to continued recovery in the oil and gas markets served by the Energy platform as well as in the industrial markets served by the Fluid Solutions platform, along with market share gains at select operating companies. Segment earnings and operating margin reflect the benefit of higher sales volumes, productivity improvements and favorable product mix. The Energy platform 2010 revenue and earnings increased 42% and 63%, respectively, compared with 2009. Organic revenue growth of 34% was driven by higher demand and market share gains in the oil and gas sector, which experienced a significant increase in active North American drilling rigs. The 2009 Inpro/Seal acquisition contributed revenue growth of approximately 7%, and foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenue by 1%. The increase in earnings is the result of higher sales volume and benefits from productivity improvements and 2009 restructuring initiatives. The Fluid Solutions platform revenue and earnings increased 17% and 31%, respectively, compared with 2009 due to higher demand in substantially all end-markets, including chemical, sanitary, transportation, retail fueling and life sciences. Earnings were favorably impacted by the increased volumes and productivity improvements. 29 Table of Contents 2009 Versus 2008 Fluid Management 2009 revenue and earnings decreased by 26% and 33%, respectively, compared with 2008. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a 25% decline in core business revenue and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. The decline in revenue was partially offset by growth of 1% from the full year effect of 2008 acquisitions and a 2009 acquisition. The earnings decline was driven by reduced revenue, $9.7 million in restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses of $2.5 million. The Energy platform 2009 revenue and earnings decreased 33% and 38%, respectively, compared with 2008. The decline in revenue was a result of lower demand in the oil, gas and power generation industries, partially offset by the impact of 2008 and 2009 acquisitions. The platform experienced a recent increase in revenue growth stemming from increases in active North American drilling rigs. The decrease in earnings was a result of lower sales volume, restructuring charges of $3.0 million and acquisition related expenses of $2.5 million, partially offset by operational improvements and cost savings as a result of restructuring activities. Waukesha Bearings acquired Inpro/Seal Company on December 30, 2009, which accounted for the majority of the acquisition costs. The Fluid Solutions 2009 platform revenue and earnings decreased 17% and 20%, respectively, compared with 2008 due to lower demand in its various industrial markets served. Decreased earnings reflected lower sales volume and $6.7 million of restructuring charges.

The increase in revenues was supported by organic revenue growth of 39% and growth from acquisitions of 1%, offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong demand for electronic assembly equipment, Micro Electronic Mechanical Systems ( MEMS ) microphones, hearing aid components and telecom infrastructure related products. Demand also continues to grow for the segment emerging solar products. Revenue from the electronic assembly equipment companies increased 77%, while revenue of the communication component companies increased 20% compared with 2009. Earnings and operating margin in 2010 were favorably impacted by higher sales volume and production leverage, coupled with the absence of significant restructuring charges in the current year and the benefit of prior year restructuring programs. 2009 Versus 2008 Electronic Technologies 2009 revenue and earnings decreased 26% and 57%, respectively, compared with 2008 primarily driven by weak demand for telecom components and electronic assembly and test equipment. The decline in core revenue was 24% and there was a 2% unfavorable impact on revenue from foreign exchange. MEMS products continued to show increased customer adoption, while military and space programs continued to provide a 30 Table of Contents constructive business climate for the segment electronic component companies. Earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by lower sales volume and $26.6 million of restructuring charges. In addition, the comparability of 2009 earnings was impacted by the favorable impact of 2008 earnings, which included a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a business (semi-conductor test handling). FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Debt to Net Capitalization The Company utilizes the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: At December 31, Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Current maturities of long-term debt $ 1,925 $ 35,624 $ 32,194 Commercial paper 15,000 192,750 Long-term debt 1,790,886 1,825,260 1,860,729 Total debt 1,807,811 1,860,884 2,085,673 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (1,309,095 ) (938,174 ) (826,869 ) Net debt 498,716 922,710 1,258,804 Add: Stockholders equity 4,526,562 4,083,608 3,792,866 Net capitalization $ 5,025,278 $ 5,006,318 $ 5,051,670 Net debt to net capitalization 9.9 % 18.4 % 24.9 % The Company net debt to net capitalization levels improved during 2010, primarily as a result of cash generated from operations and lower levels of acquisition investments. In addition, long-term debt decreased due to scheduled repayments, coupled with the early extinguishment of a structured non-interest bearing loan in the third quarter. At December 31, 2010, the Company cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion, representing an increase of $371 million, as compared with the 2009 balance. Cash and equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturities of three months or less. The Company regularly invests cash in excess of near-term requirements in short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase greater than three months, up to twelve months. At December 31, 2010, the Company total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments included $1.2 billion held outside of the United States, and the Company intends to use a significant portion of this to fund the Sound Solutions acquisition, as described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Free Cash Flow In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (as analyzed in the sections below), the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase the Company common stock. For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. 31 Table of Contents The following table reconciles free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities: Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 950,551 $ 802,060 $ 1,010,416 Less: Capital expenditures (183,217 ) (120,009 ) (175,795 ) Free cash flow $ 767,334 $ 682,051 $ 834,621 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 10.8 % 11.8 % 11.0 % Free cash flow in 2010 was $767.3 million or 10.8% of revenue, compared to $682.1 million or 11.8% of revenue in 2009 and $834.6 million or 11.0% of revenue in 2008. The 2010 increase in free cash flow compared to 2009 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations offset by investment in working capital and an increase in capital expenditures as compared to the prior year. The 100 basis point decline in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was the result of the significant reduction in working capital realized in 2009 coupled with lower revenue levels. The 2009 decrease in free cash flow compared to 2008 reflected lower earnings from continuing operations and higher employee benefit contributions partially offset by improvements in working capital and a decrease in capital expenditures. The increase in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was due to active management of adjusted working capital in a lower revenue environment. The Company uses commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of its common stock. The Company currently maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to $1 billion, which expires on November 9, 2012. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for the Company commercial paper program. The Company has not drawn down any loans under this facility nor does it anticipate doing so. If the Company were to draw down a loan, at the Company election, the loan would bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.13% to 0.35% (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded the Company senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody s) or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility. Under this facility, the Company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The Company was in compliance with this covenant and its other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2010 and had a coverage ratio of 12.1 to 1. The Company is not aware of any potential impairment to its liquidity and expects to remain in compliance with all of its debt covenants. The Company also has a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, with remaining capacity of $600 million, that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The Company has a $400 million face value note issuance coming due on February 15, 2011. This amount is classified as long-term within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010, as the Company has the ability and intends to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. At December 31, 2010, the Company also had an outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million, which matures on February 15, 2011. This transaction hedges a portion of the Company net investment in non-U.S. operations. The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income, with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings. The fair values at December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflected losses of $19.8 million and $13.3 million, respectively, due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement. Prior to this hedge maturing, the Company intends to assess market conditions and make a decision as to whether to settle the liability with available sources of liquidity or renew the hedge arrangement. The Company ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of its existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as its current credit standing. The Company 32 Table of Contents credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were as follows as of December 31, 2010: Short Term Long Term Rating Rating Outlook Moody P-1 A2 Stable Standard & Poor A-1 A Stable Fitch F1 A Stable The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase the Company debt. However, management anticipates that the net debt to net capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with the historical range of 25%-30%. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Company various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Management also assesses the Company liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash Flow Summary The following table is derived from the Company Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 950,551 $ 802,060 $ 1,010,416 Investing activities (178,957 ) (257,865 ) (452,994 ) Financing activities (304,788 ) (389,953 ) (560,904 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 increased $148.5 million from 2009. Higher sales volume increased 2010 net earnings before depreciation and amortization by $354 million as compared with 2009. This was offset by a $223 million increase in working capital necessary to support the increase in 2010 order and revenue levels, compared to a $229 million decrease in working capital in the 2009 period when sales levels had declined. Other factors contributing to the 2010 increase in operating cash flows included $52 million less in restructuring payments, $21 million less of post-retirement plan contributions, and a $40 million increase in unearned/deferred revenue due to additional sales activity in the 2010 period. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased $208.4 million from 2008, primarily reflecting lower earnings on reduced sales from continuing operations and increased contributions to employee benefit plans, partially offset by improvements in working capital. Postretirement costs relating to pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans affect results in all segments. The Company recorded net periodic benefit cost of $33 million, $37 million and $36 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to its benefit plans (including its defined benefit, supplemental and post-retirement plans). As further described in Note 13, the main drivers of the expense variance from year to year are the expected returns on plan assets, the service cost and the interest cost. In 2010, the actual return on plan assets increased, consistent with increased returns within the global equity markets. In 2011, the Company expects its net 33 Table of Contents periodic benefit cost to be approximately $36 million, with the increase compared to 2010 being attributed to higher amortization relating to unrecognized losses. The funded status of the Company qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates. The Company contributes cash to its plans at its discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. Cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $38 million, $51 million and $35 million, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company post-retirement plans. At December 31, 2010, the Company qualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by $49 million, which includes $7 million relating to the U.S. Dover Corporate Pension Plan and $42 million relating to the Company significant international pension plans, some in locations where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund the plans due to local regulations. The majority of the international obligations relate to defined pension plans operated by the Company businesses in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. In 2011, the Company expects to contribute approximately $40 million to its qualified defined benefit plans. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2010 decreased $78.9 million compared to 2009, largely due to lower spending on acquisitions in 2010, offset in part by higher net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments and higher capital investments. Cash used in investing activities during 2009 decreased $195.1 million compared to 2008, largely reflecting reduced capital expenditures and higher net proceeds from the sale of short-term investments, partially offset by higher acquisition investments and reduced proceeds from the sale of businesses. Cash consideration paid for acquisitions was $104 million in 2010 compared to $222 million in 2009 and $104 million in 2008. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Sound Solutions business of NXP Semiconductors. Sound Solutions, which is currently headquartered in Vienna, Austria, is one of the world leading manufacturers of dynamic speakers and receivers for the global cell phone market and will become part of Knowles Electronics, which is an operating unit of Dover Electronic Technologies segment. The purchase price is $855 million, subject to customary regulatory approvals, and the deal is expected to close around the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2011. This acquisition is expected to be entirely funded by cash and equivalents currently held outside the U.S. Effective January 3, 2011, the Company also completed the acquisition of Harbison-Fischer, Inc., a Texas-based leading designer and manufacturer of down-hole rod pumps and related products for $402.5 million, subject to normal closing adjustments. Harbison-Fischer 2011 revenue is expected to be approximately $160 million. The business will become part of Norris Production Solutions, which is an operating unit of Dover Fluid Management segment. The Company currently anticipates that these and any other acquisitions made during 2011 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds, and if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper or through public debt markets. Cash used for capital expenditures increased to $183 million in 2010, compared to $120 million in 2009 and $176 million in 2008, with the increase driven by capacity expansion requirements of the Company high-growth businesses. Additionally, 2009 capital spending was at reduced levels due to management spending discretion in response to the weakened economic environment. Capital expenditures during 2011 are expected to be approximately 3.0% to 3.2% of revenue, which compares to 2010 capital expenditures as a percent of revenue of 2.6%. The increase continues to be driven by capacity expansion in high-growth areas, including significant investment to support increased demand in the energy and cell phone markets. 34 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during 2010 decreased $85.2 million compared to 2009, due mainly to lower debt repayments in 2010 and cash inflows from exercise of stock options, offset by share repurchases made in 2010. In 2010, the Company net repayments of debt and commercial paper were $166 million lower than in 2009. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options increased by $53 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the increased exercise of stock options. Cash used in financing activities during 2009 decreased $171.0 million compared to 2008 primarily driven by the absence of share repurchases versus the prior year and reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by debt repayments and higher dividend payments in 2009. During 2010, financing cash outflows included repurchase of approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock in the open market for approximately $124 million, pursuant to the 10,000,000 share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in May 2007. The Company had no share repurchases in 2009. Approximately 6.6 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this 10,000,000 five year authorization as of December 31, 2010. In 2008, pursuant to a separate $500 million share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 10,000,000 shares of its common stock in the open market for $467 million. The Company has completed the purchase of all shares under this $500 million share repurchase program. In 2010, the Company paid quarterly dividends totaling $1.07 per share for the year, for a total of $200 million and a 5% increase over 2009 payments. In 2009 and 2008, $190 million and $169 million, respectively, was paid to shareholders. Adjusted Working Capital In 2010, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from 2009 by $240 million, or 22%, to $1.3 billion, which reflected an increase in receivables of $209 million, an increase in net inventory of $143 million and an increase in accounts payable of $112 million, generally due to additional working capital investment necessary to support the increased revenue levels. Excluding acquisitions, dispositions, and the effects of foreign exchange translation of $14 million, Adjusted Working Capital would have increased by $226 million, or 21%. Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) decreased to 17.6% at December 31, 2010 from 19.9% at December 31, 2009, and inventory turns were 6.7 at December 31, 2010 compared to 6.2 at December 31, 2009. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $66.0 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in 2011 through 2015. These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of its obligations, the probability of which is remote in management opinion. The Company has also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The Company does not have liabilities recorded for certain of the historic indemnifications and is not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities. 35 Table of Contents A summary of the Company consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than More than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Other(4) (In thousands) Long-term debt(1) 1,792,811 $ 401,911 $ 1,116 $ 299,047 $ 1,090,737 $ Interest expense(2) 1,293,735 82,875 159,250 157,422 894,188 Rental commitments 237,358 54,544 76,730 43,048 63,036 Purchase obligations 30,543 27,899 2,597 47 Capital leases 3,467 1,149 1,494 184 640 Supplemental & post-retirement benefits(3) 116,008 18,706 22,562 31,828 42,912 Uncertain tax positions(4) 226,088 29,641 196,447 Total obligations $ 3,700,010 $ 616,725 $ 263,749 $ 531,576 $ 2,091,513 $ 196,447 (1) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts represent total long-term debt, including current maturities. The amount presented within the less than one year category includes $399,986 relating to the Company 6.50% notes which mature February 15, 2011. This amount is classified as long-term within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010 as the Company has the ability and intends to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. The Company anticipates refinancing this debt with a maturity date beyond five years; however, since the terms of the refinancing have not been finalized, the debt is reflected within the less than one year category in the above table. (2) Amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long-term debt using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2010. (3) Amounts represent estimated benefit payments under the Company supplemental and post-retirement benefit plans. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also expects to contribute approximately $40 million to its qualified defined benefit plans in 2011, which amount is not reflected in the above table. (4) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, management is unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2011. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the Company, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1. The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that management considers most critical to an understanding of the Company financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non-essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the 36 Table of Contents Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, then revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the Company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed. Revenues associated with construction-type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method. The Company recognizes contract revenue under percentage-of-completion accounting using the cost to cost method measure of progress. The application of percentage of completion accounting requires estimates of future revenues and contract costs over the full term of the contract. The Company updates project cost estimates on a quarterly basis or more frequently when changes in circumstances warrant. Inventory for the majority of the Company subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though the Company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. The Company has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. The Company assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or, when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, during the interim periods. The Company estimates fair value using discounted cash flow analyses (i.e. an income approach) which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability. Changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. No goodwill impairment was indicated by the Company testing of its 10 identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying values. If the fair value of each of the reporting units was decreased by 10%, the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized. The valuation of the Company pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in the Company pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for the Company future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on the Company pension expenses and related funding requirements. The Company expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. The Company discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year 37 Table of Contents spot rates. As disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company 2010 weighted-average discount rates used to measure its qualified defined benefit, supplemental and other post-retirement obligations were 5.37%, 5.50% and 5.10%, respectively, in each case reduced from the 2009 rates of 5.71%, 5.95% and 5.50%, respectively. The reduced discount rates are reflective of the decline in global market interests over these periods. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately $26.7 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2010. The Company pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have increased the Company defined benefit pension expense by approximately $1.3 million. The Company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the Company future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its provision for income taxes. The Company has significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, the Company experience and relevant industry data. The Company reviews these factors quarterly and considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. The Company has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates is required to quantify the Company ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to ensure that the Company is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While the Company believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar-type entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. The Company is required to recognize in its consolidated statements of operations the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance share awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of its SARs, and stock options that are granted to employees. The model requires management to estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of the Company stock using historical data. The Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also requires management 38 Table of Contents to estimate the volatility of its stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of its peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. New Accounting Standards In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2010-06 which is intended to improve disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance requires entities to disclose significant transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels, the reasons for the transfers and to present information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements separately in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Additionally, the guidance clarifies that a reporting entity should provide fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclose the inputs and valuation techniques used for fair value measurements using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company has applied the new disclosure requirements as of January 1, 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation, which will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13 which amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist, and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables. The guidance is expected to result in more multiple-deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements. Its adoption is not expected to significantly impact the Company consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-14 which eliminates tangible products containing both software and non-software components that operate together to deliver a product functionality from the scope of current generally accepted accounting principles for software. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements. Its adoption is not expected to significantly impact the Company consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, total debt, total capitalization, adjusted working capital, average annual adjusted working capital, revenues excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to net capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase the Company common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational changes, given the global nature of Dover businesses. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company revenue performance and trends between periods. 39 Table of Contents
