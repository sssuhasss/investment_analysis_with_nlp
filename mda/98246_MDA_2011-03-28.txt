Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years that end on January 31 of the following calendar year. Effective with the first quarter of 2010, management changed the Company segment reporting in order to align with a change in its organizational and management reporting structure. Specifically, the Company is now reporting results in Japan separately from the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, and results for certain emerging market countries that were previously included in the Europe and Asia-Pacific segments are now included in the Other non-reportable segment. Prior year results have been revised to reflect this change. KEY STRATEGIES The Company key strategies are: To selectively expand its global distribution without compromising the value of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the Brand ). Management employs a multi-channel distribution strategy. Management intends to expand distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets, and by launching e-commerce websites in new markets. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet the requirements of the Brand. To enhance customer awareness. The Brand is the single most important asset of the Company. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to increase new and existing customer awareness of the Brand and its message, and will continue to monitor the strength of the Brand through market research. To increase store productivity. Over the years, the Company has opened smaller size stores (especially in the United States) which have contributed to higher store productivity. In addition, the Company is committed to growing sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and the conversion rate (the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase) through targeted advertising, ongoing sales training and customer-focused initiatives. To achieve improved operating margins. Management long-term objective is to improve gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) through greater efficiencies in product sourcing, manufacturing and distribution. Management also intends to improve the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales by controlling expenses and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. TIFFANY & CO. K - 25 Table of Contents To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new design collections and expand existing lines. To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and/or polish rough diamonds for use in Company merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To provide superior customer service. Maintaining the strength of the Brand requires that the Company make superior customer service a top priority, which it achieves by employing highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and enhancing ongoing training programs. 2010 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 14% to $3,085,290,000, due to growth in all reportable segments. On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures below), worldwide net sales increased 12% and comparable store sales increased 8%. The Company added a net of 13 TIFFANY & CO. stores (five in the Americas, seven in Asia-Pacific, two in Europe and a net reduction of one in Japan). The Company launched e-commerce websites in eight European countries. Operating margin increased 3.0 percentage points due to a higher gross margin and the leverage effect of increased sales compared with the growth in selling, general and administrative expenses. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 39% to $368,403,000, or $2.87 per diluted share. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 and 2009 are not comparable due to several nonrecurring items recorded in those periods (see Item 6. Selected Financial Data Notes to Selected Financial Data for a listing of those items). Excluding those nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings from continuing operations would have increased 47% to $376,075,000, or $2.93 per diluted share from $255,220,000, or $2.04 per diluted share, in 2009. The Company issued, at par, 10,000,000,000 ($118,430,000 at issuance) of 1.72% Senior Notes due September 2016. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of 15,000,000,000 ($178,845,000 upon payment) of debt that came due in September. The Company also repaid $40,000,000 of debt that came due in December. The Board of Directors approved two increases, totaling 47%, in the dividend on the Company Common Stock increasing the annual dividend rate to $1.00 per share. TIFFANY & CO. K - 26 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internally, management monitors its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous years: 2010 2009 Constant- Constant- GAAP Translation Exchange- GAAP Translation Exchange- Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 14 % 2 % 12 % (5 )% % (5 )% Americas 12 1 11 (11 ) (11 ) Asia-Pacific 29 6 23 17 (2 ) 19 Japan 7 8 (1 ) (4 ) 7 (11 ) Europe 18 (5 ) 23 12 (7 ) 19 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide 10 % 2 % 8 % (7 )% 1 % (8 )% Americas 9 1 8 (14 ) (14 ) Asia-Pacific 19 5 14 8 8 Japan 4 8 (4 ) (4 ) 7 (11 ) Europe 13 (5 ) 18 3 (6 ) 9 TIFFANY & CO.

Reference will be made to comparable store sales below. Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores and boutiques. A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan, sales for a new store or boutique are not included if the store or boutique was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. Americas . Americas includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores in the United States, Canada and Latin/South America, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain of those markets through business-to-business, Internet, catalog and wholesale operations. Americas represented 51%, 52% and 56% of worldwide net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, of which the New York Flagship store represented 8%, 9% and 10% of worldwide net sales. In 2010, total sales in the Americas increased $163,726,000, or 12%, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales increased $102,802,000, or 9%, consisting of increases in both comparable branch store sales of 9% and New York Flagship store sales of 6%. Non-comparable store sales grew $32,800,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in the Americas increased 11%, and comparable store sales increased 8%. Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas increased $14,142,000, or 8%, due to an increase in the average sales per order. In 2009, total sales in the Americas decreased $175,791,000, or 11%, primarily due to a decline in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales decreased $192,484,000, or 14%, consisting of decreases of 15% in New York Flagship store sales and 14% in comparable branch store sales. Non-comparable store sales grew $32,204,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in the Americas decreased 11% and comparable store sales decreased 14%. Combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas decreased $711,000. Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through Internet and wholesale operations. Asia-Pacific represented 18%, 16% and 13% of worldwide net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2010, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $122,901,000, or 29%, primarily due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This increase included a comparable store sales increase of TIFFANY & CO. K - 28 Table of Contents $77,353,000, or 19%, and non-comparable store sales growth of $40,722,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 23% and comparable store sales increased 14% due to geographically broad-based sales growth in most markets, especially in the Greater China region. In 2009, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $63,201,000, or 17%, due to an increase in the number of units sold. This increase included non-comparable store sales growth of $33,800,000, and a comparable store sales increase of $26,262,000, or 8%. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales in 2009 increased 19% and comparable store sales increased 8% due to increases in most markets. Japan. Japan includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. Japan represented 18% of worldwide net sales in 2010, and 19% in both 2009 and 2008. In 2010, total sales in Japan increased $33,548,000, or 7%, due to an increase in the average price per unit sold which was partly offset by a decline in the number of units sold. Comparable store sales increased $17,913,000, or 4%, and other non-retail store sales increased $11,599,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Japan sales decreased 1%, and comparable store sales decreased 4%.

Europe includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through Internet and wholesale operations. Europe represented 12%, 11% and 10% of worldwide net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008. The United Kingdom ( U.K. ) represents approximately half of European sales. In 2010, total sales in Europe increased $54,510,000, or 18%, primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold. This included increased comparable store sales of $34,581,000, or 13%, and non-comparable store sales growth of $19,779,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales increased 23% and comparable store sales increased 18% due to geographically broad-based sales growth. In 2009, total sales in Europe increased $33,228,000, or 12%, due to an increase in the number of units sold. This included non-comparable store sales growth of $28,029,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 19% and comparable store sales rose 9%, reflecting growth in all countries. Store Data . In 2010, the Company added a net of 13 stores: five in the Americas (all in the U.S.), seven in Asia-Pacific (four in China and one each in Korea, Singapore and Taiwan), two in Europe (Spain and the U.K.) and a net reduction of one in Japan. In 2009, the Company added a net of 14 stores: five in the Americas (three in the U.S. and one each in Canada and Mexico), six in Asia-Pacific (two in both China and Korea and one each in Hong Kong and Australia) and three in Europe (two in the U.K. and one in the Netherlands). Additionally, the Company opened two locations and closed two locations in Japan. Sales per gross square foot generated by all stores were approximately $2,600 in 2010, $2,400 in 2009 and $2,600 in 2008. TIFFANY & CO. K - 29 Table of Contents Other. Other consists of all non-reportable segments. Other consists primarily of wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors for resale in certain emerging markets (such as the Middle East and Russia) and wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases that were subsequently deemed not suitable for the Company needs. In addition, Other includes earnings received from third-party licensing agreements. In 2010, Other sales increased $901,000, or 2%, as increased wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales of diamonds. In 2009, Other sales declined $39,308,000, or 42%, due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and decreased wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors. Gross Margin 2010 2009 2008 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 59.1 % 56.5 % 57.8 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased by 2.6 percentage points in 2010 driven primarily by the recapture of higher product costs through retail price increases, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. The 1.3 percentage point decrease in 2009 was primarily due to higher product costs. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate, as it did by increasing prices in 2010, to address specific market conditions, product cost increases and longer-term changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Among the market conditions that the Company addresses is consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence and competitive pricing conditions. The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note J. Hedging Instruments ). Restructuring Charges Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, management implemented various cost reduction initiatives, one of which was a reduction of approximately 10% of the Company total employee base, made primarily in the U.S., to more closely align staffing with anticipated sales levels at the time the decision was made. Accordingly, in 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $97,839,000. This charge included $63,005,000 related to pension and postretirement medical benefits, $33,166,000 related to severance costs and $1,668,000 primarily related to stock-based compensation (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note D. Restructuring Charges ). Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses 2010 2009 2008 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 39.8 % 40.2 % 40.5 % SG&A expenses increased $137,770,000, or 13%, in 2010 and declined $64,217,000, or 6%, in 2009. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to several nonrecurring charges recorded in those periods. TIFFANY & CO. K - 30 Table of Contents SG&A expenses in 2010 included $16,625,000 of expense associated with Tiffany and Company ( Tiffany ) plan to consolidate its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ). SG&A expenses in 2009 included $442,000 of income from the following nonrecurring items: $4,442,000 of income received in connection with the assignment of the Tahera Diamond Corporation ( Tahera ) commitments and liens to an unrelated third party (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ); and $4,000,000 charge to terminate a third-party management agreement (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). SG&A expenses in 2008 included $14,444,000 of expense from the following nonrecurring items: $11,062,000 impairment charge on the investment in Target Resources plc ( Target ) (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ); and $3,382,000 charge for the closing of a diamond polishing facility in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses in 2010, 2009 and 2008 would have been $1,210,872,000, $1,090,169,000 and $1,139,500,000. The increase of $120,703,000, or 11%, in 2010 was largely due to increased marketing expenses of $37,706,000, increased labor and benefits costs of $30,323,000 and increased depreciation and store occupancy expenses of $28,704,000 due to new and existing stores. The decrease of $49,331,000, or 4%, in 2009 was due to decreased labor and benefits costs of $37,489,000, as a result of staff reductions, and decreased marketing expenses of $44,359,000, partly offset by a $28,716,000 increase in management incentive and stock-based compensation. Excluding the nonrecurring items noted above, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been 39.2%, 40.2% and 40.0% in 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Company SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. The improvement in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2010 reflected the leverage effect from increased sales. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) represent approximately one-fifth of total SG&A expenses. TIFFANY & CO.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years amounts to conform to the current year presentation. Earnings from continuing operations increased 35% in 2010. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 2.9 percentage points primarily due to an increase in gross margin, as well as the leveraging of operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 0.7 percentage point due to an increase in gross margin, which was partly offset by an increase in marketing expenses associated with a major marketing and public relations event held in Beijing, China; Japan the ratio increased 2.6 percentage points primarily due to an increase in gross margin, which was partly offset by an increase in marketing expenses; Europe the ratio increased 4.9 percentage points primarily due to the leveraging of operating expenses, as well as an increase in gross margin; and Other the ratio increased 22.7 percentage points. The prior period operating loss included a valuation adjustment related to the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory deemed not suitable for the Company needs. Earnings from continuing operations increased 12% in 2009. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations to each segment net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 1.3 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin due to higher product costs; TIFFANY & CO. K - 32 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 0.8 percentage point due to a decline in gross margin due to higher product costs, partly offset by the leveraging of operating expenses; Japan the ratio increased 0.6 percentage point due to decreased operating expenses attributed to the cost savings initiatives, partly offset by a decline in gross margin due to higher product costs; Europe the ratio increased 0.6 percentage point due to operating expense leverage, partly offset by a decline in gross margin due to higher product costs; and Other the ratio decreased 21.8 percentage points due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds and the write-down of wholesale diamond inventory. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses increased in 2010 but decreased as a percentage of sales. In 2009, unallocated corporate expenses increased primarily due to changes in management incentive and stock-based compensation. Restructuring charges in 2008 represent a $97,839,000 pre-tax charge associated with the Company staff reduction initiatives (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note D. Restructuring Charges ). Other operating income in 2009 represents $4,442,000 of income received in connection with the assignment of the Tahera commitments and liens to an unrelated third party (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ). Other operating expense in 2010 represents $17,635,000 in accelerated depreciation and incremental rent expense associated with Tiffany plan to consolidate and relocate its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ). Other operating expense in 2009 represents $4,000,000 paid to terminate a third-party management agreement (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). Other operating expense in 2008 represents an $11,062,000 pre-tax impairment charge related to the Company investment in Target (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ). Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs decreased $706,000 in 2010. Interest expense and financing costs increased $26,064,000 in 2009 due to increased long-term borrowings. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Other income, net increased $2,465,000 in 2010 primarily due to a change in foreign currency gains/losses. Other income, net increased $4,446,000 in 2009 because 2008 included a $4,300,000 charge related to the impairment of unrealized gains and the interest receivable associated with interest rate swaps as the recovery of the amounts due from the counterparty, Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc., was no longer probable. TIFFANY & CO. K - 33 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 32.7% in 2010, compared with 31.9% in 2009 and 36.5% in 2008. The effective income tax rate for 2010 included a net income tax benefit of $3,096,000 primarily due to a change in the tax status of certain subsidiaries associated with the acquisition in 2009 of additional equity interests in diamond sourcing and polishing operations. The lower effective income tax rate in 2009 was primarily due to favorable reserve adjustments of $11,220,000 during the year associated with the settlement of certain tax audits and the expiration of statutory periods. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarter of 2008, management committed to a plan to close all IRIDESSE stores. All stores were closed in 2009. The results of the IRIDESSE business have been recorded in discontinued operations. The pre-tax net loss from discontinued operations related to that business was $6,103,000 in 2009 and $19,683,000 in 2008 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). The Company sold Little Switzerland, Inc. in 2007. In 2009, the Company received additional proceeds of $3,650,000 and recorded a pre-tax gain of $3,289,000 in settlement of post-closing adjustments (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note C. Acquisitions and Dispositions ). 2011 Outlook Management outlook is based on the following assumptions, which may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with Item 1A. Risk Factors on page K-15: A worldwide net sales increase of 12%-14%. Sales assumptions by region (in U.S. dollars) include a low-double-digit percentage increase in the Americas, at least a 20% increase in Asia-Pacific, a mid-single-digit percentage decline in Japan and more than a 20% increase in Europe. Other sales are expected to increase by more than 30%. Included in the above outlook for Japan, management has assumed some periodic store closings or limited store hours in Japan only through the end of the first quarter as a result of the earthquake-related events that occurred in March 2011. Management expects first quarter worldwide sales growth of 11%, with total Japan sales declining 15%. The opening of 21 Company-operated stores (eight in the Americas, eight in Asia-Pacific and five in Europe). An increase in operating margin of approximately one-half point due to both a higher gross margin reflecting a price increase taken in January 2011 to offset product cost increases and an improved ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales. Interest and other expenses, net of $46,000,000. An effective income tax rate of 34%. Net earnings per diluted share increasing 14% 18% to $3.35 $3.45. TIFFANY & CO. K - 34 Table of Contents An increase in net inventories of more than 15%. Capital expenditures of $250,000,000 $275,000,000. The above assumptions for operating margin and net earnings per diluted share exclude expenses of approximately $40,000,000 primarily related to the fair value of the remaining non-cancelable lease obligations (reduced by the estimated sublease rental income), as well as the acceleration of the useful lives of certain property and equipment and incremental rent during the transition period associated with Tiffany plan to consolidate and relocate its New York headquarters staff to a single location (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note L. Commitments and Contingencies ). Most of these expenses are expected to be recorded during the second quarter of 2011. Tiffany expects overall savings of more than $100,000,000 over the 15-year lease term of the new location as a result of an overall reduction in rent expense; these estimated savings are based on current rental costs and assumptions made regarding future potential rent increases at the existing locations. Changes in market conditions may affect the total expenses ultimately recorded. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditures needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows and the funds available under its revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to support the Company liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Within the next 12 months, $60,855,000 of the Company long-term debt will reach maturity and the Company intends to repay that debt with cash on hand. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 298,925 $ 687,199 $ 142,270 Investing activities (186,612 ) (80,893 ) (161,690 ) Financing activities (224,799 ) 10,538 (39,708 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 8,375 14,300 (18,035 ) Net cash used in discontinued operations (5,887 ) (9,046 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (104,111 ) $ 625,257 $ (86,209 ) Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $298,925,000 in 2010, $687,199,000 in 2009 and $142,270,000 in 2008. The decrease in 2010 from 2009 primarily TIFFANY & CO. K - 35 Table of Contents resulted from an increase in inventories. The increase in 2009 from 2008 primarily resulted from decreases in inventories and, to a lesser extent, lower income tax payments. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $2,204,632,000 and 5.6 at January 31, 2011, compared with $1,845,393,000 and 4.1 at January 31, 2010. The increase in working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to an increase in inventories and a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2011 were 17% higher than January 31, 2010, reflecting sales growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased accounts receivable balances by 5% compared to January 31, 2010. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 18 times in 2010 and 2009. Inventories, net at January 31, 2011 were 14% higher than January 31, 2010. Finished goods inventories rose 9% and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories rose 22%, all to support sales growth, new store openings and new product launches, as well as reflecting higher acquisition costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased inventories, net by 2% compared to January 31, 2010. In addition, inventory levels had been reduced in 2009 due to economic conditions and, further, inventories also finished 2009 lower than initially planned because of stronger-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter. Investing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from investing activities of $186,612,000 in 2010, $80,893,000 in 2009 and $161,690,000 in 2008. The increased outflow in 2010 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. The decreased outflow in 2009 was primarily due to a decline in capital expenditures. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $127,002,000 in 2010, $75,403,000 in 2009 and $154,409,000 in 2008, representing 4%, 3% and 5% of net sales in those respective years. The increase in 2010 largely reflected a moderated rate of store openings and other cost containment in 2009. In all three years, expenditures were primarily related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution facilities and ongoing investments in new systems. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had net purchases of investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of $59,610,000, $13,433,000 and $1,543,000 during 2010, 2009 and 2008. Financing Activities The Company had a net cash outflow from financing activities of $224,799,000 in 2010, a net cash inflow of $10,538,000 in 2009 and a net cash outflow of $39,708,000 in 2008. Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities are largely driven by borrowings and share repurchase activity. Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company Common Stock was increased twice in 2010, following no change in 2009 and one increase in 2008. The Company Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which, on an annual basis, totaled $0.95, $0.68 and $0.66 per common share in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Cash dividends paid were $120,390,000 in 2010, $84,579,000 in 2009 and $82,258,000 in 2008. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 33% in 2010, 32% in 2009 and 37% in 2008. TIFFANY & CO. K - 36 Table of Contents Share Repurchases. In January 2008, the Company Board of Directors amended the existing share repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program to January 2011 and to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional $500,000,000 of the Company Common Stock. In January 2011, the Company Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program ( 2011 Program ) and terminated the previously existing program. The 2011 Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $400,000,000 of its Common Stock through open market or private transactions. The 2011 Program expires on January 31, 2013. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as stock price, cash-flow forecasts and other market conditions. The Company share repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Cost of repurchases $ 80,786 $ 467 $ 218,379 Shares repurchased and retired 1,843 11 5,375 Average cost per share $ 43.83 $ 41.72 $ 40.63 The Company suspended share repurchases during the third quarter of 2008 in order to conserve cash. In January 2010, the Company resumed repurchasing its shares of Common Stock on the open market. At January 31, 2011, there remained $392,019,000 of authorization for future repurchases under the 2011 Program. At least annually, the Company Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Recent Borrowings. The Company had net repayments of or net proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Short-term borrowings: Proceeds from (repayment of) credit facility borrowings, net $ 9,170 $ (126,811 ) $ 103,976 Proceeds from issuance of other short-term borrowings 116,001 Repayments of other short-term borrowings (93,000 ) (25,473 ) Net proceeds from (repayments of) short-term borrowings 9,170 (219,811 ) 194,504 Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from issuance 118,430 300,000 100,000 Repayments (218,845 ) (40,000 ) (73,483 ) Net (repayments of) proceeds from long-term borrowings (100,415 ) 260,000 26,517 Net (repayments of) proceeds from total borrowings $ (91,245 ) $ 40,189 $ 221,021 In July 2009, the Company entered into a $400,000,000 revolving Credit Facility ( Credit Facility ). Borrowings may currently be made from nine participating banks and are at interest rates based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin based on the Company leverage ratio. The Credit Facility matures in July 2012. There was $38,891,000 outstanding and $407,109,000 TIFFANY & CO. K - 37 Table of Contents available under the Credit Facility and other revolving credit facilities at January 31, 2011. The weighted-average interest rate for the outstanding amount at January 31, 2011 was 3.06%. Proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt and other short-term borrowings were used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The long-term debt issued during 2010 has a maturity date of 2016 with an interest rate of 1.72%. The long-term debt issued during 2009 has maturity dates that range from 2017 to 2019 with interest rates of 10.00%. The long-term debt issued during 2008 has a maturity date of 2015 with an interest rate of 9.05%. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note I. Debt for additional details regarding recent borrowings. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders equity was 32% and 40% at January 31, 2011 and 2010. At January 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Purchase of Non-controlling Interests. In October 2009, the Company acquired all non-controlling interests in two majority-owned entities that indirectly engage through majority-owned subsidiaries in diamond sourcing and polishing operations in South Africa and Botswana, respectively, for total consideration of $18,000,000, of which $11,000,000 was paid in 2009 and the remaining $7,000,000 was paid during 2010. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2011: 2012- 2014- (in thousands) Total 2011 2013 2015 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 1,273,066 $ 151,742 $ 267,513 $ 213,661 $ 640,150 Inventory purchase obligations a 305,442 193,442 112,000 Interest on debt b 274,056 45,559 84,099 81,332 63,066 Other contractual obligations c 36,815 32,594 2,221 2,000 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 38,891 38,891 Long-term debt 649,349 60,855 62,531 104,252 421,711 $ 2,577,619 $ 523,083 $ 528,364 $ 401,245 $ 1,124,927 a) The Company will, from time to time, secure supplies of diamonds by agreeing to purchase a defined portion of a mine output. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated for 2011 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2011 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. b) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. Variable-rate interest payments were estimated based on rates at January 31, 2011. Actual payments will differ based on changes in interest rates. c) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $25,000,000 to the pension plan in 2011. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset TIFFANY & CO. K - 38 Table of Contents performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $2,649,000 in 2011. Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2011 of $32,273,000 and accrued interest and penalties of $4,189,000. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Ongoing audits are in various stages of completion and, while the Company does not anticipate any material changes in unrecognized income tax benefits over the next 12 months, future developments in the audit process may result in a change in these assessments. The following is a summary of the Company outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Credit Facility and other revolving credit facilities at January 31, 2011: Total Borrowings Available (in thousands) Capacity Outstanding Capacity Credit Facility* $ 400,000 $ 14,888 $ 385,112 Other revolving credit facilities 46,000 24,003 21,997 $ 446,000 $ 38,891 $ 407,109 * This facility matures in July 2012. The Company can request to increase the capacity up to $500,000,000. In addition, the Company had letters of credit and financial guarantees of $25,281,000 at January 31, 2011, of which $22,032,000 expire within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing at least one-third of annual net sales and approximately one-half of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market TIFFANY & CO. K - 39 Table of Contents value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2011, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $4,843,000 in inventory and cost of sales. The Company inventories are valued using the average cost method. Fluctuation in inventory levels, along with the costs of raw materials, could affect the carrying value of the Company inventory. Long-lived assets . The Company long-lived assets are primarily property, plant and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2010, 2009 or 2008. Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2010, 2009 and 2008 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. The Company income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. In evaluating the Company ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and TIFFANY & CO. K - 40 Table of Contents other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 6.50% and 6.75% to determine its 2010 pension expense for all U.S. plans and 6.75% to determine its 2010 postretirement expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2010 pension and postretirement expenses by $2,826,000 and $226,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2010 pension and postretirement expenses by $3,640,000 and $294,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2010 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2010 pension expense by $1,171,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, 9.00% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 7.50% (for post-age 65 retirees) annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2011. The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2010 postretirement expense. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. TIFFANY & CO. K - 41 Table of Contents
