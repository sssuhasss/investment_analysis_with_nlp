ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative new products and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our business. Our specific growth objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability; and improvement in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We return a substantial amount of cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. In fiscal 2013 we maintained focus on our core strategies of brand building investment, international expansion, customer partnerships, product innovation and holistic margin management (HMM) initiatives, and we continued to invest for future growth. For the fiscal year ended May 26, 2013, our net sales grew 7 percent and total segment operating profit grew 6 percent. Our return on average total capital declined by 80 basis points primarily due to the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S., Yoplait Marques S.A.S., and Yoki Alimentos S.A. (Yoki). Diluted EPS grew 19 percent and diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability increased 5 percent (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our discussion of total segment operating profit, diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.9 billion in fiscal 2013, enabling us to partially fund the acquisition of Yoki and to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 8 percent from fiscal 2012. We also made significant capital investments totaling $614 million in fiscal 2013 and repurchased $1.0 billion of shares of common stock. We achieved the following related to our key operating objectives for fiscal 2013: We increased our worldwide sales base and strengthened our portfolio by making key strategic acquisitions that expanded our participation in fast-growing food categories and emerging markets, and grew net sales by 7 percent. We sustained a high level of new product activity, and executed effective marketing and merchandising actions in support of our leading brands and global platforms around the world. We achieved a 6 percent increase in total segment operating profit driven by our ongoing HMM program, the effect of our restructuring plan announced in May 2012, volume growth from existing businesses, and contributions from new businesses. 17 Table of Contents Our strong cash flows allowed us to fund the acquisition of new businesses in fiscal 2013 and also repurchase sufficient shares of company stock to more than offset stock option exercises during the year. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2013 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. In fiscal 2014, we expect to generate growth consistent with our long term model: We have a strong line-up of consumer marketing, merchandising, and innovation planned to support our leading brands. We will continue to build our global platforms in markets around the world, accelerating our efforts in rapidly growing emerging markets. We are targeting low single-digit growth in net sales driven by volume growth, with incremental contributions from new businesses added in fiscal 2013. We are targeting mid single-digit growth in total segment operating profit in fiscal 2014 including incremental contributions from new businesses. We expect our HMM discipline of cost savings and mix management to more than offset expected input cost inflation. We are targeting high single-digit growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability. We expect to deliver increased cash returns to shareholders in fiscal 2014, including a 15 percent dividend increase and share repurchases that are expected to result in a 2 percent net reduction in shares outstanding. Our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows and we will use some of this cash to reinvest in our business. Our fiscal 2014 plans call for approximately $700 million of expenditures for capital projects. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2013 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our consolidated results for fiscal 2013 include operating activity from the acquisitions of Yoki in Brazil, Yoplait Ireland, Food Should Taste Good in the United States, Parampara Foods in India, Immaculate Baking Company in the United States, and the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license (Yoplait Canada). Also included in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 are two additional months of results from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Collectively, these items are referred to as new businesses. Fiscal 2013 net sales grew 7 percent to $17,774 million. In fiscal 2013, net earnings attributable to General Mills was $1,855 million, up 18 percent from $1,567 million in fiscal 2012, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.79 in fiscal 2013, up 19 percent from $2.35 in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2013 results include the effects from various discrete tax items, restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2012 productivity and cost savings plan, integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Yoki, and gains from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. Fiscal 2012 results include losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, restructuring charges related to our 2012 productivity and cost savings plan, and integration costs resulting from the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability totaled $2.69 in fiscal 2013, up 5 percent from $2.56 in fiscal 2012 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). 18 Table of Contents The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2013 vs. 2012 Contributions from volume growth (a) 9 pts Net price realization and mix (1) pt Foreign currency exchange (1) pt Net sales growth 7 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales grew 7 percent in fiscal 2013, including 6 percentage points of growth contributed by new businesses, primarily Yoki, Yoplait S.A.S., and Yoplait Canada. Excluding the impact of new businesses, net sales grew 2 percent, partially offset by 1 percentage point of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Contributions from volume growth increased net sales by 9 percentage points, including 8 percentage points of contribution from volume growth due to new businesses. Unfavorable net price realization and mix decreased net sales growth by 1 percentage point and unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased net sales growth by 1 percentage point. Cost of sales increased $737 million in fiscal 2013 to $11,350 million. Higher volume drove a $982 million increase in cost of sales. We also recorded a $17 million non-recurring expense related to the assumption of the Canadian Yoplait franchise license in fiscal 2013. These increases were partially offset by a $154 million decrease in cost of sales attributable to product mix. In fiscal 2013, we recorded a $4 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net increase of $104 million in fiscal 2012. Gross margin grew 6 percent in fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 36 percent was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up $172 million in fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by the addition of new businesses and an increase in pension expense. In addition, we recorded a $25 million foreign exchange loss resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary following the devaluation of the bolivar in fiscal 2013. Excluding these items, SG&A expenses decreased compared to last year, including a 2 percent decrease in advertising and media expense compared to fiscal 2012. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales were flat compared to fiscal 2012. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $20 million in fiscal 2013 as follows: Expense, in Millions Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced $ 19.8 Total $ 19.8 In fiscal 2013, we recorded a $19 million restructuring charge related to a productivity and cost savings plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, consisting of $11 million of employee severance expense and other exit costs of $8 million. All of our operating segments were affected by these actions including $16 million related to our International segment, $2 million related to our U.S. Retail segment, and $1 million related to our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. These restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded $1 million of charges associated with other previously announced restructuring actions. In fiscal 2013, we paid $80 million in cash related to restructuring actions. Interest, net for fiscal 2013 totaled $317 million, $35 million lower than fiscal 2012. The average interest rate decreased 60 basis points, including the effect of the mix of debt, generating a $43 million decrease in net interest. Average interest bearing instruments increased $167 million, primarily from an increase in incremental borrowing to fund the acquisition of Yoki, generating an $8 million increase in net interest. 19 Table of Contents Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 29.2 percent compared to 32.1 percent in fiscal 2012. The 2.9 percentage point decrease was primarily related to the restructuring of our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which resulted in a $63 million decrease to deferred income tax liabilities related to the tax basis of the investment in GMC and certain distributed assets, with a corresponding discrete non-cash reduction to income taxes. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded a $34 million discrete decrease in income tax expense and an increase in our deferred tax assets related to certain actions taken to restore part of the tax benefits associated with Medicare Part D subsidies which had previously been reduced in fiscal 2010 with the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Our fiscal 2013 tax expense also includes a $12 million charge associated with the liquidation of a corporate investment. After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2013 increased to $99 million compared to $88 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher tax rates in fiscal 2012 as a result of discrete tax items and higher operating profit offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange in fiscal 2013. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2013 vs. 2012 CPW (1) % HDJ (2) Joint Ventures (1) % In fiscal 2013, CPW net sales declined by 1 percentage point as 2 percentage points of net sales growth from favorable net price realization and mix were offset by 3 percentage points of net sales decline from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Contribution from volume growth was flat compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, net sales for HDJ decreased 2 percentage points from fiscal 2012 as 6 percentage points of net sales growth from volume contribution was offset by 7 percentage points of net sales decline from unfavorable foreign currency exchange and 1 percentage point of net sales decline attributable to unfavorable net price realization and mix. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 1 million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012, due primarily to the repurchase of 24 million shares, including 6 million purchased under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. FISCAL 2013 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Cash and cash equivalents increased $270 million from fiscal 2012, as discussed in the Liquidity section below. Receivables increased $123 million from fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Yoki. Inventories increased $67 million from fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Yoki. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $80 million from fiscal 2012, mainly due to an increase in other receivables related to the liquidation of a corporate investment. Land, buildings, and equipment increased $225 million from fiscal 2012, as $614 million of capital expenditures and $216 million of additions from acquired businesses were partially offset by depreciation expense of $552 million. Goodwill and other intangible assets increased $750 million from fiscal 2012. We recorded $407 million of goodwill and $311 million of other intangible assets related to acquisitions in fiscal 2013. 20 Table of Contents Other assets decreased $22 million from fiscal 2012, primarily related to the liquidation of a corporate investment. Accounts payable increased $274 million from fiscal 2012, primarily due to the acquisition of Yoki and the extension of payment terms. Long-term debt, including current portion, and notes payable increased $540 million from fiscal 2012 primarily due to $1.0 billion of debt issuances, partially offset by $587 million of debt and commercial paper repayments. The current and noncurrent portions of net deferred income taxes liability increased $149 million from fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of contributions to our pension plan in fiscal 2013. Other current liabilities increased $401 million from fiscal 2012, primarily driven by increases in dividend accruals and trade and consumer accruals. Other liabilities decreased $237 million from fiscal 2012, primarily driven by a decrease in pension, postemployment, and postretirement liabilities. Redeemable interest increased $120 million from fiscal 2012, primarily due to a $104 million increase in the redemption value of the redeemable interest. Retained earnings increased $744 million from fiscal 2012, reflecting fiscal 2013 net earnings of $1,855 million less dividends paid of $868 million and dividends declared of $243 million. Treasury stock increased $510 million from fiscal 2012, due to $1,015 million of share repurchases, including $270 million related to an ASR agreement, partially offset by $505 million related to stock-based compensation plans. Additional paid in capital decreased $142 million from fiscal 2012, including $30 million related to an ASR agreement. Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) decreased by $158 million after-tax from fiscal 2012, primarily driven by pension and postemployment activity of $144 million. Noncontrolling interests decreased $5 million in fiscal 2013. FISCAL 2012 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2012 net sales grew 12 percent to $16,658 million. In fiscal 2012, net earnings attributable to General Mills was $1,567 million, down 13 percent from $1,798 million in fiscal 2011, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.35 in fiscal 2012, down 13 percent from $2.70 in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 results include losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories versus fiscal 2011 which included gains. Fiscal 2012 results also include restructuring charges reflecting employee severance expense and the write-off of certain long-lived assets related to our 2012 productivity and cost savings plan and integration costs resulting from the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. Fiscal 2011 results include the net benefit from the resolution of uncertain tax matters. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability was $2.56 in fiscal 2012, up 3 percent from $2.48 in fiscal 2011 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2012 vs. 2011 Contributions from volume growth (a) 9 pts Net price realization and mix 3 pts Foreign currency exchange Flat Net sales growth 12 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. 21 Table of Contents Net sales grew 12 percent in fiscal 2012, due to 9 percentage points of contribution from volume growth, including 12 percentage points of volume growth contributed by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Net price realization and mix contributed 3 percentage points of net sales growth. Foreign currency exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2011. Cost of sales increased $1,686 million in fiscal 2012 to $10,613 million. This increase was driven by an $877 million increase attributable to higher volume and a $610 million increase attributable to higher input costs and product mix. We recorded a $104 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $95 million in fiscal 2011. Gross margin grew 2 percent in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased by 370 basis points from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. This decrease was primarily driven by higher input costs and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories in fiscal 2012 versus gains in fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up $189 million in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2012 decreased by 1 percentage point compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. and an 8 percent increase in advertising and media expense. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011, we recorded a net divestiture gain of $17 million consisting of a gain of $14 million related to the sale of a foodservice frozen baked goods product line in our International segment and a gain of $3 million related to the sale of a pie shell product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $102 million in fiscal 2012 as follows: Expense, in Millions Productivity and cost savings plan $100.6 Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 1.0 Total $101.6 In fiscal 2012, we approved a major productivity and cost savings plan designed to improve organizational effectiveness and focus on key growth strategies. The plan included organizational changes to strengthen business alignment, and actions to accelerate administrative efficiencies across all of our operating segments and support functions. In connection with this initiative, we eliminated approximately 850 positions globally and recorded a $101 million restructuring charge, consisting of $88 million of employee severance expense and a non-cash charge of $13 million related to the write-off of certain long-lived assets in our U.S. Retail segment. All of our operating segments and support functions were affected by these actions including $70 million related to our U.S. Retail segment, $12 million related to our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, $10 million related to our International segment, and $9 million related to our administrative functions. These restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2012, we paid $4 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2012 and previous years. Interest, net for fiscal 2012 totaled $352 million, $6 million higher than fiscal 2011. Average interest bearing instruments increased $792 million in fiscal 2012, primarily due to the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S., generating a $46 million increase in net interest. The average interest rate decreased 55 basis points, including the effect of the mix of debt, generating a $40 million decrease in net interest. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 32.1 percent compared to 29.7 percent in fiscal 2011. The 2.4 percentage point increase was primarily due to a $100 million reduction to tax expense recorded in fiscal 2011 related to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning corporate income tax adjustments for fiscal years 2002 to 2008. 22 Table of Contents After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2012 decreased to $88 million compared to $96 million in fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher effective tax rates as a result of discrete tax items in fiscal 2012. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2012 vs. 2011 CPW 4 % HDJ 11 Joint Ventures 5 % In fiscal 2012, CPW net sales grew by 4 percent due to 3 percentage points attributable to net price realization and mix, and a 2 percentage point increase from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decrease from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. In fiscal 2012, net sales for HDJ increased 11 percent from fiscal 2011 due to 7 percentage points of favorable foreign currency exchange, 3 percentage points due to an increase in volume, and 1 percentage point attributable to net price realization and mix. Average diluted shares outstanding increased by 2 million in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011, due primarily to the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises, partially offset by share repurchases. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Bakeries and Foodservice. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we realigned certain divisions within our U.S. Retail operating segment and certain geographic regions within our International operating segment. We revised the amounts previously reported in the net sales percentage change by division within our U.S. Retail segment and geographic regions within our International segment. These realignments had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating segments net sales, operating profit, segment operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share. In the U.S. Retail segment, Big G, Snacks, Yoplait, and Small Planet Foods were unchanged. Baking Products combines our baking aisle and refrigerated dough products. Frozen Foods includes our frozen products, as well as Green Giant canned vegetables. Meals includes dinner mixes, side dishes, Mexican products, and Progresso soups. In the International segment, Canada was unchanged. The Australia and New Zealand businesses were realigned with our Europe region. The Turkey, North Africa, South Africa, and Middle East businesses were realigned with our Asia/Pacific region. 23 Table of Contents The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011: Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011 In Millions Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Net Sales U.S. Retail $ 10,614.9 60 % $ 10,480.2 63 % $ 10,163.9 69 % International 5,200.2 29 4,194.3 25 2,875.5 19 Bakeries and Foodservice 1,959.0 11 1,983.4 12 1,840.8 12 Total $ 17,774.1 100 % $ 16,657.9 100 % $ 14,880.2 100 % Segment Operating Profit U.S. Retail $ 2,392.9 75 % $ 2,295.3 76 % $ 2,347.9 80 % International 490.2 15 429.6 14 291.4 10 Bakeries and Foodservice 314.6 10 286.7 10 306.3 10 Total $ 3,197.7 100 % $ 3,011.6 100 % $ 2,945.6 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our product categories in this business segment include ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including granola bars, cereal, and soup. In fiscal 2013, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $10.6 billion, up 1 percent from fiscal 2012 due to contributions from volume growth. Net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012, net sales for this segment totaled $10.5 billion, up 3 percent from fiscal 2011. Net price realization and mix contributed 9 percentage points of growth, partially offset by a 6 percentage point decrease due to lower pound volume.

The 3 percentage point increase in the fiscal 2012 U.S. Retail segment net sales was driven by the Snacks, Big G, Baking Products, Small Planet Foods, and Meals divisions, partially offset by declines in the Yoplait division. Frozen Foods net sales were flat compared to fiscal 2011. Segment operating profit of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2013 improved $98 million, or 4 percent, from fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily driven by a 5 percent reduction in advertising and media expense, favorable net price realization and mix, and higher volume, partially offset by an increase in input costs. Segment operating profit of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2012 declined $53 million, or 2 percent, from fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily driven by higher input costs, lower volume, and a 5 percent increase in advertising and media expense. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT Our International segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses outside of the United States. In Canada, our product categories include ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, refrigerated yogurt, and grain and fruit snacks. In markets outside North America, our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, refrigerated yogurt, snacks, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, and dry dinners. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer is located. 25 Table of Contents As part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, we have changed the reporting period of certain countries within our International segment from an April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in the year of change, our results include 13 months of results from the affected operations compared to 12 months in previous fiscal years. In fiscal 2013, we changed the reporting period for our operations in Europe and Australia. The impact of these changes was not material to the fiscal 2013 International segment results of operations. Net sales for our International segment totaled $5,200 million in fiscal 2013, up 24 percent from $4,194 million in fiscal 2012. The growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by 21 percentage points from new businesses, primarily Yoki, Yoplait S.A.S., and Yoplait Canada. Excluding the impact of new businesses, net sales were up 3 percent. Volume contributed 34 percentage points of net sales growth, including 32 percentage points resulting from new businesses, partially offset by 6 percentage points of unfavorable net price realization and mix and 4 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Net sales totaled $4,194 million in fiscal 2012, up 46 percent from $2,876 million in fiscal 2011. The growth in fiscal 2012 was driven by 36 percentage points contributed by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. Volume contributed 65 percentage points of net sales growth, including 63 percentage points resulting from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S., and favorable foreign currency exchange contributed 1 percentage point of net sales growth. These gains were partially offset by a decrease of 20 percentage points due to unfavorable net price realization and mix resulting from the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S.

(b) Fiscal 2013 percentage change in net sales as reported for the Europe region includes 4 percentage points of growth due to an additional month of results. The impact to fiscal 2013 net sales growth for the International segment was not material. The 24 percentage point increase in the International segment fiscal 2013 net sales was driven by growth across all regions. On a constant currency basis, International segment net sales grew 28 percent, with 139 percent growth in the Latin America region, 15 percent growth in the Europe region, 22 percent growth in the Canada region, and 11 percent growth in the Asia/Pacific region. The 46 percentage point increase in the International segment fiscal 2012 net sales was driven by growth across all regions. On a constant currency basis, International segment net sales grew 45 percent, with 83 percent growth in the Europe region, 28 percent growth in the Canada region, 20 percent growth in the Asia/Pacific region, and 14 percent growth in the Latin America region. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2013 grew 14 percent to $490 million from $430 million in fiscal 2012, primarily driven by volume growth, the Yoki acquisition, and a full year of activity from Yoplait S.A.S., partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. During fiscal 2010, Venezuela became a highly inflationary economy. In February 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate. The effect of the devaluation in fiscal 2013 was a $25 million foreign exchange loss in segment operating profit resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to use the official exchange rate to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan operations, as we expect to remit dividends through transactions at the official rate. We do not expect that the effects of the devaluation will have a material impact on our results in the future. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2012 grew 47 percent to $430 million, from $291 million in fiscal 2011, primarily driven by the acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S., higher volume, and favorable foreign currency effects. BAKERIES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment our product categories include ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Substantially all of this segment operations are located in the United States. For fiscal 2013, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment decreased 1 percent to $1,959 million due to lower pound volume. Net price realization and mix was flat compared to fiscal 2012 as gains from favorable product mix were offset by declines in commodity index priced items. 27 Table of Contents For fiscal 2012, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 8 percent to $1,983 million. The increase in fiscal 2012 was driven by an increase in net price realization and mix of 7 percentage points and 1 percentage point contributed by volume growth.

The increase was primarily driven by favorable product mix, lower manufacturing and input costs, and reduced administrative costs. In fiscal 2012, segment operating profit was $287 million, down 6 percent from $306 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily driven by lower grain merchandising earnings. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2013, unallocated corporate expense totaled $326 million compared to $348 million last year. In fiscal 2013 we recorded a $4 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $104 million net increase in expense last year. Pension expense increased $40 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, we also recorded $12 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of Yoki. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $348 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $184 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, we recorded a $104 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $95 million net decrease in expense in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, we also recorded $11 million of integration costs related to the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. These increases in expense were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefit expense compared to fiscal 2011. IMPACT OF INFLATION We have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of 3 percent input cost inflation, primarily on commodities inputs. We expect the rate of inflation of commodities and energy costs to be consistent in fiscal 2014. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. 28 Table of Contents The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act) was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Because the Act does not take effect fully until future years, the Act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2013, 2012, or 2011 results of operations. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, the full impact of the Act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $6.9 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions. As of May 26, 2013, we had $714 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions. There is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriate cash held in foreign jurisdictions, we expect to do so only in a tax-neutral manner. Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2013 2012 2011 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 1,892.5 $ 1,589.1 $ 1,803.5 Depreciation and amortization 588.0 541.5 472.6 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (98.8 ) (88.2 ) (96.4 ) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 115.7 68.0 72.7 Stock-based compensation 100.4 108.3 105.3 Deferred income taxes 81.8 149.4 205.3 Tax benefit on exercised options (103.0 ) (63.1 ) (106.2 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (223.2 ) (222.2 ) (220.8 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense 131.2 77.8 73.6 Divestitures (gain) (17.4 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (60.2 ) 97.8 (1.3 ) Changes in current assets and liabilities 471.1 243.8 (720.9 ) Other, net 30.5 (95.0 ) (38.9 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,926.0 $ 2,407.2 $ 1,531.1 In fiscal 2013, our operations generated $2.9 billion of cash compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2012. The $519 million increase is primarily due to a $303 million increase in net earnings and $227 million from changes in current assets and liabilities. Other current liabilities accounted for $336 million of the increase in current assets and liabilities due to trade and tax accruals, and accounts payable accounted for $252 million of the increase partly as the result of the extension of payment terms. These were partially offset by a $214 million change in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to changes in derivative receivables and changes in other receivables related to the liquidation of a corporate investment, and a $126 million change in inventory largely driven by a lower level of inventory reduction activity compared to fiscal 2012. In both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we made a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans. In addition, we paid $80 million in cash related to restructuring actions in fiscal 2013. 29 Table of Contents We strive to grow core working capital at or below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2013, core working capital decreased 5 percent, compared to net sales growth of 7 percent, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable. In fiscal 2012, core working capital decreased 7 percent, compared to net sales growth of 12 percent, and in fiscal 2011, core working capital increased 16 percent, compared to net sales growth of 2 percent. In fiscal 2012, our operations generated $2.4 billion of cash compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2011. The $876 million increase primarily reflects changes in current assets and liabilities, including a $384 million increase driven by inventory reduction efforts in fiscal 2012. Prepaid expenses and other current assets accounted for a $245 million increase, primarily reflecting changes in foreign currency hedges and the fair value of open grain contracts. Other current liabilities accounted for a $386 million increase, primarily reflecting changes in accrued income taxes as a result of audit settlements and court decisions in fiscal 2011 and changes in consumer marketing and related accruals. The favorable change in working capital was offset by a $214 million decrease in net earnings. Additionally, fiscal 2012 included non-cash restructuring charges of $101 million reflecting employee severance expense and the write-off of certain long-lived assets. In both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, we made a $200 million voluntary contribution to our principal domestic pension plans. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2013 2012 2011 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (613.9 ) $ (675.9 ) $ (648.8 ) Acquisitions (898.0 ) (1,050.1 ) (123.3 ) Investments in affiliates, net (40.4 ) (22.2 ) (1.8 ) Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 24.2 2.2 4.1 Proceeds from divestiture of product lines 34.4 Exchangeable note 16.2 (131.6 ) Other, net (3.5 ) 6.8 20.3 Net cash used by investing activities $ (1,515.4 ) $ (1,870.8 ) $ (715.1 ) In fiscal 2013, cash used by investing activities decreased by $355 million from fiscal 2012. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we acquired Yoki, a privately held food company headquartered in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, for an aggregate purchase price of $940 million, comprised of $820 million of cash, net of $31 million of cash acquired, and $120 million of non-cash consideration for debt assumed. We invested $614 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2013, $62 million less than the same period last year. In addition, we received $16 million in payments from Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) in fiscal 2013 against the $132 million exchangeable note we purchased in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012, cash used by investing activities increased by $1.2 billion from fiscal 2011. The increased use of cash primarily reflected the acquisitions of Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. in fiscal 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion, comprised of $900 million of cash, net of $30 million of cash acquired, and $261 million of non-cash consideration for debt assumed. In addition, we purchased a zero coupon exchangeable note due in 2016 from Sodiaal with a notional amount of $132 million. We invested $676 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2012. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million in fiscal 2014. These expenditures will support initiatives that are expected to: increase manufacturing capacity for Greek yogurt; fuel International growth and expansion; and continue HMM initiatives throughout our supply chain. 30 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2013 2012 2011 Change in notes payable $ (44.5 ) $ 227.9 $ (742.6 ) Issuance of long-term debt 1,001.1 1,390.5 1,200.0 Payment of long-term debt (542.3 ) (1,450.1 ) (7.4 ) Proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 300.8 233.5 410.4 Tax benefit on exercised options 103.0 63.1 106.2 Purchases of common stock for treasury (1,044.9 ) (313.0 ) (1,163.5 ) Dividends paid (867.6 ) (800.1 ) (729.4 ) Distributions to noncontrolling and redeemable interest holders (39.2 ) (5.2 ) (4.3 ) Other, net (6.6 ) (13.2 ) (10.3 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (1,140.2 ) $ (666.6 ) $ (940.9 ) Net cash used by financing activities increased by $474 million in fiscal 2013. In January 2013, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate notes. The issuance consisted of $250 million 0.875 percent notes due January 29, 2016 and $500 million 4.15 percent notes due February 15, 2043. Interest on the fixed-rate notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The fixed rate notes due January 29, 2016 may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount. The fixed rate notes due February 15, 2043 may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at our option at any time prior to August 15, 2042 for a specified make whole amount and any time on or after that date at par. These notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds were used to reduce our commercial paper borrowings. In January 2013, we issued $250 million floating rate notes due January 29, 2016. The floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points, subject to quarterly reset. Interest on the floating-rate notes is payable quarterly in arrears. The floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. These notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds were used to reduce our commercial paper borrowings. In September 2012, we repaid $521 million of 5.65 percent notes. In February 2012, we repaid $1.0 billion of 6.0 percent notes. In November 2011, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.15 percent notes due December 15, 2021. The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our notes due February 2012, reduce our commercial paper borrowings, and for general corporate purposes. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time prior to September 15, 2021 for a specified make whole amount and any time on or after that date at par. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. As part of our acquisition of Yoplait S.A.S. in fiscal 2012, we consolidated $458 million of primarily euro-denominated Euribor-based floating-rate bank debt. In December 2011, we refinanced this debt with $390 million of euro-denominated Euribor-based floating-rate bank debt due at various dates through December 15, 2014. In May 2011, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 1.55 percent fixed-rate notes and $400 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate notes, both due May 16, 2014. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. The floating-rate notes bear interest equal to three-month LIBOR plus 35 basis points, subject to quarterly reset. Interest on the floating-rate notes is payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on the fixed-rate notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The fixed-rate notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. In June 2010, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4 percent notes due 2040. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. 31 Table of Contents During fiscal 2013, we had $301 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $234 million in fiscal 2012, an increase of $67 million. During fiscal 2011, we had $410 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options. In June 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. During fiscal 2013, we paid $1,015 million to repurchase 24 million shares of our common stock, including 6 million shares with a fair value of $270 million purchased as part of an ASR agreement. Under the terms of the ASR agreement, we also paid an additional $30 million to the unrelated financial institution for shares which will be settled in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased 8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $313 million. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 32 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,164 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2013 totaled $868 million, or $1.32 per share, an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2012. Dividends paid in fiscal 2012 totaled $800 million, or $1.22 per share, a 9 percent per share increase from fiscal 2011 dividends of $1.12 per share. On March 12, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, effective with the August 1, 2013 payment, to an annual rate of $1.52 per share, a 15 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2013. Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2013 2012 2011 Advances to joint ventures, net $ (36.7 ) $ (22.2 ) $ (1.8 ) Dividends received 115.7 68.0 72.7 CAPITAL RESOURCES Total capital consisted of the following: In Millions May 26, 2013 May 27, 2012 Notes payable $ 599.7 $ 526.5 Current portion of long-term debt 1,443.3 741.2 Long-term debt 5,926.1 6,161.9 Total debt 7,969.1 7,429.6 Redeemable interest 967.5 847.8 Noncontrolling interests 456.3 461.0 Stockholders equity 6,672.2 6,421.7 Total capital $ 16,065.1 $ 15,160.1 32 Table of Contents The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May 26, 2013: In Billions Amount Credit facility expiring: April 2015 $1.0 April 2017 1.7 Total committed credit facilities 2.7 Uncommitted credit facilities 0.3 Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities $3.0 To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.7 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines, consisting of a $1.0 billion facility expiring in April 2015 and a $1.7 billion facility expiring in April 2017. We also have $333 million in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations. As of May 26, 2013, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and $84 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 26, 2013, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $1,443 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 26, 2013, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 73 percent in fixed-rate and 27 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 71 percent in fixed-rate and 29 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 27, 2012. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages was driven by the issuance of fixed rate bonds in January 2013. Growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Return on average total capital decreased from 12.7 percent in fiscal 2012 to 11.9 percent in fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. We also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2013 was 7.62 compared to 6.26 in fiscal 2012. The measure increased from fiscal 2012 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased by $324 million and fixed charges decreased by $32 million, driven primarily by lower interest. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 4.3 percentage points to 36.7 percent in fiscal 2013, driven by a higher rate of increase in cash flows from operations than in total debt. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait S.A.S. and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. We consolidated both entities into our consolidated financial statements. At the date of the acquisition, we recorded the $264 million fair value of Sodiaal 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques S.A.S. as a noncontrolling interest, and the $904 million fair value of its 49 percent interest in Yoplait S.A.S. as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years. As of May 26, 2013, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $968 million which approximates its fair value. 33 Table of Contents During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, in conjunction with the consent of the Class A investor, we restructured GMC through the distribution of its manufacturing assets, stock, inventory, cash and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary. GMC retained the remaining intellectual property. Immediately following the restructuring, the Class A Interests of GMC were sold by the then current holder to another unrelated third-party investor. The third-party holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 110 basis points, to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. The holder of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the Class A Interests, GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB- by Standard & Poor s, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. We may avoid liquidation by exercising our option to purchase the Class A Interests. We may exercise our option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third-party investor capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 26, 2013, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $356 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $259 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $438 million as of May 26, 2013. As of May 26, 2013, we had invested in four variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 26, 2013. We determined whether or not we were the primary beneficiary (PB) of each VIE using a qualitative assessment that considered the VIE purpose and design, the involvement of each of the interest holders, and the risks and benefits of the VIE. We are the PB of three of the VIEs. We provided minimal financial or other support to our VIEs during fiscal 2013, and there are no arrangements related to VIEs that would require us to provide significant financial support in the future. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. The PPA may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in each of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2014. Actual fiscal 2014 contributions could exceed our current projections, and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, interest rates, and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. 34 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year In Millions Total 2014 2015 -16 2017 -18 2019 and Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 7,372.8 $ 1,442.0 $ 1,680.8 $ 1,100.0 $3,150.0 Accrued interest 91.2 91.2 Operating leases (b) 437.7 93.4 135.1 94.7 114.5 Capital leases 4.2 1.8 2.2 0.2 Purchase obligations (c) 2,582.3 2,215.8 167.6 107.0 91.9 Total contractual obligations 10,488.2 3,844.2 1,985.7 1,301.9 3,356.4 Other long-term obligations (d) 1,816.3 Total long-term obligations $ 12,304.5 $ 3,844.2 $ 1,985.7 $ 1,301.9 $3,356.4 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $4 million for capital leases or $7 million for net unamortized bond premiums and discounts and fair value adjustments. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $36 million as of May 26, 2013, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $19 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $14 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2014. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2014. As of May 26, 2013, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $266 million. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising expenditures are generally recognized as expense when the advertisement airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer-related activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $635 million as of May 26, 2013, and $561 million as of 35 Table of Contents May 27, 2012. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We performed our fiscal 2013 assessment as of November 26, 2012, and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury , Totino , Progresso , Green Giant , Yoplait , Old El Paso , Yoki , and H agen-Dazs brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2013 assessment of our brand intangibles as of November 26, 2012. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. As of our assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values. As of May 26, 2013, we had $13.1 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. In addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary. 36 Table of Contents Redeemable Interest On July 1, 2011, we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait S.A.S., a consolidated entity. Sodiaal holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait S.A.S. Sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of 9 years. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest redemption value, which approximates its fair value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we adjusted the redeemable interest redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency rates, and a discount rate. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2013 volatility assumption would increase the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2013 option awards by 9 percent. Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 22 percent. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2013 2012 2011 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $3.65 $5.88 $4.12 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 1.6 % 2.9 % 2.9 % Expected term 9.0 years 8.5 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 17.3 % 17.6 % 18.5 % Dividend yield 3.5 % 3.3 % 3.0 % To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. 37 Table of Contents Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years financing cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years. The IRS initiated its audit of our fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 tax years during fiscal 2013. Currently, several state examinations are in progress. During fiscal 2013, the IRS concluded its field examination of our 2009 and 2010 tax years. The IRS has proposed adjustments related to the timing for deducting accrued bonus expenses. We believe our position is supported by substantial technical authority and have filed an appeal with the IRS Appeals Division. The audit closure and related proposed adjustments did not have a material impact on our current year results of operations or financial position. If we are unsuccessful in defending our position with respect to accrued bonuses, we will incur a one-time cash tax payment of approximately $80 million. As of May 26, 2013, we have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2008 and prior. Also during fiscal 2013, the California Court of Appeal issued an adverse decision concerning our state income tax apportionment calculations. We had previously recorded a $12 million increase in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2011 following an unfavorable decision by the Superior Court of the State of California related to this matter. We expect to pay a majority of the tax due related to this issue in fiscal 2014. The Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) reviewed our Canadian income tax returns for fiscal years 2003 to 2005 and raised assessments for these years to which we have objected. During fiscal 2013, the issue related to our 2003 fiscal year was resolved with no adjustment. The issue for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 is currently under review by 38 Table of Contents the U.S. and Canadian competent authority divisions. The CRA initiated its audit of our fiscal years 2008 through 2011 during fiscal year 2013. The CRA audit for fiscal 2008 was closed with no significant adjustments. The audit for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 is ongoing. We do not anticipate that any United States or Canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. As of May 26, 2013, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $266 million. We expect to pay approximately $12 million related to uncertain tax positions and accrued interest in the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering most employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in each of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2014. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. In fiscal 2012, we announced changes to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. All new salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013 are eligible for a new retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan. Current salaried employees remain in the existing defined benefit pension plan with adjustments to benefits. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2013. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act), was signed into law in March 2010. We continue to evaluate the effect of the Act, including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans. Postemployment Benefit Plans Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. 39 Table of Contents The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 25 percent to equities in the United States; 15 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 35 percent to fixed income; and 15 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). For other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were 16.5 percent, 4.5 percent, 9.5 percent, 7.9 percent, and 9.5 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 26, 2013. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 8.53 percent for fiscal 2013, 9.52 percent for fiscal 2012, and 9.53 percent for fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 8.6 percent due to generally lower expectations for long-term rates of return across our asset classes due to the recent global economic slowdown and our expectation of an extended time frame for recovery. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $56 million for fiscal 2014. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Obligations as of May 26, 2013, and fiscal 2014 expense 4.54 % 4.50 % 3.70 % Obligations as of May 27, 2012, and fiscal 2013 expense 4.85 % 4.70 % 3.86 % Fiscal 2012 expense 5.45 % 5.35 % 4.77 % Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2014 by approximately $89 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. 40 Table of Contents Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 8.0 percent for all retirees at the end of fiscal 2013. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: In Millions One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2014 $ 5.2 $ (4.4 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 26, 2013 93.8 (82.9 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2013, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $159 million compared to $106 million of expense in fiscal 2012 and $95 million of expense in fiscal 2011. As of May 26, 2013, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.6 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $176 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. We use the 2013 IRS Static Mortality Table projected forward to our plans measurement dates to calculate the year-end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act), was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the Act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Estimates of the future impacts of several of the Act provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur. 41 Table of Contents RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting disclosure requirements about the nature and exposure of offsetting arrangements related to financial and derivative instruments. The requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2013, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position. In February 2013, the FASB issued new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The requirements do not change the existing accounting and reporting for net income or other comprehensive income (OCI). The requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Management and the Board of Directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Total Segment Operating Profit This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management judgment, significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results. 42 Table of Contents The reconciliation of diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted EPS, the relevant GAAP measure, follows: Fiscal Year Per Share Data 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 2.79 $ 2.35 $ 2.70 $ 2.24 $ 1.90 Mark-to-market effects (a) 0.10 (0.09 ) 0.01 0.11 Divestitures gain, net (b) (0.06 ) Gain from insurance settlement (c) (0.04 ) Tax items (d) (0.13 ) (0.13 ) 0.05 0.08 Acquisition integration costs (e) 0.01 0.01 Restructuring costs (f) 0.02 0.10 Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 2.69 $ 2.56 $ 2.48 $ 2.30 $ 1.99 (a) See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. (b) Net gain on divestitures of certain product lines. (c) Gain on settlement with insurance carrier covering the loss of a manufacturing facility in Argentina. (d) The fiscal 2013 tax items consist of a reduction to income taxes related to the restructuring of our GMC subsidiary and an increase to income taxes related to the liquidation of a corporate investment. Additionally, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2010 include changes in deferred taxes associated with the Medicare Part D subsidies related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2009 tax items represent the effects of court decisions and audit settlements on uncertain tax matters. (e) Integration costs resulting from the acquisitions of Yoki in fiscal 2013 and Yoplait S.A.S. and Yoplait Marques S.A.S. in fiscal 2012. (f) See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Return on Average Total Capital This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates certain items which affect year-to-year comparability. 43 Table of Contents Fiscal Year In Millions 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests $ 1,892.5 $ 1,589.1 $ 1,803.5 $ 1,535.0 $ 1,313.7 Interest, net, after-tax 201.2 238.9 243.5 261.1 240.8 Earnings before interest, after-tax 2,093.7 1,828.0 2,047.0 1,796.1 1,554.5 Mark-to-market effects (2.8 ) 65.6 (60.0 ) 4.5 74.9 Tax items (85.4 ) (88.9 ) 35.0 52.6 Restructuring costs 15.9 64.3 Acquisition integration costs 8.8 9.7 Divestitures gain, net (38.0) Gain from insurance settlement (26.9) Earnings before interest, after-tax for return on capital calculation $ 2,030.2 $ 1,967.6 $ 1,898.1 $ 1,835.6 $ 1,617.1 Current portion of long-term debt $ 1,443.3 $ 741.2 $ 1,031.3 $ 107.3 $ 508.5 $ 442.0 Notes payable 599.7 526.5 311.3 1,050.1 812.2 2,208.8 Long-term debt 5,926.1 6,161.9 5,542.5 5,268.5 5,754.8 4,348.7 Total debt 7,969.1 7,429.6 6,885.1 6,425.9 7,075.5 6,999.5 Redeemable interest 967.5 847.8 Noncontrolling interests 456.3 461.0 246.7 245.1 244.2 246.6 Stockholders equity 6,672.2 6,421.7 6,365.5 5,402.9 5,172.3 6,212.2 Total capital 16,065.1 15,160.1 13,497.3 12,073.9 12,492.0 13,458.3 Accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss 1,585.3 1,743.7 1,010.8 1,486.9 877.8 (173.1) After-tax earnings adjustments (a) (234.4 ) (170.9 ) (310.5 ) (161.6 ) (201.1) (263.7) Adjusted total capital $ 17,416.0 $ 16,732.9 $ 14,197.6 $ 13,399.2 $ 13,168.7 $ 13,021.5 Adjusted average total capital $ 17,074.5 $ 15,465.3 $ 13,798.4 $ 13,283.9 $ 13,095.1 Return on average total capital 11.9 % 12.7 % 13.8 % 13.8 % 12.3% (a) Sum of current year and previous year after-tax adjustments. Net Sales Growth Rates for Our International Segment Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure of our International segment and region net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance in markets outside the United States by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign exchange markets. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. 44 Table of Contents Fiscal 2013 Percentage Change in Net Sales as Reported Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Percentage Change in Net Sales on Constant Currency Basis Europe 11 % (4 )pts 15 % Canada 22 22 Asia/Pacific 11 11 Latin America 116 (23 ) 139 Total International 24 % (4 )pts 28 % Fiscal 2012 Percentage Change in Net Sales as Reported Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Percentage Change in Net Sales on Constant Currency Basis Europe 84 % 1 pt 83 % Canada 29 1 28 Asia/Pacific 22 2 20 Latin America 12 (2 ) 14 Total International 46 % 1 pt 45 % CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and assumptions.
