Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios. Investment advisory clients outside the United States account for 7% of our assets under management at December 31, 2006. We manage a broad range of U.S. and international stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations. An unsettled environment surrounded the equity markets in the United States during the first seven months of 2006. The positive sentiment evoked by early January indications from the Federal Reserve that its series of tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end was soon tempered, as the Fed again raised its target short-term rate .25% at the end of January. It then added three more successive increases of .25% so that the target short-term rate was 5.25% at June 30. By the end of July, the equity markets were all posting year-to-date losses. The trend reversed in early August when the Federal Reserve discontinued its series of interest rate increases. Taken together with declines in energy costs and increasing optimism about the U.S. economy, a stock market rally ensued, continuing through the fourth quarter and into early 2007. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the biggest gainer in 2006, as it passed its January 2000 pre-market crash record in October, and closed the year up 16.3%. Other key indexes also posted strong results for 2006 as the S&P 500 gained 13.6% and the NASDAQ was up 9.5%. The overall positive market environment in the United States was also present around the world in 2006, with the Latin America region posting the strongest equity market performance. On a broader basis, the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) Index rose 23.5% during the year. The yield for 10-year U.S. Treasuries was 4.7% at December 31, 2006, up from nearly 4.4% at the start of the year, but down from the high of more than 5.2% in June. The yield curve was inverted at year-end 2006 with the six-month and two-year maturities yielding 38 and 11 basis points more, respectively, than the 10-year Treasuries. The Federal Reserve target short-term rate of 5.25% has remained unchanged since June 2006. In this financial environment, total assets under our management ended 2006 at a record $334.7 billion, up 24% or $65.2 billion during the year. Our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting a net of $27.8 billion to our management in 2006. Net inflows include $.8 billion from the merger of two fund groups into the T. Rowe Price funds and the acquisition of $.1 billion of separate account assets. Higher market valuations and income added $37.4 billion to our assets under management in 2006. Assets under management at December 31, 2006, include $267.0 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and $67.7 billion in fixed income investment portfolios. The underlying investment portfolios consist of $206.5 billion in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States and $128.2 billion in other investment portfolios that we manage, including separately managed accounts, sub-advised funds, and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and through variable annuity life insurance plans. We expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts may involve significant costs that generally precede the recognition of any future revenues that we may realize from increases to our assets under management. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. We split our common stock two-for-one in June 2006 and have accordingly restated our per-share results for 2004 and 2005 in the following discussion. 2006 versus 2005 . Investment advisory revenues were up 22% to $1.5 billion as a result of a $52.6 billion increase in average assets under our management to $299.7 billion. Net revenues increased 20% or $.3 billion to $1.8 billion. Net operating income increased 20% to $787 million from $655 million. Net income increased 23% to nearly $530 million from $431 million in 2005. Diluted earnings per share increased 20% from $1.58 to $1.90. On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment , and recognized $59.2 million of non-cash stock option-based compensation expense in 2006 using the fair value based method. Had we applied the fair value method in 2005, we would have recognized $59.8 million of additional stock option-based compensation expense. Our comparable pro forma diluted earnings for 2005 would then have been $1.43 per share and our 2006 diluted earnings per share of $1.90 would be 33% higher than 2005. See our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies accompanying our financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States increased 21%, or $.2 billion, to nearly $1.1 billion. Average mutual fund assets were $187.6 billion in 2006, 20% higher than the 2005 average of $156.2 billion. Mutual fund assets ended 2006 at $206.5 billion, 10% above the 2006 average. Net inflows to the mutual funds were $12.9 billion during 2006, including $6.6 billion that originated in our target-date Retirement Funds and $.8 billion from the merger of two fund groups into the Price funds. Our U.S. stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of $6.3 billion, while our international stock funds added $2.8 billion, and our bond and money market funds added $3.8 billion. The Growth Stock Fund added $4.2 billion of net investments this year while the Value Fund added more than $1.9 billion. Higher market valuations and income increased fund assets by $23.4 billion in 2006. - 14 - Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $80 million to $415 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $112.1 billion in 2006, up 23% or $21.2 billion from the 2005 average. Year-end assets totaled $128.2 billion, an increase of 14% from the 2006 average and up $28.9 billion from the start of the year. Net inflows from U.S. and international investors were $14.9 billion and market gains and income added $14.0 billion. Administrative fees and other income increased $29 million to $305 million. The change in these revenues includes $5.2 million from 12b-1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares. The balance of the increase is primarily attributable to our servicing activities, including shareholder accounts and transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. The change in administrative fees is generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that we incur to distribute the Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares through third party financial intermediaries and to provide the noted services to the funds and their investors. Operating expenses were $1.0 billion in 2006, up $171 million from 2005. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, increased $136 million or 26%. The number of our associates, their total compensation, and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased. The most significant portion of the increase is attributable to the $59.2 million non-cash expense recognized for 2006 stock option-based compensation. The 2006 increase also reflects greater bonus compensation based on our strong operating results for 2006 as well as our strong relative and risk-adjusted investment performance, our growth in assets under management including new investor inflows, and the high quality of our investor services. Finally, we modestly increase our associates base salaries at the beginning of each year, and have increased our average staff size by 5.4% versus 2005, primarily to handle increased volume-related activities and other growth. At December 31, 2006, we employed 4,605 associates. Advertising and promotion expenditures increased 13%, or $11.2 million, due to more favorable market conditions and investor interest in 2006. We expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in 2007 will be up about 10% versus 2006 and our spending in the first quarter of 2007 to be about the same as the $31 million expended in the fourth quarter of 2006. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $12.3 million. Our costs for rented office facilities, including increased space, and related equipment, maintenance and other costs have increased along with our staff size and business needs. Other operating expenses were up $11.4 million versus 2005, including $5.2 million of higher distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries that distribute our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares. These distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b-1 fees discussed above. Other operating expenses, including travel costs and consulting and information services, have risen this year to meet increased business demands. Overall, net operating income for 2006 increased 20% to $787 million and the operating margin was 43.4%, up .1% from 2005. Our net non-operating income, which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses and credit facility expenses, increased $47 million to $71 million. Larger money market mutual fund balances during 2006 at higher interest rates added $20.5 million of the increase, the liquidation of our sponsored 2001 collateralized bond obligation in 2006 added $11.0 million, and gains on dispositions of mutual fund investments added $6.3 million. The 2006 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 38.3%, up from 36.6% in 2005. Our 2006 income tax provision includes provisions of .6%, or $4.8 million, for the anticipated settlement of prior years taxes, .3% for increased state taxes, and .3% for the effect of non-deductible incentive stock option-based compensation expense that we began recognizing in our 2006 operating results. The 2006 provision also does not include the .2% benefit that we recognized in 2005 for the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the full year 2007 will be about 37.7%. 2005 versus 2004 . Investment advisory revenues were up 20%, or $207 million, to more than $1.2 billion due to the $40.2 billion increase in average assets under management. Net revenues increased $235 million to $1.5 billion. Net operating income increased nearly 25% to $655 million from $525 million. Net income increased $94 million to $431 million, up 28% from $337 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 25% from $1.26 to $1.58. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States increased $164 million to $900 million. Average mutual fund assets were $156.2 billion during 2005, $28.1 billion, or 22%, higher than the $128.1 billion average during 2004. Mutual fund assets ended 2005 at $170.2 billion, up $24.7 billion during the year. Additions to the U.S. mutual funds from the financial intermediary, individual direct and defined contribution retirement plan channels were $12.5 billion, basically unchanged from our 2004 experience when $12.7 billion was added to the funds. Investors added $9.7 billion into the U.S. stock funds, $2.1 billion into our international stock funds, and $.7 billion into our bond and money market funds. The Growth Stock, Capital Appreciation and Equity Income funds each added more than $1 billion of net investor inflows and, together, accounted for $6.5 billion of the funds net inflows. Cash inflows during 2005 also included nearly $400 million resulting from the merger of the TD Waterhouse Index Funds into four of the T. Rowe Price index funds. Higher market valuations and income, net of dividends not reinvested, added $12.2 billion to fund assets in 2005. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $42.5 million to $335 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $90.9 billion, up $12.1 billion, or 15%, from $78.8 billion in 2004. Ending assets in these portfolios were $99.3 billion, up $9.6 billion from the beginning of 2005. Market gains and income added $6.0 billion while net investor inflows were $3.6 billion, down from $8.0 billion in 2004. Net inflows from sub-advised and separate account clients investing in U.S. securities more than offset the net outflows from investors in some of our international investment portfolios. - 15 - Administrative fees and other income increased $28.3 million to $276 million. The change in these revenues includes $23.9 million from our servicing activities including shareholder account and transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Additionally, revenues increased $4.4 million from 12b-1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares. Operating expenses in 2005 were $105.4 million more than in 2004. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, increased $64.5 million, or 14%, from 2004. The number of our associates, their total compensation, and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased. Our bonus compensation is based on our operating results for the year, which for 2005 reflect our strong relative and risk-adjusted investment performance, continued growth in assets under management including new investment inflows, and sustained high-quality investor services. Base salaries for our associates are increased modestly at the beginning of each year, and we increased our average staff size 7% versus 2004, primarily to handle increased volume-related activities and growth. At December 31, 2005, we employed 4,372 associates, up 3% from the 2005 average staffing level. Advertising and promotion expenditures were up 16% or $11.8 million versus 2004. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the United States and abroad. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $10.3 million. Our costs for rented office facilities, including increased space, and related maintenance and operating costs have increased along with our staff size and business needs. Longer-lived buildings and non-depreciable land account for nearly two-thirds of the net book value of our property and equipment at December 31, 2005. Other operating expenses increased $18.8 million, including $4.4 million of distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries who distribute our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares. These distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from 12b-1 fees as discussed above. The cost of information services increased $7.3 million from 2004, primarily because of our decision to pay for non-broker-dealer third-party investment research and related services beginning in 2005. We previously made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain these services. Other operating expenses also rose in 2005 to include a $2 million increase in charitable contributions to our corporate foundation and to meet increased business demands. Our net non-operating income, which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest income and credit facility expenses, increased $15.9 million to $24.4 million. Larger money market and other mutual fund investment balances along with higher interest rates added $12.2 million to our investment income. Other net investment gains added $3.1 million, including $1.8 million realized as a result of the third-party acquisition of an entity in which we had invested. Credit facility costs were down $.6 million as we reduced the size and ongoing cost of our credit facility in mid-2004. The 2005 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 36.6%, down from 36.8% in 2004 due largely to the $1.4 million reversal of the valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards that is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During 2006, stockholders equity increased from $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion. Cash and investment holdings are $1.4 billion at December 31, 2006. Operating activities during 2006 provided cash flows of $593 million, up $54 million from 2005, including increased net income of $99 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $58 million. Timing differences in the cash settlements of our assets and liabilities reduced comparative cash flows by $107 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $421 million, up $330 million from 2005. Our investments in mutual funds and other securities made from our larger available cash balances were $272 million more in 2006 than in 2005. Capital spending for property and equipment was $94 million in 2006, up $42 million versus 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $203 million in 2006, up $59 million from 2005. We increased our expenditures for common stock repurchases by $95 million and our dividends paid to stockholders by $28 million. Offsetting these outflows were nearly $66 million of tax benefits realized from option exercises and restricted stock vesting in 2006. Comparatively, operating activities provided cash flows of nearly $540 million in 2005, up $165 million versus 2004. Net income accounted for nearly $94 million of the increase while timing differences in the cash settlements of our assets and liabilities added $66 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled nearly $92 million, up $16 million from 2004. Capital spending for property and equipment was $52 million in 2005, up $9 million from 2004 levels. Our mutual fund net investments were $37 million in 2005, an increase of $5 million from 2004. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $144 million in 2005, up $109 million from 2004. We expended $76 million in 2005 to repurchase 1.3 million shares of our common stock compared to $18 million for 400,000 shares in 2004. We also distributed $23 million more to our stockholders in 2005 based on our larger per-share quarterly dividend and collected $27 million less from option exercises that, at a lower rate in 2005, resulted in 1.8 million fewer shares being issued versus in 2004. Property and equipment expenditures in 2007, including those for the build-out of our expanded corporate and other business facilities, are anticipated to be about $170 million and are expected to be funded from cash balances. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table (in millions) presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2006. Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2007 and future years. - 16 - Total 2007 2008-9 2010-11 Later Noncancelable operating leases $ 213 $ 23 $ 43 $ 39 $ 108 Other purchase commitments 199 117 62 17 3 $ 412 $ 140 $ 105 $ 56 $ 111 We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional equity investments totaling $19.7 million at December 31, 2006. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in our statement of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2006 Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . We classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. We next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. A mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence, such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end, to overcome that presumption. We may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible. An impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security. A determination of this type is based on the issuer financial condition and our ability and intent to hold the investment until its fair value recovers, which may mean until maturity, and to collect all contractual cash flows. Minor impairments of 5% or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary. Goodwill . We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. We attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit, our investment advisory business. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds our carrying amount (basically, our stockholders equity) and, therefore, that no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet, $665.7 million. Stock options . On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R and began recognizing stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using the fair value based method. Prior to 2006, our stock option grants were accounted for using the intrinsic value based method and no compensation expense related to our option grants was recognized in our consolidated statements of income. The summary of significant accounting policies accompanying our consolidated financial statements includes certain pro forma disclosures for 2004 and 2005 as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow. - 17 - Provision for income taxes . After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in several states and several countries through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any prior year adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined. On January 1, 2007, we will adopt the provisions of recently issued FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , in regards to our accounting for and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. We have reviewed our accounting for income taxes in light of the provisions of FIN 48 and do not expect that adoption will materially affect our consolidated financial statements. FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income, changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management, our expense levels, and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A of this Form 10-K Annual Report under the caption Risk Factors. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios; fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management; our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios; and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the United States and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the United States; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option grants, stock awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general, or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.
