All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated. Captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, net income attributable to Air Products, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as income from continuing operations, net income, and diluted earnings per share throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated. The discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures. In 2012, the non-GAAP measures exclude the photovoltaic (PV) market actions charge, the polyurethane intermediates (PUI) business actions charge, the cost reduction plan charge, the customer bankruptcy charge, the gain on the previously held equity interest in DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials), the Spanish tax settlement, and the Spanish tax ruling. These non-GAAP measures exclude the net loss on Airgas transaction in 2011 and 2010. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 29-30. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries serve energy, electronics, chemicals, steel, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric, process and specialty gases; performance materials; equipment; and technology. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 50 countries, we have sales of $9.6 billion, assets of $16.9 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21,300 employees. We organize our operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2012 IN SUMMARY In 2012, the global economy proved to be more challenging than we expected and we did not see the anticipated economic growth we forecasted for the second half of the fiscal year. Global manufacturing grew approximately 3% for the year and limited the opportunities for growth, particularly in our Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Underlying volume growth was modest, and overall, sales declined by 1% resulting from a stronger dollar and lower energy cost pass-through partially offset by acquisitions. Our operating income declined 1% versus the prior year. In response to the current and forecasted economic environment, we took a number of important steps to position our global portfolio for future success. In Europe, we sold our homecare business and implemented a restructuring 18 program to better align our cost structure with the slower economy. We took actions to exit our polyurethane intermediates business and restructured our photovoltaic business to reflect current market conditions. Additionally, we executed on acquisition opportunities to support our growth strategies. In the Merchant segment, we acquired a controlling stake in Indura S.A., the largest independent gas company in Latin America. We also purchased a 25% position in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG), the largest industrial gas company in Saudi Arabia. Finally, in Electronics, we purchased the remaining 50% share of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture. Highlights for 2012 Sales of $9,611.7 decreased 1%, or $62.0, as unfavorable currency and lower energy raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers were partially offset by higher volumes and acquisitions. Operating income of $1,282.4 decreased 15%, or $225.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,533.7 decreased 1%, or $22.9, with positive impacts from new plants onstream in the Tonnage segment offset by weaker Merchant, Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment volumes. Unfavorable impacts from a stronger dollar were partially offset by cost productivity, improved pricing, and the impact of acquisitions. Income from continuing operations of $999.2 decreased 12%, or $135.1, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.66 decreased 11%, or $.56. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,158.6 decreased 1%, or $7.3, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.40 increased 1%, or $.04. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. Capital spending was $2,559.8 for the year ended 30 September 2012. On a non-GAAP basis, capital spending of $2,778.3 increased 80%, primarily from the acquisition of Indura S.A and the construction of new plants under contract with customers, primarily in the Tonnage Gases segment. We purchased .6 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $53.1 under the $1,000 share repurchase program announced in the fourth quarter of 2011. At 30 September 2012, $946.9 in share repurchase authorization remains. We increased our quarterly dividend from $.58 to $.64 per share. This represents the 30th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2013 Outlook discussions provided on page 20 in the Management Discussion and Analysis that follows. 19 Changes in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products 2012 2011 Increase (Decrease) Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $5.44 $5.63 $(.19 ) Income from discontinued operations .78 .41 .37 Income from Continuing Operations GAAP Basis $4.66 $5.22 $(.56 ) PV market actions .59 .59 Cost reduction plan .28 .28 PUI business actions .16 .16 Customer bankruptcy .03 .03 Gain on previously held equity interest (.25 ) (.25 ) Q1 Spanish tax settlement .20 .20 Q2 Spanish tax ruling (.27 ) (.27 ) Net loss on Airgas transaction .14 (.14 ) Income from Continuing Operations Non-GAAP Basis $5.40 $5.36 $ .04 Operating income (after-tax) Underlying business Volume/acquisitions (.14 ) Price/raw materials .05 Costs .11 Currency (.10 ) Operating Income (.08 ) Other (after-tax) Interest expense (.03 ) Income tax rate .03 Noncontrolling interests .05 Average shares outstanding .07 Other .12 Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Non-GAAP Basis $ .04 2013 OUTLOOK Our 2013 outlook for economic growth is based on the current lack of momentum we have experienced in the second half of 2012. We believe global economic growth in the regions in which we operate will again be modest in 2013 with a range from 2% 4%. We expect that the U.S. will continue to grow between 2% 4%. We do not anticipate any meaningful growth in Europe in the near future. In Asia, we expect below trend growth from 3% 5% as exports to other regions are slow. In South America, we expect growth of 2% 4%. We anticipate higher earnings in 2013 from new plant onstreams and from the loading of existing assets but recognize that this factor will be most influenced by the economy. We also anticipate higher earnings from our acquisition of Indura S.A. These gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense as a result of a decline in interest rates. We also expect lower earnings in 2013 as a result of restructuring our PUI business, unfavorable currency impacts, and a higher effective tax rate. We are focused on increasing productivity and managing costs in this challenging economic environment. The cost reduction actions implemented in 2012 should provide benefits in 2013 and beyond. Outlook by Segment In Merchant Gases, volume growth will continue to be influenced by the economy. We have available capacity in each region and will continue to utilize new applications to drive growth. We expect the business to benefit from the 2012 cost reduction actions in Europe. Results should also benefit from the acquisition of Indura S.A. Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from new plant onstreams in 2012 and 2013. These plants are supported by long-term take-or-pay contracts. 20 We are hopeful that Electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2013 following a weak 2012. Overall, we expect silicon growth of 4% 6% in 2013. For Performance Materials, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter of 2013 with volume growth limited until economic activity increases. Equipment and Energy results are expected to improve due to higher activity in our LNG equipment business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2012 2011 2010 Sales $9,611.7 $9,673.7 $8,616.1 Operating income GAAP Basis 1,282.4 1,508.1 1,267.7 Operating income Non-GAAP Basis 1,533.7 1,556.6 1,363.7 Operating margin GAAP Basis 13.3 % 15.6 % 14.7 % Operating margin Non-GAAP Basis 16.0 % 16.1 % 15.8 % Equity affiliates income 153.8 154.3 126.9 Sales % Change from Prior Year 2012 2011 Underlying business Volume 1 % 8 % Price % 2 % Acquisitions 2 % % Energy and raw material cost pass-through (2 )% % Currency (2 )% 2 % Total Consolidated Change (1 )% 12 % 2012 vs. 2011 Sales of $9,611.7 decreased 1%, or $62.0. Underlying business increased 1%, primarily due to higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment, which were partially offset by lower volumes in the Merchant Gases segment, particularly in Europe. Acquisitions increased sales by 2%. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers and currency both decreased sales by 2%. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales of $9,673.7 increased 12%, or $1,057.6. Underlying business increased 10%, with volumes up 8% and price up 2%. Volumes grew primarily from strong performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment, and growth in Asia in the Merchant Gases segment. Currency favorably impacted sales 2%. Operating Income 2012 vs. 2011 Operating income of $1,282.4 decreased 15%, or $225.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,533.7 decreased 1%, or $22.9. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable volumes, including acquisitions, of $39 and unfavorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $30, partially offset by lower costs of $31 and higher recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $15. The decrease in volumes was primarily from lower Merchant Gases volumes and unfavorable volume mix due to lower LNG plant sales. On a GAAP basis, current year operating income includes a charge of $327.4 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. The prior year operating income includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. 2011 vs. 2010 Operating income of $1,508.1 increased 19%, or $240.4. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,556.6 increased 14%, or $192.9. Underlying business increased $171, primarily from higher volumes in all segments and 21 higher recovery of raw material costs in pricing, partially offset by higher operating costs. Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $22. On a GAAP basis, operating income in 2011 includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. 2010 included a $96.0 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. Equity Affiliates Income 2012 vs. 2011 Income from equity affiliates of $153.8 decreased $.5. 2011 vs. 2010 Income from equity affiliates of $154.3 increased $27.4, or 22%. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes and price, and favorable currency and foreign exchange. Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 2012 vs. 2011 S&A expense of $946.8 increased $5.1, or 1%, primarily due to acquisitions and inflation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and favorable currency. S&A as a percent of sales increased to 9.9% from 9.7%. 2011 vs. 2010 S&A expense of $941.7 increased $55.1, or 6%, primarily due to unfavorable currency, inflation, and higher pension expense. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 9.7% from 10.3%. Research and Development (R&D) 2012 vs. 2011 R&D expense of $126.4 increased 6%, or $7.6, primarily due to the DA NanoMaterials acquisition. R&D as a percent of sales increased to 1.3% from 1.2%. 2011 vs. 2010 R&D expense of $118.8 increased 4%, or $4.1, primarily due to increased spending in the Energy business. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.2% from 1.3%. Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans In 2012, we recorded an expense of $327.4 ($222.4 after-tax, or $1.03 per share) for business restructuring and cost reduction plans in our Polyurethane Intermediates, Electronics and European Merchant businesses. The net loss is reflected on the consolidated income statements as Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans. The charges for these plans are excluded from segment operating income. During the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the Merchant business, and actions we are taking to right size our European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. This charge includes $80.8 for severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions and $6.0 for the write-down of certain assets. The charge relates to the businesses at the segment level as follows: $77.3 in Merchant Gases, $3.8 in Tonnage Gases, and $5.7 in Electronics and Performance Materials. The planned actions are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. By the end of 2013, we expect these actions to provide approximately $60 in annual savings. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed actions in the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business to improve costs resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share). We sold certain assets and the rights to a supply contract for $32.7 in cash at closing. A supply arrangement with terms at fair market value was established with the buyer to serve the retained product supply contracts so that our PUI production facility in Pasadena, Texas could permanently close. In connection with these actions, we recognized an expense of $26.6 for the net book value of assets sold and those committed to be disposed of other than by sale. The remaining charge was primarily related to contract terminations and an environmental liability. The PUI facility will be dismantled, with completion expected in fiscal year 2013. The costs to dismantle will be expensed as incurred and reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases business segment. Since we will have material ongoing involvement with the business through retained PUI product supply contracts, the results of this business will continue to be reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases Segment. 22 During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the photovoltaic (PV) market resulting in $186.0 of expense ($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Air Products supplies the PV market with both bulk and onsite supply of gases including silane. The PV market has not developed as expected and as a result, the market capacity to produce silane is expected to exceed demand for the foreseeable future. As a result, we have entered into negotiations to terminate a long-term, take-or-pay contract. We recorded a charge of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate the contract. Although a settlement could differ from this amount, we do not expect it to be material to our financial position. It is uncertain when, or if, a settlement will be reached. The remaining charge was recorded in connection with the expected loss on purchase commitments, the disposal of certain assets serving PV and Electronics customers, the write-down of inventory to its net realizable value, and the write-down of accounts receivable. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans, and Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions. Business Combinations Indura S.A. On 1 July 2012, we acquired a 51.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A. from the majority shareholder. On 3 July 2012, we acquired an additional 13.0% equity interest from other shareholders. Following the acquisition date, 100% of the Indura S.A. results are consolidated in our financial statements. The portion of the business that is not owned by the Company is recorded as noncontrolling interests. We paid cash consideration in Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of CLP113.8 billion ($227) for these interests. The acquisition of Indura S.A. was accounted for as a business combination. The results of Indura S.A. have been consolidated within our Merchant Gases business segment. For the year ended 30 September 2012, our Merchant Gases business segment includes Indura S.A. revenues of $140.0 and operating income of $8.4, which is net of acquisition related costs we incurred of $6.5. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction. DA NanoMaterials LLC On 2 April 2012, we closed on the acquisition agreement with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. to acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture DA NanoMaterials. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The year ended 30 September 2012 includes a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction. Net Loss on Airgas Transaction For the year ended 30 September 2011, $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) in net loss was recognized related to the Airgas transaction. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Customer Bankruptcy As a result of events which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) primarily related to the write-off of onsite assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill shutdown. The customer, which primarily received products from the Tonnage Gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in May 2012 and announced the mill shutdown in August 2012. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment results. We do not expect to recognize additional charges related to this customer. In April 2010, one of our customers emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. We received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the recovery of certain receivables that had been previously written off. 23 Pension Settlement Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant retirement date. We recognize pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. We recognized $11.5 of settlement charges in 2010. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income is presented in Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2012 vs. 2011 Other income of $47.1 increased $5.4, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and reimbursements from government grants for expense, partially offset by lower gains from the sale of assets. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2011 vs. 2010 Other income of $41.7 decreased $1.2, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange, offset mainly by reimbursements from government grants for expenses. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2012 2011 2010 Interest incurred $153.9 $138.2 $136.2 Less: Capitalized interest 30.2 22.7 14.3 Interest Expense $123.7 $115.5 $121.9 2012 vs. 2011 Interest incurred increased $15.7. The increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance and debt issuance costs related to the Indura S.A. acquisition, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest was driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization. 2011 vs. 2010 Interest incurred increased $2.0. The increase was driven by the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest, partially offset by a lower average debt balance. The change in capitalized interest was driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2012 vs. 2011 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 21.9% and 24.3% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The current year rate includes reductions in income tax expense of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3 related to the second quarter Spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer bankruptcy charge, offset by an increase to income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first quarter Spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans; Note 5, Business Combinations; Note 21, Income Taxes; and Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions. The prior year rate includes a reduction in income tax expense of $16.9 related to the Airgas transaction. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for details on this transaction. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% and 24.6% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. 24 2011 vs. 2010 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.3% and 24.0% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The tax rate included reductions in income tax expense of $16.9 and $35.9 for the Airgas transaction in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for details on this transaction. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.6% and 25.0% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discontinued Operations In January 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment. On 8 January 2012, we reached an agreement for The Linde Group to purchase our Homecare business in Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal, and Spain. This business represented approximately 80% of our total Homecare business revenues. The transaction with Linde closed on 30 April 2012. Total sale proceeds of 590 million ($777) were received in cash at closing. A gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share) was recognized on the sale of this business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. We are actively marketing the remaining portion of the Homecare business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We hope to close on the sale of this business before the end of calendar year 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) to write down the remaining business to its estimated net realizable value. Additional charges may be recorded in future periods, dependent upon the timing and method of ultimate disposition. The Homecare business is being accounted for as a discontinued operation. The results of operations and cash flows of this business have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction. Net Income 2012 vs. 2011 Net income was $1,167.3, compared to $1,224.2, and diluted earnings per share was $5.44, compared to $5.63.

Electronics sales increased 3% as the acquisition of DA NanoMaterials was partially offset by lower volumes of 2% and unfavorable currency of 1%. Performance Materials sales decreased 1% as lower pricing of 1% and unfavorable currency of 1% were partially offset by higher volumes of 1%. Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income and Margin Operating income of $425.6 increased 18%, or $64.5, and operating margin of 18.3% increased 250 bp. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $339.7 decreased 6%, or $21.4, primarily from unfavorable currency of $17 and lower recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $8, partially offset by lower operating costs of $3 and higher volumes, including acquisitions, of $1. Operating margin decreased 120 bp, primarily due to currency and volume mix. On a GAAP basis, current year operating income includes the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales of $2,291.5 increased 20%, or $386.8. Sales increased due to higher volumes of 15%, higher pricing of 3%, and favorable currency of 2%. Electronics sales increased 25%, reflecting increased volumes in tonnage, specialty materials, and the equipment business. Performance Materials sales increased 14% due to volume growth across all end markets globally, higher pricing related to increased raw material costs, and improved customer and product mix. 27 Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income Operating income of $361.1 increased 43%, or $109.3. The increase was primarily from higher volumes of $88, lower costs of $24, and favorable currency of $9, partially offset by lower recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $12. Operating margin improved 260 bp primarily due to higher volumes. Equipment and Energy 2012 2011 2010 Sales $420.1 $400.6 $472.2 Operating income 44.6 62.8 67.3 2012 vs. 2011 Sales of $420.1 increased 5%, or $19.5, reflecting higher air separation unit (ASU) activity. Operating income of $44.6 decreased 29%, or $18.2, reflecting lower LNG project activity. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2012 was $450, compared to $334 at 30 September 2011. It is expected that approximately $325 of the backlog will be completed during 2013. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales of $400.6 decreased 15%, or $71.6, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $62.8 decreased 7%, or $4.5, primarily due to a gain on the sale of an asset in the prior year and higher energy development spending, partially offset by higher LNG sales. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2011 was $334, compared to $274 at 30 September 2010. Other Other operating loss primarily includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO, and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments. Other also included stranded costs resulting from discontinued operations, as these costs were not reallocated to the businesses. 2012 vs. 2011 Other operating loss was $6.6, compared to $39.3 in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in stranded costs, a decrease in the LIFO pool adjustment as a result of decreases in inventory values and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by gains on asset sales in the prior year. 2011 vs. 2010 Other operating loss was $39.3, compared to $26.7 in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the LIFO pool adjustment as a result of significant increases in inventory values and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by gains on asset sales. 28 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis.

We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of 30 September 2012, we had $423.3 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of continuing operations of $454.4. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Further, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign funds in order to fund U.S. operations. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2012 2011 2010 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $1,765.1 $1,710.4 $1,485.0 Investing activities (2,435.2 ) (1,169.8 ) (1,014.3 ) Financing activities (78.4 ) (484.6 ) (579.3 ) Operating Activities For the year ended 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,765.1. Income from continuing operations of $999.2 reflected the non-cash gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9, the write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring and a customer bankruptcy of $80.2, and a non-cash tax benefit of $58.3 recognized as a result of the second quarter Spanish tax ruling. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for other non-cash items that include depreciation and amortization, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates, share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $100.1. The provision for the cost reduction and business restructuring plans resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities of $223.9, partially offset by a use of cash of $32.9 for payments made in relation to these plans. For the year ended 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $1,710.4. Income from continuing operations of $1,134.3 reflected the non-cash net loss of $48.5 related to the Airgas transaction. We also made cash payments of $156.2 related to the Airgas transaction. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $114.6, including $107.5 for an increase in inventory primarily to support growth in our Performance Materials business. For the year ended 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $1,485.0. Income from continuing operations of $941.6 reflected the non-cash net loss of $96.0 related to the Airgas transaction. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $362.6, including $104.9 for an increase in accounts receivable from higher sales and $281.3 for a decrease in accrued liabilities primarily due to pension plan contributions. Investing Activities For the year ended 30 September 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,435.2, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment and cash used for acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. In the fourth quarter, we acquired a controlling stake in Indura S.A. for $690. During the third quarter, we acquired E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. 50% interest in our joint venture DA NanoMaterials for $147. We also purchased a 25% equity interest in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG), an unconsolidated affiliate, for $155 in the third quarter. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the Indura S.A., DA NanoMaterials, and AHG transactions. For the year ended 30 September 2011, cash used for investing activities was $1,169.8, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment. We received proceeds of $94.7 from the sale of approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. For the year ended 30 September 2010, cash used for investing activities was $1,014.3, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment. Additionally, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6. 31 Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2012 2011 2010 Additions to plant and equipment $1,521.0 $1,309.3 $988.7 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 863.4 10.8 37.2 Short-term borrowings associated with SAGA acquisition (A) 60.9 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 175.4 45.8 4.8 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $2,559.8 $1,365.9 $1,091.6 Capital lease expenditures (B) 212.2 173.5 122.6 Noncurrent liability related to purchase of shares from noncontrolling interests (B) 6.3 42.0 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $2,778.3 $1,539.4 $1,256.2 (A) Noncash transaction. (B) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2012 totaled $2,559.8, compared to $1,365.9 in 2011, resulting in an increase of $1,193.9. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2012 and 2011. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Additional 2012 capital expenditures included the following items: $690 for a controlling interest in Indura S.A., $147 for E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. 50% interest in our joint venture DA NanoMaterials, and $155 for a 25% equity interest in AHG. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2012 totaled $2,778.3 compared to $1,539.4 in 2011. Capital lease expenditures of $212.2 increased by $38.7, reflecting higher project spending. 2013 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2013 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,750 and $1,850, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $2,000 and $2,200. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between $250 and $350. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately $1,000 associated with new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. Financing Activities For the year ended 2012, cash used for financing activities was $78.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $419.6 and included the issuances of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note on 3 November 2011 and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note on 13 September 2012, which were partially offset by the repayment of a 4.25% Eurobond of $400.3 on 10 April 2012. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $124.3 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of $514.9. For the year ended 2011, cash used for financing activities was $484.6. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $457.0 and included $234.3 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances as well as a $350.0 senior fixed-rate 2.0% note, which were partially offset by $156.0 in U.S. medium-term note maturities. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $148.2 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders and the purchase of 7.4 million treasury shares were uses of cash of $456.7 and $649.2, respectively. For the year ended 2010, cash used for financing activities was $579.3. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net use of cash (repayment) of $284.4 and included a $306.8 Eurobond and $74.2 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt repayments partially offset by $85.0 from the issuance of 32 an industrial revenue bond. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $88.1 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of $398.7. Discontinued Operations The sale of our European homecare business to The Linde Group generated proceeds of $776.6 and is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2012 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations, the sale of our European homecare business, and the issuance of long-term debt. At the end of 2012, total debt outstanding was $5,291.9 compared to $4,561.5, and cash and cash items were $454.4 compared to $421.4. Total debt at 30 September 2012 and 2011, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity, was 44.4% and 43.4%, respectively. Proceeds from long-term debt were $900.4. This included the issuance of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note on 3 November 2011 that matures on 3 November 2021, which was used for general corporate purposes. Additionally, a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note on 13 September 2012 that matures on 15 October 2017 was issued primarily to refinance commercial paper associated with the Indura S.A. business combination. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. An acquisition financing facility was arranged with Banco Santander, Chile to provide the initial financing required for the Indura S.A. business combination. This was a Chilean Peso (CLP) committed credit facility with a total commitment amount of CLP390 billion ($778). Of this facility, CLP347 billion ($693) was drawn on 3 July 2012 to fund the business combination and related expenses, and the balance of the commitment was cancelled. This facility was fully repaid on 2 August 2012, primarily with proceeds from U.S. commercial paper issuance. A portion of this commercial paper was subsequently refinanced with the $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note described above. As of 30 September 2011, a 4.25% Eurobond for $400.3 maturing in 2012 was classified as long-term debt because of our ability to refinance the debt under our $2,170.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2015 and our intent to refinance via the U.S. or European public or private placement markets. During the first quarter of 2012, we reclassified this Eurobond from long-term debt to current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as we no longer intended to refinance it. The Eurobond was repaid on its maturity date of 10 April 2012, principally from proceeds of commercial paper issuance. During fiscal year 2011, we increased our total multicurrency facility to a total of $2,170.0 maturing on 30 June 2015. Our only financial covenant is a leverage ratio (long-term debt divided by the sum of long-term debt plus equity) of no greater than 60%. As of 30 September 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under these commitments. Effective 11 June 2012, we entered into an offshore Chinese Renminbi (RMB) syndicated credit facility of RMB1,000.0 million ($158.7), maturing in June 2015. There are RMB200.0 million ($31.7) in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at 30 September 2012. Additional commitments totaling $400.0 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $387.0 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2012. We are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. We have classified a 4.15% senior note for $300.0 maturing in 2013 as long-term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under our $2,170.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2015. Our current intent is to refinance this debt via the U.S. public or private placement markets. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2012, .6 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of $53.1. At 30 September 2012, $946.9 in share repurchase authorization remains. 2013 Outlook Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2013, primarily driven by debt maturities. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. Dividends On 15 March 2012, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.58 per share to $.64 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. 33 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2012: Payments Due By Period Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $4,659 $374 $573 $406 $433 $418 $2,455 Contractual interest 632 123 99 85 74 55 196 Capital leases 3 1 1 1 Operating leases 273 60 56 40 28 21 68 Pension obligations 1,247 275 82 84 92 96 618 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,927 780 153 144 143 119 588 Other liabilities 11 11 Total Contractual Obligations $8,752 $1,624 $964 $760 $770 $709 $3,925 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,501 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2012, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2012. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Approximately $800 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. We have a supply agreement for the purchase of silane gas that is not matched to a customer sales contract having terms extending to ten years. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we made an offer to terminate the contract; however, no settlement has been reached. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $592 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2013. 34 We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, we purchase approximately $7.2 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. Other Liabilities We have an obligation to purchase 2% of the remaining shares of Indura S.A. within twelve months of the acquisition date for CLP5.0 billion ($11) based on a multiple of earnings formula, which is reflected in other liabilities at 30 September 2012. This liability was reported in payables and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2012. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2012 were $670.8. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2012 were $110.8. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. Discontinued Operations Other noncurrent liabilities as of 30 September 2012 included $141 for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of our Homecare business. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We did not include this amount in the Contractual Obligations table due to the uncertainty in timing of any payments. Put Options We currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our Air Products San Fu Company, Ltd. and Indura S.A. subsidiaries. The put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing, we excluded the potential payments from the Contractual Obligations table. PENSION BENEFITS We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For 2012, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $3,239.1 from $2,823.7 in 2011. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $4,486.5 and $3,765.5 in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2012 2011 2010 Pension expense $120.4 $114.1 $109.0 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 8.2 1.3 14.8 Weighted average discount rate 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.6 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.2 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.1 % 2012 vs. 2011 Pension expense in 2012, net of special items, was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year. 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions in 2011. Expense in 2011 included $1.3 of special termination and settlement charges. 35 2013 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $175 to $180 in 2013, an increase of $55 to $60 from 2012, resulting primarily from a decline in discount rates. In 2013, pension expense will include approximately $144 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $96.0 in 2012. Net actuarial losses of $358.6 were incurred in 2012, resulting primarily from a 100 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, partially offset by actual asset returns above expected returns. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2013. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. We analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2012 and 2011, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $76.4 and $241.0, respectively. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be approximately $275 in 2013. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 34 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, we are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $44.7, $34.0, and $31.6 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that in 2012 and 2011, we spent approximately $4 and $6, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $4 and $5 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $87 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $101. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2012 and 2011 included an accrual of $87.5 and $82.3, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; Paulsboro, New Jersey; and the Pasadena, Texas locations is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. 36 Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin 1 January 2013. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. We do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. We did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation. While some inflationary pressures existed during the first half of fiscal year 2012, inflation in the U.S. has been modest for several years. In addition, we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates, with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the U.S. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2012 totaled $8,240.6, and depreciation expense totaled $813.7 during 2012. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. 37 Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. We have numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the Equipment and Energy segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years. The depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life By 1 Year Increase Life By 1 Year Merchant Gases $28 $(19 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $20 $(14 ) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from 38 estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $126.4, was $1,724.8 as of 30 September 2012. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Goodwill increased in 2012 primarily as a result of the Indura S.A. acquisition in Merchant Gases. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements. We perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. We have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. We determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. We primarily use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. Our valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2012 totaled $663.9 and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2012 totaled $97.7 and consisted primarily of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually. In addition, these intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. To determine fair value, we utilize an income approach, the royalty savings method. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,175.7 at 30 September 2012. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. 39 In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2012, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $48.5 and $475.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2012 were $110.8, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2012 was $287.3. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $13. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $25 per year. 40 The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns, and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans liabilities and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $15 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.
