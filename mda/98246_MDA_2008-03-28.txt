Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to the fiscal year that ends on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY GROWTH STRATEGIES The Company key growth strategies are: To selectively expand its channels of distribution in important markets around the world without compromising the value of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark; To maintain an active product development program; To increase its control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing; To achieve improved profit margins; To enhance customer awareness through marketing and public relations programs; and To provide superior customer service. 2007 SUMMARY Net sales increased 15% to $2.9 billion due to growth in all channels of distribution. Worldwide comparable store sales increased 7% on a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures). Comparable TIFFANY & CO. store sales in the U.S. increased 7%. Comparable international store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 7% due to growth in most countries. Net earnings rose 20% and net earnings per diluted share rose 22%. Included in net earnings were the following items: The Company entered into a strategic alliance with The Swatch Group, Ltd. which will design, manufacture, distribute and market TIFFANY & CO. brand watches worldwide. As a result of this agreement, management decided to discontinue certain watch models and, accordingly, recorded a pre-tax charge of $19,212,000 within cost of sales. The Company sold and leased back the land and building housing the TIFFANY & CO. Flagship store in Tokyo. The Company received proceeds of $327,537,000 and recorded a pre-tax gain of $105,051,000 as other operating income. The Company contributed $10,000,000 (recorded within selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses) to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, funded with the proceeds from the sale of the Tokyo Flagship store. The Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $15,532,000 associated with its IRIDESSE business within SG&A expenses. The Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $47,981,000 on the note receivable from Tahera Diamond Corporation ( Tahera ) within SG&A expenses. The Company sold 100% of the stock of Little Switzerland, Inc. ( Little Switzerland ) for net proceeds of $32,870,000 and recorded within discontinued operations a pre-tax TIFFANY & CO. K - 30 impairment charge of $54,260,000 due to the sale. The Company sold and leased back the land and building housing the TIFFANY & CO. Flagship store in London and received proceeds of $148,628,000. The Company repurchased 12.4 million shares of its Common Stock. The number of Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores and boutiques increased 10%. The Company added 17 retail locations, net of closings: opening seven in the U.S. and 14 internationally, while closing four locations, one in the U.S. and three in Japan. The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend rate twice for a total increase of 50%. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internally, management monitors its international sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate measure provides a more representative assessment of the sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2007 2006 Constant- Constant- GAAP Translation Exchange- GAAP Translation Exchange- Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 15 % 2 % 13 % 11 % 11 % U.S. Retail 11 % 11 % 9 % 9 % International Retail 19 % 4 % 15 % 12 % (1 )% 13 % Japan Retail 1 % 1 % (1 )% (5 )% 4 % Other Asia-Pacific 39 % 5 % 34 % 25 % 2 % 23 % Europe 31 % 9 % 22 % 28 % 5 % 23 % Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide 8 % 1 % 7 % 6 % (1 )% 7 % U.S. Retail 7 % 7 % 5 % 5 % International Retail 10 % 3 % 7 % 7 % (1 )% 8 % Japan Retail (4 )% 1 % (5 )% (4 )% (4 )% Other Asia-Pacific 31 % 5 % 26 % 24 % 2 % 22 % Europe 22 % 9 % 13 % 25 % 5 % 20 % TIFFANY & CO. K - 31 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Certain operating data as a percentage of net sales were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 44.5 43.7 43.5 Gross profit 55.5 56.3 56.5 Other operating income 3.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 41.0 39.5 39.8 Earnings from continuing operations 18.0 16.8 16.7 Interest expense, financing costs and other income, net 0.2 0.4 0.6 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 17.8 16.4 16.1 Provision for income taxes 6.5 5.9 4.8 Net earnings from continuing operations 11.3 10.5 11.3 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (1.0 ) (0.6 ) (0.3 ) Net earnings 10.3 % 9.9 % 11.0 % Net Sales 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Increase Increase U.S. Retail $ 1,474,637 $ 1,326,441 $ 1,220,683 11 % 9 % International Retail 1,200,442 1,010,627 900,689 19 % 12 % Direct Marketing 182,127 174,078 157,483 5 % 11 % Other 81,565 49,588 33,937 64 % 46 % $ 2,938,771 $ 2,560,734 $ 2,312,792 15 % 11 % Comparable Store Sales. Reference will be made to comparable store sales below. A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan, sales for a new store or boutique are not included if the store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. U.S. Retail . U.S. Retail includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.S., as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products through business-to-business direct selling operations in the U.S. The following table presents the U.S. Retail channel and its components as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2007 2006 2005 New York Flagship store 10 % 10 % 10 % Branch stores 38 % 40 % 41 % Business-to-business 2 % 2 % 2 % 50 % 52 % 53 % TIFFANY & CO. K - 32 U.S. Retail sales increased in 2007 and 2006 as a result of comparable store sales growth of 7% (or $94,451,000) in 2007 and 5% (or $61,885,000) in 2006 and non-comparable store sales growth of $51,478,000 and $41,601,000 in those periods. In 2007 and 2006, the New York Flagship store sales increased 21% and 9% and comparable branch store sales increased 4% in both periods. Total sales growth in both 2007 and 2006 was driven equally by an increase in the average sales amount per transaction and an increase in the number of transactions. Management attributes the increased amount per transaction to sales of higher-priced merchandise. In addition, the New York Flagship store and certain branch stores benefited from higher sales to foreign tourists. In 2007 and 2006, the Company experienced growth across a range of jewelry categories, with especially strong results in jewelry with diamonds. The Company opened seven new U.S. stores and closed one in 2007 and opened five new U.S. stores in 2006. International Retail. International Retail includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores and department store boutiques outside the U.S., as well as business-to-business, Internet and wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. products outside the U.S. The following table presents the sales contribution in U.S. dollars of each geographic region within the International Retail channel as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2007 2006 2005 Japan 17 % 19 % 21 % Other Asia-Pacific 11 % 9 % 8 % Europe 8 % 7 % 6 % Other International 5 % 4 % 4 % 41 % 39 % 39 % International Retail sales increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to comparable store sales growth of 10% (or $88,044,000) in 2007 and 7% (or $57,353,000) in 2006 and non-comparable store sales growth of $78,573,000 and $28,968,000 in those periods. International Retail sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, increased 15% in 2007 and 13% in 2006, and comparable store sales rose 7% in 2007 and 8% in 2006. When compared with the prior year, the weighted-average U.S. dollar exchange rate was weaker in 2007 and stronger in 2006. Japan retail sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, were unchanged in 2007 due to an increase in the average sales amount per unit offset by a decline in the number of units sold, and increased 4% in 2006 due to an increase in unit sales of engagement and other fine jewelry. Comparable store sales declined 5% in 2007 and were unchanged in 2006. Management attributes this performance to a lack of consumer confidence and a stagnant economy. Management will respond by further developing relationships with key customers, introducing new products to the market and enhancing retail locations through renovation, expansion and relocation. Management will consider, if the occasion arises, closing or consolidating certain locations when better locations can be obtained. In 2007, the Company opened four locations in Japan and closed three. In 2006, the Company opened four locations and two were closed. Management closed these locations to enhance the quality of its selling locations in Japan. The Company also launched an e-commerce website in 2005. In the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan, comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 26% in 2007 due to growth in all markets and 22% in 2006 due to growth in most markets. The Company opened six stores in 2007 and three stores (net) in 2006. TIFFANY & CO. K - 33 In Europe, comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 13% in 2007 and 20% in 2006 due to growth in all markets. The United Kingdom represents more than half of European sales. The Company opened three stores in 2007 and one store in 2006. Store Data . Gross square footage of Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores increased 9% to 860,000 in 2007, following a 6% increase to 792,000 in 2006. Sales per gross square foot generated by those stores were $2,890 in 2007, $2,746 in 2006 and $2,666 in 2005. Management objective is to increase sales per square foot by increasing consumer traffic and the conversion rate (the percentage of shoppers who actually purchase). Management intends to increase traffic through more targeted advertising and to improve the conversion rate through continued sales training and customer-focused initiatives. The Company worldwide expansion strategy is to continue to open Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores and boutiques annually. In 2008, the Company expects to add 6 new U.S. stores and approximately 20 international stores. 2008 store openings announced to date for the U.S. are: Los Angeles, California; West Hartford, Connecticut; Columbus, Ohio; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2008, the Company will also open a new store in the Los Angeles market. This store will be the first to employ a new store format. Stores of this format will carry a reduced selection of merchandise in order to concentrate on higher-margin products and will occupy a smaller footprint than Tiffany full-line stores. Management believes that this new format will be highly efficient and will give the Company the opportunity to open stores in affluent, albeit smaller U.S. cities and to better serve larger markets where the Company already operates full-line stores. Anticipation of the success of this format underpins management expanded store opening program for the U.S. For non-U.S. markets, 2008 store openings announced to date are: Perth, Australia; Brussels, Belgium; D sseldorf, Germany; London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom; Madrid, Spain; Shenyang, China; Chengdu, China; Fukuoka, Japan; Osaka, Japan; and Tokyo, Japan. Additional international locations are being planned. Direct Marketing. Direct Marketing includes Internet and catalog sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in the U.S. Direct Marketing sales rose in both 2007 and 2006. In 2007, approximately three quarters of the increase resulted from an increase in the number of orders shipped. In 2006, the increase was evenly divided between a higher number of orders shipped and an increased average order size. Website traffic and orders have continued to increase as consumers have shifted their purchases from catalogs to the Internet. Catalogs remain an effective marketing tool for both retail and Internet sales, but the Company has reduced catalog circulation and in 2006 began e-mail marketing communications to customers. Other. Other includes worldwide sales of businesses operated under trademarks or tradenames other than TIFFANY & CO. A significant portion of sales in this channel are of wholesale diamonds. Wholesale diamond sales are made to divest gemstones that do not meet the Company quality requirements; typically the Company purchases such gemstones in mixed lots which are then culled. Wholesale sales of diamonds increased to $70,407,000 in 2007 from $39,848,000 in 2006 and $26,218,000 in 2005. IRIDESSE store sales (representing 14% of Other sales and less than 1% of net sales in 2007) increased in both years due to store openings, however, performance has been below management expectations. The Company recorded an impairment charge in 2007 associated with Iridesse (see SG&A expenses below). Gross Margin Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) declined in 2007 by 0.8 percentage point and declined in 2006 by 0.2 percentage point. The primary components of the net decline in 2007 were: (i) a 0.7 percentage point decline due to a $19,212,000 charge related to the discontinuance of certain watch TIFFANY & CO. K - 34 models; (ii) a 0.6 percentage point decline due to increased low-margin wholesale sales of diamonds; which was partially offset by (iii) a 0.2 percentage point improvement due to the leverage effect of fixed product-related costs, which includes costs associated with merchandising and distribution. The primary components affecting the net decline in 2006 were: (i) a 0.4 percentage point decline due to increased low-margin wholesale sales of diamonds; and (ii) a 0.4 percentage point improvement due to the leverage effect of fixed product-related costs. In 2007 and 2006, the Company increased its retail prices in response to higher costs of precious metals and diamonds. The Company adjusts its retail prices from time to time to address specific market conditions, product cost increases and longer-term changes in foreign currencies/dollar relationships. In addition, the Company hedging program (see Note I to consolidated financial statements) uses yen put options to stabilize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations of product costs in Japan over the short-term. Beginning with the first quarter of 2007, the Company also has a zero-cost collar hedging program that covers a portion of its platinum and silver needs for internal manufacturing. Management objective is to improve gross margin through greater product manufacturing/sourcing efficiencies (including increased direct rough-diamond sourcing and internal manufacturing), increased use of distribution center capacity, and selective price adjustments to address higher product costs. Other Operating Income In 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for the land and multi-tenant building housing the TIFFANY & CO. Flagship store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. The Company was able to secure a long-term lease and proceed with a renovation of the store and the building exterior. The Company is leasing back that portion of the property that it occupied immediately prior to the transaction. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $105,051,000 and a deferred gain of $75,244,000, which will be amortized in selling, general and administrative expenses over a 15-year period. The pre-tax gain represents the profit on the sale of the property in excess of the present value of the minimum lease payments. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease. The lease expires in 2032; however, the Company has options to terminate the lease in 2022 and 2027 without penalty. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses SG&A expenses increased $194,236,000, or 19%, in 2007 which included the following expenses: $47,981,000 impairment charge on the note receivable from Tahera (see Liquidity and Capital Resources below); $15,532,000 impairment charge for losses in the IRIDESSE business (included in the non-reportable segment Other). In accordance with its policy on impairment of long-lived assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge as a result of lower than expected store performance and a related reduction in future cash flow projections; and $10,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, a private charitable foundation established by the Company. The contribution was made from proceeds received from the sale-leaseback of the land and multi-tenant building housing the TIFFANY & CO. Flagship store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. Excluding the above charges, SG&A expenses increased $120,723,000, or 12%, primarily due to increased labor and benefit costs of $42,136,000 and increased depreciation and store occupancy expenses of $37,805,000 (both of which were largely due to new and existing stores), as well as an increase of TIFFANY & CO. K - 35 $12,287,000 in marketing expenses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 1.5 percentage points to 41.0%. Excluding the above charges, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 1.0 percentage point to 38.5% which resulted from the leverage effect of strong sales growth against fixed costs. SG&A expenses increased $90,601,000, or 10%, in 2006 largely due to increased labor and benefit costs of $31,245,000 and increased depreciation and occupancy expenses of $24,580,000, both of which were largely due to new and existing stores. In addition, marketing expenses increased $25,177,000 which included costs to promote the launch of the Frank Gehry jewelry collection. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by 0.3 percentage point in 2006. Management long-term objective is to improve the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales by controlling expenses wherever feasible and enhancing productivity so that sales growth can generate a higher rate of earnings growth. Earnings from Continuing Operations % of % of % of (in thousands) 2007 Sales* 2006 Sales* 2005 Sales* Earnings (losses) from continuing operations: U.S. Retail $ 288,030 20 % $ 243,258 18 % $ 248,129 20 % International Retail 301,957 25 % 253,835 25 % 211,164 23 % Direct Marketing 62,533 34 % 58,046 33 % 53,681 34 % Other (33,038 ) (41 )% (14,379 ) (29 )% (14,525 ) (43 )% 619,482 540,760 498,449 Unallocated corporate expenses (127,007 ) (4 )% (109,964 ) (4 )% (110,824 ) (5 )% Other operating income 105,051 Other operating expenses (67,193 ) Earnings from continuing operations $ 530,333 $ 430,796 $ 387,625 * Percentages represent earnings (losses) from continuing operations as a percentage of each segment net sales. Reclassifications were made to the prior years earnings (losses) from continuing operations by segment to conform to the current year presentation and to reflect the revised manner in which management evaluates the performance of segments. Effective with the first quarter of 2007, the Company revised certain allocations of operating expenses between unallocated corporate expenses and earnings (losses) from continuing operations for segments. Earnings from continuing operations rose 23% in 2007. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations (before the effect of unallocated corporate expenses, other operating income and interest expense, financing costs and other income, net) to each segment net sales in 2007 compared with 2006 was as follows: U.S. Retail the ratio increased 2 percentage points primarily due to an increase in gross margin (due to the leverage effect of sales growth on fixed product-related costs) and the leverage effect of sales growth on operating expenses; International Retail the ratio was consistent with prior year. Strong sales growth and profitability in most international markets was offset by increased operating expenses (due to TIFFANY & CO. K - 36 increased marketing activity and new stores) and a decline in gross margin (due to changes in sales mix) in Japan; Direct Marketing the ratio increased 1 percentage point primarily due to the leverage effect of sales growth on operating expenses; and Other the loss ratio increased 12 percentage points which was more than entirely driven by the impairment charge associated with the IRIDESSE business. Earnings from continuing operations rose 11% in 2006. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from continuing operations (before the effect of unallocated corporate expenses, other operating income and interest expense, financing costs and other income, net) to each segment net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was as follows: U.S. Retail the ratio decreased 2 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin (due to higher product costs) and increased SG&A expenses (due to new and existing stores as well as increased marketing expenses); International Retail the ratio increased 2 percentage points primarily due to an improved gross margin (due to the leverage effect of sales growth on product-related costs) and the leverage effect of sales growth on operating expenses; Direct Marketing the ratio decreased 1 percentage point primarily due to a decline in gross margin (due to higher product costs); and Other the loss ratio improved 14 percentage points primarily due to increased sales. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for information technology, finance, legal and human resources. Unallocated corporate expenses increased 15% in 2007 partly due to the $10,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased 1% in 2006. Other operating income represents the $105,051,000 pre-tax gain on the sale-leaseback of the land and multi-tenant building housing the TIFFANY & CO. Flagship store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. Other operating expenses include the $47,981,000 impairment charge on the note receivable from Tahera and the $19,212,000 charge related to the discontinuance of certain watch models. Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense decreased $1,345,000 in 2007 primarily due to reduced borrowings under the revolving credit facility and repayments of long-term debt obligations. Interest expense increased $3,174,000 in 2006 primarily due to increased borrowings to support inventory growth and share repurchases. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions, and minority interest income/expense. Other income, net increased $1,012,000 in 2007. Other income, net increased $7,257,000 in 2006 due to (i) $6,774,000 of gains associated with the sale of equity investments and marketable securities; (ii) increased interest income; partially offset by (iii) a change of $3,794,000 in foreign currency transaction gains/losses. TIFFANY & CO. K - 37 Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 36.6% in 2007, compared with 36.1% in 2006 and 30.2% in 2005. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 primarily reflected tax benefits associated with the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( AJCA ). The AJCA, which was signed into law on October 22, 2004, created a temporary incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The incentive effectively reduced the amount of U.S. Federal income tax due on repatriation. Taking advantage of the AJCA, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $22,588,000 in 2005 associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The tax benefit to the Company occurred because the Company had previously accrued income taxes on un-repatriated foreign earnings at statutory tax rates. In total, the Company repatriated $178,245,000 of accumulated foreign earnings. Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax Management concluded that Little Switzerland operations did not demonstrate the potential to generate a return on investment consistent with management objectives and, therefore, during the second quarter of 2007 the Company Board of Directors authorized the sale of Little Switzerland. On July 31, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with NXP Corporation ( NXP ) by which NXP would purchase 100% of the stock of Little Switzerland. The results of Little Switzerland are presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Prior to the reclassification, Little Switzerland results had been included within the non-reportable segment Other (see Note C to consolidated financial statements). The loss from discontinued operations in 2007 included a pre-tax impairment charge of $54,260,000 due to the sale of Little Switzerland. The loss from discontinued operations in 2006 included a pre-tax charge of $6,893,000 related to the impairment of goodwill for the Little Switzerland business as a result of store performance and cash flow projections. 2008 Outlook Management financial performance objectives for 2008 are based on the following assumptions and should be read in conjunction with Item 1A Risk Factors on page K-20. In addition, these objectives reflect the Company decision to change its inventory valuation method from LIFO to average cost beginning in the first quarter of 2008 (see Note R to consolidated financial statements). Net sales growth of approximately 10% reflecting a near-term cautious outlook for the U.S. and continued strong growth in most international markets. Management outlook reflects the view that the U.S. economy will remain weak through the first half of 2008 and that U.S. consumer confidence will continue to reflect conditions observed during the last quarter of 2007. The net sales growth objective is composed of (i) a high-single-digit percentage increase in U.S. Retail sales, reflecting a low-single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales and the planned opening of six stores; (ii) a mid-teens percentage increase in International Retail sales, which reflects a mid-single-digit percentage increase in comparable store sales (on a constant-exchange-rate basis) and the opening of approximately 20 stores and boutiques (net of closings); (iii) a mid- TIFFANY & CO. K - 38 single-digit percentage increase in Direct Marketing sales; and (iv) a low-single-digit percentage increase in Other sales. Operating margin approximately equal to the prior year. Other expenses, net of approximately $20 million. An effective tax rate of 36% 37%. Net earnings per diluted share of $2.75 $2.85. Net inventories increasing by a high-single-digit percentage. Capital expenditures of approximately $200 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders equity was 28% and 29% at January 31, 2008 and 2007. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 391,395 $ 239,036 $ 268,458 Investing activities 335,170 (197,137 ) 40,820 Financing activities (664,408 ) (248,871 ) (85,151 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 15,610 3,162 (3,555 ) Net cash used in discontinued operations (7,616 ) (13,296 ) (14,644 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 70,151 $ (217,106 ) $ 205,928 Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $391,395,000 in 2007, $239,036,000 in 2006 and $268,458,000 in 2005. The increase in 2007 from 2006 primarily resulted from increased net earnings from continuing operations and smaller growth in inventories. Taxes payable also increased in 2007 due to the increase in net earnings. The decrease in 2006 from 2005 resulted from higher inventory purchases, partly offset by increased net earnings after adjustment for non-cash items and lower payments for taxes made in 2006 (in 2005, payments for taxes were higher due to the gain on the sale of an equity investment in 2004). Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $1,258,706,000 and 3.2 at January 31, 2008, compared with $1,253,973,000 and 3.8 at January 31, 2007. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2008 were 17% higher than January 31, 2007 primarily due to sales growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased accounts receivable, less TIFFANY & CO. K - 39 allowances, by 5% compared to January 31, 2007. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 18 times in both 2007 and 2006. Inventories, net at January 31, 2008 were 8% above January 31, 2007. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories increased 15% due to expanded diamond sourcing operations, as well as higher precious metal costs. Finished goods inventories increased 5% reflecting store openings, broadened product assortments and higher costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased inventories, net by 4% compared to January 31, 2007. Investing Activities The Company had a net cash inflow from investing activities of $335,170,000 in 2007, a net cash outflow of $197,137,000 in 2006 and a net cash inflow of $40,820,000 in 2005. Investing activities in 2007 included proceeds from the sale of assets. Investing activities in 2005 included higher net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments and proceeds from the sale of assets. Proceeds from Sale of Assets. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for the land and multi-tenant building housing the TIFFANY & CO. Flagship store in Tokyo Ginza shopping district. The Company received proceeds of $327,537,000 ( 38,050,000,000) (see Other Operating Income above for more information). In the third quarter of 2007, the Company received net proceeds of $32,870,000 associated with the sale of Little Switzerland. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for the building housing the TIFFANY & CO. Flagship store in London. Following the renovation of the store, the Company was able to secure a long-term lease and, therefore, determined that ownership of the property was no longer strategically necessary. The Company sold the building for proceeds of $148,628,000 ( 73,000,000) and simultaneously entered into a 15-year lease with two 10-year renewal options. The transaction resulted in a deferred gain of $63,961,000, which will be amortized in SG&A expenses over a 15-year period. The Company continues to occupy the entire building and the lease is accounted for as an operating lease. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for its Retail Service Center, a distribution and administrative office facility. The Company received proceeds of $75,000,000 resulting in a gain of $5,300,000, which has been deferred and is being amortized over the lease term. The lease has been accounted for as an operating lease. The lease expires in 2025 and has two ten-year renewal options. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $185,608,000 in 2007, $174,551,000 in 2006 and $148,159,000 in 2005, representing 6%, 7% and 6% of net sales in those respective years. In all three years, expenditures were primarily related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution facilities and ongoing investments in new systems. Management expects that capital expenditures in future years will continue at a rate of approximately 6% 7% of net sales. In 2002, the Company acquired the property housing its Flagship store on Old Bond Street in London and an adjacent building, in order to renovate and reconfigure the interior retail selling space. Construction commenced in 2004 and was completed in 2006 at a cost of approximately $36,000,000. In 2000, the Company began a multi-year project to renovate and reconfigure its New York Flagship store in order to increase the total sales area by approximately 25% and to provide additional space for customer service, customer hospitality and special exhibitions. The increase in the sales area was TIFFANY & CO. K - 40 completed in 2001 when the renovated second floor opened to provide an expanded presentation of engagement and other jewelry. Additional floors were renovated in 2002 to 2005 and the Company completed the project in 2006 with the renovation of the main floor, for a total cost of approximately $110,000,000. Acquisitions. In October 2005, the Company acquired a corporation that specializes in polishing small carat weight diamonds. The price paid by the Company for the entire equity interest in this corporation was $2,000,000, of which $1,200,000 was paid in 2005, $400,000 in 2006 and $400,000 in 2007. This acquisition was strategically important to the Company diamond sourcing program, but not significant to the Company financial position, earnings or cash flows. The Company made a $10,000,000 investment ($4,500,000 in 2004 and $5,500,000 in 2005) in a joint venture that owns and operates a diamond polishing facility. The Company interest in, and control over, this venture are such that its results are consolidated with those of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company expects, through its investment, to gain access to additional supplies of diamonds that meet its quality standards. Marketable Securities. The Company invests excess cash in short-term investments and marketable securities. The Company had (net purchases of) or net proceeds from investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of $13,182,000, ($13,063,000) and $147,994,000 during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $664,408,000 in 2007, $248,871,000 in 2006 and $85,151,000 in 2005, largely reflecting increased share repurchases. Dividends. Cash dividends have been increased for five consecutive years, and twice in 2007. The quarterly dividend rate has increased from $0.06 per share at the beginning of 2005 to a rate of $0.15 per share at the end of 2007. Cash dividends paid were $69,921,000 in 2007, $52,611,000 in 2006 and $42,903,000 in 2005. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 23% in 2007, 21% in 2006 and 17% in 2005. Stock Repurchases. In January 2008, the Company Board of Directors amended the existing share repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program to January 2011 and to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional $500,000,000 of the Company Common Stock. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as price and other market conditions. The Company stock repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2007 2006 2005 Cost of repurchases $ 574,608 $ 281,176 $ 132,816 Shares repurchased and retired 12,374 8,149 3,835 Average cost per share $ 46.44 $ 34.50 $ 34.63 At January 31, 2008, there remained $620,806,000 of authorization for future repurchases. At least annually, the Company Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flow and capital requirements. TIFFANY & CO. K - 41 Recent Borrowings. The Company current sources of working capital are internally-generated cash flows and borrowings available under a revolving credit facility. In July 2005, the Company entered into a $300,000,000 revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ) and, in October 2006, exercised its option to increase the Credit Facility by $150,000,000 to $450,000,000. The Company has the option to increase such commitments to $500,000,000. The Credit Facility is available for working capital and other corporate purposes and contains covenants that require maintenance of certain debt/equity and interest-coverage ratios, in addition to other requirements customary to loan facilities of this nature. Borrowings may be made from eight participating banks and are at interest rates based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin that fluctuates with the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. There was $40,695,000 and $106,681,000 outstanding under the Credit Facility at January 31, 2008 and 2007. The weighted-average interest rate at January 31, 2008 and 2007 was 4.58% and 2.44%. The Credit Facility expires in July 2010. In January 2006, the Company borrowed HKD 300,000,000 ($38,672,000 at issuance) ( Hong Kong Term Loan ), SGD 13,100,000 ($8,043,000 at issuance) ( Singapore Term Loan ) and CHF 19,500,000 ($15,145,000 at issuance) ( Switzerland Term Loan ) due in January 2011. These funds were used to partially finance the repatriation of dividends related to the AJCA (see Provision for Income Taxes above). Principal payments of 10% of the original principal amount are due each year, with the balance due upon maturity. Amounts may be prepaid without incurring penalties. The covenants of the term loans are similar to the Credit Facility. Interest rates are based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin that fluctuates with the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. In 2006, the Singapore Term Loan was paid in full with existing funds. The interest rates for the Hong Kong Term Loan and the Switzerland Term Loan were 3.96% and 3.09%, respectively, at January 31, 2008 and 4.28% and 2.40%, respectively, at January 31, 2007. At January 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2008: (in thousands) Total 2008 2009-2010 2011-2012 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 1,024,539 $ 114,078 $ 210,238 $ 176,614 $ 523,609 Inventory purchase obligations 403,571 153,571 100,000 100,000 50,000 Interest on debt and interest-rate swap agreements a 43,106 16,519 21,651 4,936 Construction-in-progress 16,047 16,047 Non-inventory purchase obligations 9,946 9,946 Other contractual obligations b 12,473 9,258 2,185 1,015 15 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 44,032 44,032 Long-term debt 409,105 65,640 232,479 110,986 $ 1,962,819 $ 429,091 $ 566,553 $ 393,551 $ 573,624 a) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. Variable-rate interest TIFFANY & CO. K - 42 payments were estimated based on rates at January 31, 2008. Actual payments will differ based on changes in interest rates. b) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of royalty and maintenance commitments. The summary above does not include cash contributions for the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $15,000,000 to the pension plan in 2008. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $955,000 in 2008. The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN No. 48 ) on February 1, 2007. During 2007, the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $1,812,000 to $30,306,000. Accrued interest and penalties during 2007 was reduced by $4,649,000 to $3,395,000. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax law or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Ongoing audits are in various stages of completion and, while the Company does not anticipate any material changes in unrecognized income tax benefits over the next 12 months, future developments in the audit process may result in a change in this assessment. The following is a summary of the Company outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Credit Facility and other lines of credit at January 31, 2008: Total Borrowings Available (in thousands) capacity outstanding capacity Credit Facility* $ 450,000 $ 40,695 $ 409,305 Other lines of credit 9,206 3,337 5,869 $ 459,206 $ 44,032 $ 415,174 * This facility matures in July 2010 and the capacity may be increased to $500,000,000. In addition, the Company had letters of credit and financial guarantees of $20,139,000 at January 31, 2008, of which $19,305,000 expires within one year. The Company is party to a CDN$35,000,000 ($35,423,000 at January 31, 2008) credit facility and a CDN$8,000,000 ($8,097,000 at January 31, 2008) working capital loan commitment (collectively the Commitment ) to Tahera, a Canadian diamond mining and exploration company. At January 31, 2008 the Commitment was fully funded and no further amounts remain available to Tahera. In consideration of the Commitment, the Company was granted the right to purchase or market all diamonds mined at the Jericho mine. This mine has been developed and constructed by Tahera in Nunavut, Canada (the Project ). Indebtedness under the Commitment is secured by certain assets of the Project. Although the Project has been operational, Tahera has continued to experience financial losses as a result of production problems, appreciation of the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. Dollar, the rise of oil prices and other costs relative to diamond prices. Due to the financial difficulties, Tahera sought additional financing in the fourth quarter of 2007 in order to meet its cash flow requirements, but was not successful. In January 2008, Tahera filed for protection from creditors pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada. Tahera is continuing to pursue financing and strategic alternatives, but it has not shown indications of possible success to-date and the Project operations TIFFANY & CO. K - 43 have had to cease and be placed in care and maintenance mode. As a result of these events, the Company management has determined that collectibility of the outstanding Commitment is not probable. Therefore, the Company has recorded an impairment charge of $47,981,000, within SG&A expenses, for the full amount outstanding including accrued interest under the Commitment. Based on the Company financial position at January 31, 2008, management anticipates that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows and the funds available under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to support the Company planned worldwide business expansion, share repurchases, debt service and seasonal working capital increases for the foreseeable future. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing at least one-third of annual net sales and approximately one-half of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records the effect of any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2008, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $4,201,000 in inventory and cost of sales. The Company U.S. and foreign branch inventories, excluding Japan, are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, and inventories held by foreign subsidiaries and Japan are valued using the average cost method. Fluctuation in inventory levels, along with the costs of raw materials, could affect the carrying value of the Company inventory. Beginning in the first quarter of 2008, the Company will change its inventory valuation method for the U.S. and foreign branches from LIFO to average cost (see Note R to consolidated financial statements). Long-lived assets . The Company long-lived assets are primarily property, plant and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company recorded impairment charges of $15,532,000 TIFFANY & CO. K - 44 in 2007 and did not record any impairment charges in 2006 or 2005 (see Note B to consolidated financial statements). Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The Company recorded impairment charges of $6,893,000 in 2006 within loss from discontinued operations (see Note C to consolidated financial statements). The 2007 and 2005 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Income taxes . Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in accordance with FIN No. 48. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. The Company also records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for current and retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used a discount rate of 6.00% to determine its 2007 pension and postretirement expense for all U.S. plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2007 pension and postretirement expenses by $3,893,000 and $197,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2007 pension and postretirement expenses by $4,270,000 and $230,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2007 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2007 pension expense by $913,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, the following annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2008: 9.00% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 10.00% (for post-age 65 retirees). The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.00% by 2016 (for pre-age 65 TIFFANY & CO. K - 45 retirees) and by 2018 (for post-age 65 retirees) and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would have increased the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2007 postretirement expense by $28,000. Decreasing the assumed health-care cost trend rate by one-percentage-point would have decreased the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2007 postretirement expense by $25,000. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note B to consolidated financial statements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
