Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2015 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2015 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Introduction We are a leading managed care company, headquartered in Tampa, Florida, focusing exclusively on government-sponsored managed care services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage ("MA") and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans ("PDP") to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs. As of December 31, 2015 , we served approximately 3.8 million members in 49 states and the District of Columbia. We estimate that we are among the largest managed care organizations providing Medicaid managed care services plans, MA plans and PDPs, all as measured by membership. We believe that our broad range of experience and government focus allows us to effectively serve our members, partner with our providers, government clients and communities we serve, and efficiently manage our ongoing operations. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Summarized below are the key financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2015 . For additional information, refer to the "Results of Operations" section, which discusses both consolidated and segment results in more detail. Membership decreased 8.5% in 2015, mainly driven by a decline in PDP membership due to our bid positioning for the 2015 plan year, as well as a decline in our Medicare Health Plans membership due to bid actions, market withdrawals and the divestiture of our Medicare Supplement business. Medicaid Health Plans membership increased 78,000 , or 3.4% year-over-year, primarily from organic growth in our Florida and Kentucky plans. Premiums increased $959.3 million , or 7.4% , in 2015, reflecting organic membership growth in our Medicaid Health Plans segment, primarily Florida and Kentucky, and increased ACA industry fee reimbursement from our Medicaid customers, partially offset by the effect of lower membership in our Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs segments. Net Income increased $54.9 million , or 86.2% , in 2015 primarily attributable to improved performance in all segments, due to our bid positioning for the 2015 plan year, organic growth in our Medicaid membership and improved pharmacy rebates management, partially offset by the increase in ACA industry fee expense for 2015. Key Developments and Accomplishments Our current business strategy is achieved by focusing on care management, local markets and community advocacy, regulatory and provider partnerships and delivering prudent, profitable long-term growth. See Part I, Item 1 Business for further discussion of our business strategy. Presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our business strategy that occurred or affected results of operations, financial condition and cash flows during 2015 , or occurred in 2016 prior to the filing of this 2015 Form 10-K. In January 2016, we entered into a new $850.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing and terminating the previous senior unsecured credit facility. Upon closing, through a combination of $100.0 million in cash and $200.0 million borrowed as a revolving loan under the new credit facility, we repaid in full the $300.0 million term loan due in September 2016 (the "Term Loan") under the previous credit facility. 52 Table of Contents In January 2016, we received a notice that the Georgia Department of Community Health ( Georgia DCH ) intends to extend our current Georgia Medicaid contract, which currently expires on June 30, 2016, for up to twelve months through the addition of two six-month renewal periods. At this time, Georgia DCH anticipates extending the contract at least through December 31, 2016. In September 2015, we received a Notice of Intent to Award ("NOIA") a contract from Georgia DCH to continue serving Medicaid members in Georgia. Services under the new contract are expected to commence on January 1, 2017, with an initial six-month term and five additional one-year renewal options at Georgia DCH's discretion. Three other plans also received a NOIA, which will increase the total number of participating plans from three to four. As of December 31, 2015 , we served approximately 585,000 Medicaid members in Georgia. In November 2015, the New York Department of Health approved the expansion of our New York Medicaid Managed Care and Child Health Plus programs into five new counties effective November 3, 2015. In May 2015, we announced that the New York State Department of Health renewed our contract to continue serving New York Medicaid Managed Care program in eleven counties retroactively effective March 1, 2014. The new contract runs through February 2019. As of December 31, 2015 , we served approximately 122,000 Medicaid members in New York. In September 2015, we achieved accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA") for our Medicaid health plan in South Carolina. Based on the outcome of our 2016 Medicare PDP bids, our plans are below the benchmarks in 17 of the 34 CMS regions and within the de minimus range of the benchmark in nine other regions. Comparatively, in 2015, our plans were below the benchmark in 13 of the 33 regions where we submitted bids and within the de minimus range in nine other regions. In July 2015, we divested Sterling Life Insurance Company ("Sterling"), our Medicare Supplement business that we acquired as part of the Windsor Health Group, Inc. ("Windsor") transaction in January 2014. The Sterling transaction closed on July 1, 2015 and did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position. In June 2015, our Kentucky Medicaid plan was selected by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services to continue serving the Commonwealth's Medicaid Managed Care program in all eight of the program's regions. The new contract, which included a rate decrease, commenced on July 1, 2015 and is for one year. The new contract can be renewed for up to four additional one-year terms upon the mutual agreement of the parties, potentially extending it through June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2015 , we served approximately 440,000 Medicaid members in Kentucky. In June 2015, we completed the offering and sale of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% unsecured senior notes due 2020 (the "Senior Notes") pursuant to a reopening of our existing series of such notes. We received net proceeds of $308.9 million from the issuance, which we are using for general corporate purposes, including organic growth and working capital. In May 2015, our Staywell Health Plan was selected by the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation ("FHKC") to continue providing managed care services for children as part of the Florida Healthy Kids program in nine regions. These regions include the Pensacola, Tallahassee, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers and Miami metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2015 , we served approximately 55,000 Florida Healthy Kids members. The contract commenced on October 1, 2015 and is for a term of two years, which may be extended for two additional one-year terms at FHKC discretion. In March 2015, our Missouri Care, Incorporated ("Missouri Care") health plan was selected to continue serving Medicaid recipients participating in the MO HealthNet Managed Care program. The new contract commenced on July 1, 2015 and is for one year with two renewal options. As of December 31, 2015 , Missouri Care served approximately 114,000 MO HealthNet Managed Care Medicaid members. We have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the 2015 ACA industry fee attributable to the Medicaid programs in these states, including the related state and federal income tax gross-ups. General Economic Environment, Political Environment and Health Care Reform Please refer to Part I, Item 1 Business, General Economic and Political Environment Affecting our Business and Health Care Reform for a further discussion of the current economic and political environment that is affecting our business, 53 Table of Contents including discussion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA") and its potential effect on our business. Refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows . In October 2015, we signed a contract with the Iowa Department of Human Services ("DHS") to serve Iowa Medicaid Managed Care program statewide effective January 1, 2016. In December 2015, CMS delayed the implementation of Iowa's Medicaid Managed Care program until March 1, 2016. Additionally, in December 2015, Iowa's Department of Administrative Services ruled to exclude the Company from participating in Iowa's Medicaid Managed Care program, which the Company disputes and is currently appealing. Accordingly, in 2015, the Company's selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses include non-recurring expenses of $11.9 million related to the readiness costs, certain wind-down costs of WellCare's Iowa operations and certain legal costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results The following table sets forth condensed data from our consolidated statements of operations data, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussions for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Revenues: (Dollars in millions) Premium $ 13,874.8 $ 12,915.5 $ 9,509.1 Investment and other income 15.4 44.4 18.8 Total revenues 13,890.2 12,959.9 9,527.9 Expenses: Medical benefits 11,978.5 11,455.2 8,258.6 Selling, general and administrative 1,132.9 1,018.8 856.5 ACA industry fee 227.3 137.7 Medicaid premium taxes 94.7 76.5 75.7 Depreciation and amortization 72.6 59.9 44.1 Interest 54.2 39.4 11.9 Impairment and other charges 24.1 Gain on divestiture of business (6.1 ) Total expenses 13,554.1 12,811.6 9,246.8 Income from operations 336.1 148.3 281.1 Bargain purchase gain 29.5 Loss on extinguishment of debt (2.8 ) Income before income taxes 336.1 177.8 278.3 Income tax expense 217.5 114.1 103.0 Net income $ 118.6 $ 63.7 $ 175.3 Membership by Segment Medicaid Health Plans 2,388,000 2,310,000 1,759,000 Medicare Health Plans 354,000 417,000 290,000 Medicare PDPs 1,025,000 1,392,000 797,000 Total 3,767,000 4,119,000 2,846,000 54 Table of Contents Membership 2015 vs. 2014 Membership decreased 8.5% in 2015, mainly driven by membership declines in our Medicare PDPs and Medicare Health Plans segments due to our Medicare bid positioning for the 2015 plan year, partially offset by organic membership growth within our Medicaid Health Plans segment. Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Membership increased by 78,000 , or 3.4% , compared to December 31, 2014, primarily driven by organic growth in the Florida, Kentucky and Missouri programs, partially offset by a decrease in membership in our Georgia Medicaid market due to statewide eligibility recertifications. Medicare Health Plans. Membership decreased by 63,000 , or 15.1% , compared to December 31, 2014. The decrease is due to a reduction in our California and New York Medicare membership due to bid actions and county withdrawals in 2015, as well as our exit from the Arizona, Missouri and Ohio MA markets. The reduction also reflects the divestiture of our Medicare Supplement business, which was completed on July 1, 2015. These decreases are partially offset by organic membership growth in Florida and Texas. Medicare PDPs. Membership decreased by 367,000 , or 26.4% , compared to December 31, 2014 . The decrease was primarily due to bid positioning for the 2015 plan year, in which our plans were below the benchmarks in 13 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids and in the de minimis range in nine regions compared to our 2014 bids, in which we were below the benchmark in 30 out of 33 regions, and in the de minimis range in two other regions. PDP members who had been auto-assigned to us in 2014 in regions where our plans were not below or within the de minimis range for 2015 were assigned to other plans effective January 1, 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 At December 31, 2014 , our total membership increased by 1,273,000 , or 44.7% , compared to December 31, 2013 . The growth in 2014 was mainly driven by organic membership growth across all of our segments, primarily in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare PDPs segments, as well as the Windsor acquisition, which was completed on January 1, 2014. Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Membership increased by approximately 551,000 compared to December 31, 2013, primarily driven by organic membership growth in our Florida, Georgia and Kentucky Medicaid programs. Florida membership increased mainly due to our participation in the Managed Medical Assistance ("MMA") program, which commenced implementation on May 1, 2014, while Kentucky membership increased mainly due to Kentucky's participation in the 2014 Medicaid expansion. Additionally, 42,000 members were transferred to our Medicaid plan in New Jersey as a result of the Healthfirst Health Plans of New Jersey, Inc., ("Healthfirst NJ") acquisition. Medicare Health Plans. Membership increased approximately 127,000 compared to December 31, 2013, primarily from the Windsor acquisition, which contributed approximately 37,000 MA and 43,000 Medicare Supplement program members as of December 31, 2014, as well as an increase resulting from the 2014 annual election period due to increased dual-eligible beneficiaries and expansions into new counties. Medicare PDPs. Membership increased approximately 595,000 compared to December 31, 2013 as a result of the outcome of our 2014 bids, as well as the inclusion of membership from the Windsor acquisition, which accounted for 103,000 members. Net income 2015 vs. 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our net income increased by $54.9 million , or 86.2% , compared to the same period of 2014, primarily attributable to improved performance in all segments, due to our Medicare bid positioning for the 2015 plan year, organic growth in our Medicaid membership and improved pharmacy rebates management, partially offset by the increase in unreimbursed ACA industry fee expense for 2015. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of current developments, operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. 55 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 For the year ended December 31, 2014, our net income decreased by $111.6 million, or 63.7%, compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to higher medical benefits ratios ("MBR") in all of our segments, the effect of unreimbursed ACA industry fees, increased interest expense from higher debt levels in 2014 and the recognition of $24.1 million in impairment and other charges, primarily related to the partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in the 2012 acquisition of Easy Choice Health Plan, Inc. ( Easy Choice ). These decreases were partially offset by the increase in premiums from organic membership growth and acquisitions, lower administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and the Windsor bargain purchase gain. Premium revenue 2015 vs. 2014 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $959.3 million , or 7.4% , compared to the same period in 2014, reflecting higher membership in our Medicaid Health Plans segment, primarily from organic growth in Florida, Kentucky, and Illinois and increased ACA industry fee reimbursement from our Medicaid customers. These increases were partially offset by lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment resulting from the bid positioning taken for the 2015 plan year, as well as the divestiture of our Medicare Supplement business effective July 1, 2015. The increase in premium revenue in 2015 also reflects a full year of premiums related to the Healthfirst acquisition, which was completed on July 1, 2014. 2014 vs. 2013 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $3.4 billion, or 35.8%, compared to the same period in 2013, due mainly to the effect of organic membership growth across all of our segments and the Windsor acquisition, which accounted for a combined increase in Medicare Health Plans and Medicaid PDPs segment revenue of $620.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, the increase was due to the effect of the ACA fee reimbursement from our Medicaid state customers, the favorable effect of Medicaid membership mix changes and the benefit of a full year of premiums for our South Carolina and Missouri Medicaid plans that were acquired in the first quarter of 2013. These increases were partially offset by rate decreases in our Medicare Health Plans segment and a lower rate in our Medicare PDPs segment, consistent with our 2014 bids. Medical benefits expense 2015 vs. 2014 Total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $523.3 million , or 4.6% , compared with the same period in 2014 , primarily due to the increased Medicaid membership. The increase was partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development of $78.1 million recognized in 2015, compared with unfavorable prior year development of $48.1 million recognized in 2014, and lower membership in our Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs segments resulting from our 2015 bid positioning. The increase in medical benefits expense for 2015 also reflects a full year of expense related to our Healthfirst NJ acquisition. 2014 vs. 2013 Total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 billion, or 38.7%, compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to increased membership across all our segments, and higher current period medical and pharmacy costs, including higher medical costs associated with the implementation of the Florida MMA program, which operated at an MBR that was higher than our 2013 performance in the state. Also contributing to the higher expense was unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2014, which was due to higher than expected medical services in our Medicaid and Medicare Health Plan segments that were not discernible until the effect became clearer over time as claim payments were processed. For the year ended December 31, 2014, medical benefits expense was affected by approximately $48.1 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development compared to $3.0 million of favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2013. 56 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense SG&A expense includes aggregate costs related to the resolution of the previously disclosed governmental investigations and related litigation, such as settlement accruals and related fair value accretion, legal fees and other similar costs ("investigation costs"). Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these costs. SG&A expense also includes certain costs relating to the divestiture of Sterling ("Sterling divestiture costs"), transitory costs related to our decision to change our pharmacy claims processing to a new pharmacy benefit manager ("PBM") effective January 1, 2016 ("PBM transitory costs") and non-recurring Iowa SG&A costs relating to readiness costs, certain wind-down costs of WellCare's Iowa operations and certain legal costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 ("Iowa SG&A costs"). We believe it is appropriate to evaluate SG&A expense exclusive of these costs as we do not consider them to be indicative of long-term business operations. A reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding such costs, is presented below. For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 1,132.9 $ 1,018.8 $ 856.5 Adjustments: Investigation costs (30.4 ) (37.6 ) (57.3 ) Sterling divestiture costs (2.0 ) PBM transitory costs (18.1 ) Iowa SG&A costs (11.9 ) Adjusted SG&A Expense $ 1,070.5 $ 981.2 $ 799.2 SG&A ratio (1) 8.2 % 7.9 % 9.1 % Adjusted SG&A ratio (2) 7.9 % 7.7 % 8.5 % (1) SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue. (2) Adjusted SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements. 2015 vs. 2014 Our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $114.1 million , or 11.2% , compared to the same period in 2014 . Our Adjusted SG&A expense for year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $89.3 million , or 9.1% , compared to the same period in 2014 . The increase was primarily due to normal operating costs associated with the 2015 growth in Medicaid membership, continued investments in our medical cost initiatives and the effect of lower compensation expense in 2014 resulting from lower management incentive compensation. The increases were partially offset by lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment and continued improvements in operating efficiency. Our SG&A ratio and Adjusted SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the same period in 2014 , primarily reflecting lower compensation expense in 2014 related to lower management incentive compensation, partially offset by continued improvements in operating efficiency in 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 Our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $162.3 million , or 18.9% , compared to the same period in 2013. Our Adjusted SG&A expense for year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $182.0 million , or 22.8% compared to the same period in 2013. SG&A expense increased primarily due to the growth in membership, investments in technology and infrastructure, including costs necessary to meet regulatory changes, investments related to our medical cost initiatives, increased spending related to the integration of recent acquisitions and our other growth and service initiatives. These cost increases were partially offset by improvements in operating efficiency and lower compensation expense in 2014 resulting from lower management incentive compensation. Our SG&A ratio and Adjusted SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased compared to the same period 57 Table of Contents in 2013, primarily due to the improvements in operating efficiency and lower management incentive compensation discussed above. ACA Industry Fee 2015 vs. 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the ACA industry fee increased approximately $89.6 million compared to the same period in 2014. The higher expense is due to the increased total fee levied on the industry, from $8 billion in 2014 to $11.3 billion in 2015, and the increase in our share of total industry premiums for 2014. The ACA industry fee was first required by law in 2014 and is non-deductible for income tax purposes. As discussed in Key Developments and Accomplishments , we have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the 2015 ACA industry fee attributable to the Medicaid programs in these states, including the related state and federal income tax gross-ups. Interest expense 2015 vs. 2014 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $14.8 million compared to the same period in 2014, primarily driven by the higher average debt levels during 2015, resulting from the issuance of the Term Loan in September 2014 and the additional $300.0 million issuance of Senior Notes in June 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $27.5 million compared to 2013, primarily driven by higher average debt levels during 2014 due to the Term Loan funded in September 2014 and the initial issuance of $600 million of the Senior Notes in November 2013. Impairment and other charges During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $24.1 million in impairment and other charges. This primarily relates to the $18.0 million partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of Easy Choice as well as the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the purchase of certain assets from a small health plan in 2012. Lastly, the charges also included the resolution of certain matters related to the purchase price of our 2013 acquisitions. We were no longer able to recognize such charges as adjustments to acquired assets since we were beyond the measurement period established in the accounting rules for business combinations. Gain on Divestiture of Business During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $6.1 million pre-tax gain resulting from the July 2015 divestiture of Sterling. Bargain Purchase Gain As a result of the Windsor acquisition on January 1, 2014, we recognized a bargain purchase gain of approximately $29.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, as the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired exceeded the total consideration paid or payable to the seller. After consideration of all relevant factors, we concluded that the excess fair value constituted a bargain purchase gain in accordance with accounting rules related to business combinations. Income tax expense 2015 vs. 2014 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $217.5 million , or 64.7% of pre-tax income, compared to $114.1 million , or 64.2% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The higher 2015 income tax expense is a result of higher income before income taxes as the effective tax rate is consistent as compared to the prior year. 58 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $114.1 million, or 64.2% of pre-tax income, compared to $103.0 million, or 37.0% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2013. The higher 2014 effective rate mainly reflected the effect of the non-deductible ACA industry fee. Additionally, the effective rate was lower in 2013 due to an issue resolution agreement reached with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of the investigation-related costs, resulting in approximately $7.6 million in additional tax benefit over what was recorded as of December 31, 2012. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by the favorable effect of the Windsor bargain purchase gain. Segment Reporting Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the enterprise's chief operating decision maker to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Accordingly, we have three reportable segments: Medicaid Health Plans, Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs. Segment Financial Performance Measures Our primary measurements of profitability for our reportable segments are premium revenue, gross margin and MBR. Gross margin is defined as premium revenue less medical benefits expense, less ACA industry fees. MBR measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement. We use gross margin and MBR to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense. These metrics are utilized to make various business decisions, including which health care plans to offer, quality improvement initiatives to implement, geographic areas to enter or exit and health care providers to include in our networks. For further information regarding premium revenues and medical benefits expense, please refer below to " Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable " and " Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable " under " Critical Accounting Estimates. " Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our income from operations (before income taxes), as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Gross Margin: (In millions) Medicaid Health Plans $ 1,072.4 $ 839.2 $ 733.8 Medicare Health Plans 428.4 411.6 411.5 Medicare PDPs 168.2 71.8 105.2 Total gross margin 1,669.0 1,322.6 1,250.5 Investment and other income 15.4 44.4 18.8 Other expenses (1) (1,348.3 ) (1,218.7 ) (988.2 ) Income from operations $ 336.1 $ 148.3 $ 281.1 (1) Other expenses includes selling, general and administrative expenses, Medicaid Premium taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest and impairment and other charges. 59 Table of Contents Medicaid Health Plans Our Medicaid Health Plans segment includes plans for beneficiaries of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ("TANF"), Supplemental Security Income ("SSI"), Aged Blind and Disabled ("ABD") and other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP") and Managed Long-Term Care ("MLTC") programs, including long-term services and supports. As of December 31, 2015, we operated Medicaid health plans in Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. We began serving South Carolina members on February 1, 2013, Missouri Care members on April 1, 2013 and New Jersey members on January 1, 2014. As of July 1, 2013, we no longer provided Medicaid services in Ohio. Medicaid Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicaid segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement (1) $ 8,760.4 $ 7,572.8 $ 5,585.5 Medicaid premium taxes (1) 94.7 76.5 75.7 Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement (1) 219.2 124.6 Premium revenue 9,074.3 7,773.9 5,661.2 Medical benefits expense 7,866.8 6,853.1 4,927.4 ACA industry fee 135.1 81.6 Gross margin $ 1,072.4 $ 839.2 $ 733.8 Medicaid Health Plans MBR (1) 86.7 % 88.2 % 87.0 % Effect of: Medicaid premium taxes 1.0 % 0.9 % 1.2 % Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement 2.1 % 1.4 % Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR (1) 89.8 % 90.5 % 88.2 % Medicaid Health Plans Membership: Florida 781,000 722,000 486,000 Georgia 585,000 604,000 540,000 Kentucky 440,000 420,000 292,000 Other states (2) 582,000 564,000 441,000 2,388,000 2,310,000 1,759,000 (1) For GAAP reporting purposes, Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements are included in premium revenue to measure our MBR. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that these components are not indicative of operating performance. (2) "All other states" consists of Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, New York and South Carolina during all years presented. In 2014 and 2015, it also includes New Jersey. 2015 vs. 2014 Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $1.2 billion , or 15.7% , compared to the same period in 2014 . The increase was driven by increased membership in Florida due to organic growth and participation in the Florida MMA program, higher per member per month ("PMPM") rates related to the Florida MMA membership, growth in Kentucky from 60 Table of Contents increased participation in the ACA Medicaid expansion program and growth in Illinois resulting from higher auto-assigned membership. The increase in Medicaid premium revenue in 2015 also reflects a full year of premiums related to the Healthfirst NJ acquisition. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $1.0 billion , or 14.8% , compared to the same period in 2014, primarily driven by the increase in membership. Our Medicaid Health Plans MBR decreased by 150 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with 2014. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR decreased by 70 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to improved operating performance across the segment, in particular in our Florida MMA program, which included a rate increase for this program that was effective September 1, 2015, as well as unfavorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2014. The decrease was partially offset by a rate decrease in Kentucky that was effective July 1, 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $2.0 billion, or 35.6%, when compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in premium revenues was driven mainly by increased membership in Florida, due to organic growth and participation in the Florida MMA program, which commenced implementation on May 1, 2014. The increase in premium revenues is also attributable to Kentucky, primarily from our participation in the ACA Medicaid expansion and the additional members received following a competitor's exit from the Kentucky program in 2013. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was the net favorable effect of changes in the geographic and demographic mix of members, higher PMPM rates related to the Florida MMA membership and growth in New Jersey resulting from expansion and the Healthfirst acquisition. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflects the benefit of a full year's membership from the South Carolina and Missouri Care Medicaid acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2013. These increases were partially offset by our exit from the Ohio Medicaid program effective July 1, 2013. Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 39.1%, when compared to the same period in 2013, mainly driven by the increase in membership, higher current period medical and pharmacy costs, and higher medical costs associated with the Florida MMA program, which operated at a higher MBR than our 2013 performance in the state. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflects recognition of unfavorable prior year reserve development and a full year's membership from the South Carolina and Missouri Medicaid acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2013. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR increased by 230 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, due to the effect of higher current period medical and pharmacy costs, higher cost associated with the Florida MMA program and unfavorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2014 compared to favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2013. Pharmacy costs include increased spending on hepatitis C drugs as a result of the new, expensive drugs approved in 2014 as well as other pharmacy cost increases. Medicare Health Plans We contract with CMS under the Medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of Part C and Part D benefits to Medicare eligible persons through our MA plans. Our MA plans are comprised of coordinated care plans ("CCPs"), which are administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a primary care physician from a network of health care providers. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of most of our MA plans. In 2015, we operated our MA CCPs in 376 counties across 15 states, including Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans. For many of our plans, we provide additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced, which allows our members to better manage their health care costs. We will continue to focus on three main objectives in MA, including execution on medical expense and quality initiatives, a more disciplined portfolio approach to our MA bids, including a focus on net income, and improving Star Ratings, both in terms of execution on quality initiatives and our advocacy position to properly match the ratings, rules and economics with the prevalent data that demonstrates the causal connection between socio-economic status and lower quality ratings. 61 Table of Contents As a result of the Windsor acquisition completed on January 1, 2014, we began offering Medicare Supplement products. Accordingly, we included results for Medicare Supplement operations together with our MA plans within the Medicare Health Plans segment through June 30, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our Medicare Supplement business through the Sterling divestiture. The operations of our Medicare Supplement business were not material to overall segment results. Medicare Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare Health Plans segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 3,898.8 $ 3,963.2 $ 3,071.0 Medical benefits expense 3,401.7 3,506.9 2,659.5 ACA industry fee 68.7 44.7 Gross margin $ 428.4 $ 411.6 $ 411.5 Medicare Health Plans Membership 354,000 417,000 290,000 Medicare Health Plans MBR 87.2 % 88.5 % 86.6 % 2015 vs. 2014 Medicare Health Plans premium revenue in 2015 decreased $64.4 million , or 1.6% , compared to the same period in 2014 , primarily resulting from the decline in membership as a result of our 2015 bid actions, which included exiting two counties in California, as well as exiting from MA in Arizona, Missouri and Ohio. The decline also reflects the divestiture of our Medicare Supplement business effective July 1, 2015, partially offset by organic membership growth in Florida and Texas. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $105.2 million , or 3.0% , compared to the same period in 2014 , primarily driven by the decrease in membership discussed above and improved operational execution on medical expense initiatives launched in 2015. The Medicare Health Plans MBR decreased by 130 basis points compared to 2014, reflecting improved operating performance as a result of bid actions for the 2015 plan year as well as improved operational execution on medical expense initiatives launched in 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 Medicare Health Plans premium revenue in 2014 increased $892.2 million, or 29.1%, when compared to the same period in 2013. The Windsor acquisition contributed approximately $507.2 million, or 16.5%, to the year-over-year increase, while organic membership growth in Florida, California, New York and Texas drove the remaining increase. Partially offsetting these increases was the effect of CMS premium rate decreases compared to 2013. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $847.4 million, or 31.9%, compared to the same period in 2013, primarily driven by the increase in membership discussed above. The Medicare Health Plans MBR increased by 190 basis points compared to 2013, resulting mainly from the effect of CMS rate decreases and the federal government's budget sequestration, which took effect in April 2013, as well as unfavorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by changes to plan benefit designs and cost sharing terms in 2014 compared with 2013, as well as our ongoing medical cost management initiatives. Medicare PDPs We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDPs to Medicare eligible beneficiaries through our Medicare PDPs segment. As of December 31, 2015, we offered PDPs in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The PDP benefit design generally results in our incurring a greater portion of the responsibility for 62 Table of Contents total prescription drug costs in the first half of a plan year and less in the second half of a plan year due to the members' share of cumulative out-of-pocket costs increasing throughout the plan year. As a result, the Medicare PDPs MBR generally decreases throughout the year. Also, the level and mix of members who are auto-assigned to us and those who actively choose our PDPs will affect the segment MBR pattern across periods. Medicare PDPs Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare PDPs segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 901.7 $ 1,178.4 $ 776.9 Medical benefits expense 710.0 1,095.2 671.7 ACA industry fee 23.5 11.4 Gross margin $ 168.2 $ 71.8 $ 105.2 Medicare PDPs membership 1,025,000 1,392,000 797,000 Medicare PDPs MBR 78.7 % 92.9 % 86.5 % 2015 vs. 2014 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue decreased $276.7 million , or 23.5% , in 2015 compared with 2014 , primarily due to the decrease in membership resulting from specific actions taken in the 2015 bids. The Medicare PDPs MBR for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased 1,420 basis points over the same period in 2014, reflecting improvement from bid positioning taken to better balance membership and margin improvement for the 2015 plan year, an improvement in pharmacy rebates and improved operational execution. 2014 vs. 2013 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue increased 51.7% in 2014 when compared to 2013, primarily due to the increase in membership, which includes 103,000 members from the Windsor acquisition, partially offset by lower premium rates resulting from our 2014 bids. The Medicare PDPs MBR for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 640 basis points over the same period in 2013 primarily driven by higher drug unit costs, increased utilization of branded and specialty medications, the outcome of our 2014 bids and CMS rate decreases and the federal government's budget sequestration, which took effect in April 2013. 2016 Outlook Medicaid Health Plans - We expect premium revenue for our Medicaid Health Plans, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and the Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement, to be in the range of $8.75 billion to $8.90 billion for 2016, consistent with $8.8 billion reported for 2015. Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR is expected to be in the range of 89.0% to 90.0% for 2016, slightly down from 89.8% reported for 2015 due to momentum from improved performance in 2015 and our improved pharmacy cost structure that went into effect on January 1, 2016. Medicare Health Plans - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare Health Plans segment to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion for 2016, consistent with $3.9 billion reported for 2015. Medicare Health Plans MBR is expected to be in the range of 85.25% to 86.50% for 2016, compared with 87.2% in 2015. The expected year-over-year improvement reflects a continuation of a more disciplined bid process for 2016 and continued execution on medical expense initiatives. 63 Table of Contents Medicare PDPs - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare PDPs segment to be in the range of $900.0 million to $975.0 million for 2016 compared with $901.7 million for 2015, primarily resulting from our bid positioning for the 2016 plan year. Medicare PDPs MBR is expected to be in the range of 81.0% to 83.0% for 2016, compared with 78.7% for 2015 due to our bid positioning for the 2016 plan year. Consolidated SG&A - We expect that our consolidated Adjusted SG&A ratio, which excludes the effect of investigation costs, PBM transitory costs, $1.0 to $2.0 million in Sterling divestiture costs and Iowa SG&A costs, for the full-year 2016 will be in a range of 7.7% to 7.9%, consistent with 7.9% reported for 2015 given a slight increase in revenue. ACA Industry Fee expense - We estimate that we will incur between $223.0 million and $233.0 million of ACA industry fee expense in 2016, consistent with 2015, as the total fee to be levied on the industry will remain at $11.3 billion. Interest Expense - We expect that interest expense will increase to approximately $58.0 million to $62.0 million in 2016, driven primarily by the additional $300.0 million issuance of Senior Notes in June 2015. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is affected by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. Additionally, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent and other non-regulated companies ("non-regulated subsidiaries") are dependent upon dividends and management fees from our regulated subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity and cash flows, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors included in this 2015 Form 10-K. Liquidity The Company maintains liquidity at two levels: the regulated subsidiary level and the non-regulated subsidiary level. Regulated subsidiaries Our regulated HMO and insurance subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include: payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; selling, general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through a management services agreement to one of our non-regulated administrative and management services subsidiaries; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. Our regulated subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by: generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; receipts of prospective subsidy payments and related final settlements from CMS to reimburse us for certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. Funding may be provided to certain regulated subsidiaries from our unregulated subsidiaries to cover any shortfall resulting from the amount of Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS that exceeds the prospective subsidy payments that these regulated subsidiaries receive from CMS, which is discussed further in Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements below. 64 Table of Contents We refer collectively to the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as "regulated cash and investments." Our regulated subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, regulated cash and cash equivalents can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. Our unrestricted regulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2015 , compared with $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014, due primarily to the Medicare Part D 2014 plan year settlement received in October 2015 (discussed further in Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements below), cash flows from operating activities and $120.3 million of capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. These increases were partially offset by the $227.3 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS in September 2015, $152.0 million in dividends distributed to our non-regulated subsidiaries and a return of funding to certain non-regulated subsidiaries previously provided to support shortfalls resulting from Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS, discussed above, for the Medicare Part D 2014 plan year. Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. We continue to maintain appropriate levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated subsidiaries. See further discussion under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions below. Parent and non-regulated subsidiaries Liquidity requirements at the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level generally consist of: payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, business development, rent, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated subsidiaries; capital expenditures; debt service; and federal tax payments. Our non-regulated parent and subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by: management fees earned by our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under management services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments. Unregulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $816.1 million at December 31, 2015 , an increase of $726.6 million from $89.5 million at December 31, 2014. This increase reflects the receipt of $308.9 million net proceeds from the Senior Notes issuance in June 2015, $152.0 million in dividends received from certain regulated subsidiaries and a return of funding from certain regulated subsidiaries previously provided to support shortfalls resulting from Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS, discussed above, for the Medicare Part D 2014 plan year. These increases were partially offset by $120.3 million of capital contributions paid to certain regulated subsidiaries. Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. A discussion of the subsidy components under Part D is included in Note 2- Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2015 Form 10-K. The benefits include the catastrophic reinsurance, premium and cost sharing for low income Part D members, for which CMS will fully reimburse these subsidies as part of its annual settlement process that occurs in the fourth quarter of the subsequent year. Growth in our PDP and MA membership and high drug unit costs in 2014 resulted in higher benefit payments made on behalf of CMS compared with our bids and compared with prior years, as well as an increase in the CMS risk corridor receivable, and our unregulated cash will continue to be used to fund these benefits until they are settled with CMS. Based on our experience in 2014, our 2015 PDP and MA bids reflected significantly higher estimates for cash outflows for the government's responsibility of the Part D benefit plan design, particularly for the catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. However, the level of subsidy payments we made on behalf of CMS compared with our 2015 bids were still significant due to the composition of our 2015 PDP membership, which reflected a higher number of dual-eligible members relative to our overall 65 Table of Contents membership than expected in our original 2015 bids. In October 2015, we received an $845.5 million settlement payment from CMS relating to the 2014 Part D plan year, which resulted in a meaningful reduction in our CMS Part D receivable included in our funds receivable for the benefit of members as well as the CMS risk corridor. Government Investigation and Litigation Under the terms of the settlement agreements entered into by us on April 26, 2011, and finalized on March 23, 2012, to resolve matters under investigation by the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Civil Division") and certain other federal and state enforcement agencies (the "Settlement"), WellCare agreed to pay the Civil Division a total of $137.5 million in four equal annual principal payments, plus interest accrued at 3.125%. The final payment of $35.4 million, which included accrued interest, was remitted to the Civil Division during March 2015. We currently maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance in the amount of $125.0 million for matters not addressed above. Auction Rate Securities As of December 31, 2015 , $31.7 million of our long-term investments were comprised of municipal note securities with an auction reset feature ("auction rate securities"), which are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans, public projects and other activities. Two auction rate securities with an aggregate fair value of $21.0 million have investment grade security credit ratings and one auction rate security with a fair value of $10.7 million has a credit rating below investment grade. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process, which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every seven or 35 days. As of the date of this 2015 Form 10-K, auctions have failed for our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions will succeed in the future. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven or 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non-existent. In addition, if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may, in the future, be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. Although auctions continue to fail, we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss. There are government guarantees or municipal bond insurance in place and we have the ability and the present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored. Accordingly, we do not believe our auction rate securities are impaired and as a result, we have not recorded any impairment losses for our auction rate securities. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments' recorded value. The final maturity as of December 31, 2015 of the underlying securities could be as long as 22 years. The weighted-average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is 18 years. Cash Flow Activities Our cash flows are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 712.6 $ 299.3 $ 178.9 Net cash used in investing activities (124.2 ) (75.6 ) (290.5 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 505.1 (392.7 ) 493.6 Total net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,093.5 $ (169.0 ) $ 382.0 66 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating activities We generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services; however, cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premium receipts from our government partners. 2015 vs. 2014 Cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was $712.6 million compared to $299.3 million for 2014. The improvement in cash flow from operations primarily resulted from improved year-over-year operating performance across all segments and higher pharmacy rebates consistent with an improved pharmacy rebates management contract. The increase is also related to the timing of settlement of the current year Medicare Part D risk corridor payables due to CMS as compared to the Medicare Part D risk corridor net receivables in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by the $227.3 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS in September 2015, compared to $137.7 million remitted for such fee in September 2014. 2014 vs. 2013 Cash provided by operating activities for 2014 was $299.3 million compared to $178.9 million for 2013, mainly resulting from an increase in premiums associated with the growth in membership, as well as the timing of certain premium receipts, partially offset by the $137.7 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS during September 2014. Cash flows from investing activities 2015 vs. 2014 Net cash used in investing activities for 2015 increased by $48.6 million compared to the same period in 2014, resulting primarily from net cash used in acquisitions and acquisition-related settlements of $17.2 million in 2015, related to the final balance sheet settlement of the Windsor acquisition, compared with $48.0 million of net cash acquired from acquisitions in 2014. The increase is also a result of higher additions to capitalized software during 2015 resulting from investments in our information technology infrastructure. The increases are partially offset by proceeds from the sales of investments in 2015 compared with net purchases of investments in 2014. 2014 vs. 2013 Net cash used in investing activities for 2014 was $75.6 million compared to $290.5 million for 2013. The decrease in cash used in 2014 primarily resulted from a higher amount of cash used in acquisitions in 2013 relative to 2014, including $133.6 million advanced in December 2013 in connection with the Windsor acquisition, which closed in January 2014. Conversely, in 2014, cash flows reflect $48.0 million of net cash acquired from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, investment activities primarily reflect our investment in marketable securities and restricted investments, purchases of property and equipment and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments, which in combination, did not materially change year over year. Cash flows from financing activities 2015 vs. 2014 Cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by net funds received or paid for the benefit of members of our MA and PDP plans as well as debt-related activity. Cash flows from financing activities in 2015 increased by $897.8 million compared to the same period in 2014 primarily resulting from net funds received for the benefit of members of approximately $201.1 million in 2015 , compared to funds paid of $687.9 million during the same period in 2014. These funds represent the net amounts of prescription drug benefits we paid or collected in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government's portion of financial responsibility, net of the related subsidies received from CMS inclusive of the annual settlement payments. As discussed in Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements above, we received a $845.5 million settlement payment from CMS relating to the 2014 Part D plan year, which significantly improved financing cash flows for 2015 compared to 2014. Additionally, in June 2015, we received net proceeds of $308.9 million resulting from the issuance of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes compared to net proceeds of $298.6 million in 2014 resulting from a $300.0 million term loan (the "Term Loan") issued during September 2014. 67 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 Cash flows from financing activities in 2014 decreased by $886.3 million compared to the same period in 2013 primarily resulting from net funds paid for the benefit of members of approximately $687.9 million in 2014, compared to funds received of $34.0 million during the same period in 2013. Additionally, in 2014, we received $298.6 million in aggregate proceeds resulting from the $300.0 million Term Loan issued during September 2014, compared to aggregate net proceeds from debt transactions of $451.4 million in 2013. Debt-related activity in 2013 includes net proceeds of $228.5 million received in connection with the second amendment to our 2011 credit agreement and $587.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes in November 2013, partially offset by $28.5 million of payments made on the term loan under our 2011 credit agreement during the first three quarters of 2013. During November 2013, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes to pay off the remaining $336.5 million term loan balance under our 2011 credit agreement, plus accrued interest, and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes and organic growth opportunities. Capital Resources Senior Notes As discussed in Key Developments and Accomplishments , in June 2015 we completed the offering and sale of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes pursuant to a reopening of our existing series of such notes, under which $600.0 million of our Senior Notes were previously issued in November 2013. The 2015 offering was completed at an issue price of 104.50%, plus accrued interest, and resulted in a debt premium of $13.5 million, which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior Notes. We received net proceeds of $308.9 million from this issuance, after approximately $4.6 million incurred in debt issuance costs. Interest is payable on May 15 and November 15 each year. As of December 31, 2015 , our outstanding Senior Notes totaled $912.1 million . The Senior Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of November 14, 2013 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2013 (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") each between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; make other restricted payments and investments; sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; create certain liens; incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make other payments and guarantee indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and merge or consolidate with other entities. 2014 Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2015, our current portion of long-term debt included the $300.0 million Term Loan outstanding under our 2014 amended and restated credit agreement (the "2014 Credit Agreement"). The 2014 Credit Agreement provided for a senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the "2014 Revolving Credit Facility") of up to $300.0 million, which was not drawn upon. The Term Loan would have matured in September 2016 and the commitments under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility were scheduled to expire on November 14, 2018. Borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread between 1.50% and 2.625%, or a rate equal to the prime rate plus a spread between 0.50% and 1.625%, depending upon our cash flow leverage ratio (which was defined as the ratio of our total debt to total consolidated EBITDA). Unutilized commitments under the 2014 Credit Agreement were subject to a fee of 0.25% to 0.45%, depending upon our cash flow leverage ratio. The annual interest rate on the Term Loan was 4.50% as of December 31, 2015. The 2014 Credit Agreement contained negative and financial covenants that limit certain activities of us and our subsidiaries, including (i) restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness; and (ii) financial covenants that require (a) the cash flow leverage ratio not to exceed a maximum; (b) a minimum interest expense and principal payment coverage ratio; and (c) 105% of our required level of statutory net worth for our health maintenance organization and insurance subsidiaries. The 2014 Credit Agreement also contained customary representations and warranties that were required to be accurate in order for us to borrow under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the 2014 Credit Agreement contained customary events 68 Table of Contents of default. If an event of default occurred and was continuing, we may have been required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2014 Credit Agreement. Lenders holding at least 50% of the loans and commitments under the 2014 Credit Agreement may have elected to accelerate the maturity of the loans and/or terminate the commitments under the 2014 Credit Agreement upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. 2016 Revolving Credit Facility On January 8, 2016, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2016 Credit Agreement ) with an initial aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $850.0 million. We then repaid our $300.0 million Term Loan and terminated the 2014 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility ) of up to $850.0 million (the loans thereunder, the Revolving Credit Loans ), of which up to $150.0 million is available for letters of credit. The 2016 Credit Agreement also provides that we may, at our option, increase the aggregate amount of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an amount up to $200.0 million without the consent of any lenders not participating in such increase, subject to certain customary conditions and lenders committing to provide the increase in funding. There can be no assurance that additional funding will become available. Unutilized commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a fee of 0.25% to 0.35% depending upon our ratio of total net debt to cash flow. At closing, $200.0 million of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility was drawn upon and, along with $100.0 million in cash, used to repay our $300.0 million Term Loan. Borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, organic growth and acquisitions. Commitments under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility expire on January 8, 2021 and any amounts outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility will be payable in full at that time. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as ABR Loans that are outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) in effect on such day; (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%; and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%; plus (ii) the Applicable Rate. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as Eurodollar Loans that are outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement) for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate means a percentage ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum for ABR Loans and a percentage ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum for Eurodollar Loans, depending upon our ratio of total debt to cash flow, as calculated in accordance with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility includes negative and financial covenants that limit certain activities of us and our subsidiaries, including (i) restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness; and (ii) financial covenants that require (a) the cash flow net leverage ratio not to exceed a maximum and (b) a minimum interest expense and principal payment coverage ratio. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, we may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Lenders holding at least 50% of the loans and commitments under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may elect to accelerate the maturity of the loans and/or terminate the commitments under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under both the Senior Notes and the 2014 Credit Agreement. As of the date of this filing, we remain in compliance with all covenants under both the Senior Notes and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 10 - Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements Shelf Registration Statement In November 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that became automatically effective covering the registration, issuance and sale of an indeterminate amount of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, senior or subordinated debt securities, depository shares, securities purchase contracts, units or warrants. We may publicly offer securities in the future at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. 69 Table of Contents Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We may pursue alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives may include, but are not limited to, obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries, provided sufficient capital in excess of regulatory requirements exists in these subsidiaries and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. We believe that we have sufficient capital, or sufficient access to capital, including through the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, a statutory minimum, risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and have been adopted by most states. The statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries' minimum capital requirements could change over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. To the extent our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. Based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement, or net assets, for these subsidiaries that may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $807.9 million at December 31, 2015 , and $743.7 million at December 31, 2014 . The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, which was in compliance with and in excess of the minimum capital requirements as of those dates. Such statues, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. Some states require prior approval of all dividends, regardless of amount. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior 12 months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. We received $152.0 million , $68.0 million and $147.0 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. The 2015 amount included $29.0 million not requiring prior regulatory approval, and $123.0 million paid after obtaining prior regulatory approval. Under applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2015 , the amount of dividends that may be paid through the end of 2016 by our HMO and insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities is approximately $147.2 million in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. For additional information on regulatory requirements, see Note 17 Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 . Payments due to period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (In millions) Operating leases $ 156.8 $ 31.0 $ 53.7 $ 36.8 $ 35.3 Purchase obligations (1) 72.2 24.0 34.1 14.1 Long-term debt (2) 1,200.0 300.0 900.0 Interest on debt (3) 258.5 58.0 103.5 97.0 Total $ 1,687.5 $ 413.0 $ 191.3 $ 1,047.9 $ 35.3 (1) Our purchase obligations include commitments under contracts for equipment leases and software maintenance. (2) Represents the principal amount of our outstanding Senior Notes and Term Loan as of December 31, 2015. These amounts exclude the remaining $12.1 million debt premium on the Senior Notes, which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Senior Notes. (3) Represents projected interest on the $900.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes and $300.0 million Term Loan outstanding as of December 31, 2015. These projections exclude interest on the $200.0 million principal amount drawn under the 2016 Revolving Credit in January 2016. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2015 , we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table above. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable, medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable, and goodwill and intangible assets, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable We earn premium revenue through our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid-related and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid contracts with state agencies generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions while our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts establish fixed, monthly premium rates per member ("PMPM"), which are generally determined at the beginning of each new contract renewal period; however, premiums may be adjusted by CMS and state agencies throughout the terms of the contracts in certain cases. Premium rate changes are recognized in the period the change becomes effective, when the effect of the change in the rate is reasonably estimable, and collection is assured. Our contracts also have additional provisions as described in the sections below. 71 Table of Contents We recognize premium revenue in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. We are generally paid by CMS and state agencies in the month in which we provide services. On a monthly basis, we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan. We record premiums earned but not received as premiums receivable and record premiums received in advance of the period of service as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheets. Unearned premiums are recognized as revenue when we provide the related services. Member premiums are recognized as revenue in the period of service. We estimate, on an on-going basis, the amount of members' billings that may not be collectible, based on our evaluation of historical trends. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible. In addition, we routinely monitor the collectability of specific premiums receivable from CMS and state agencies, including Medicaid receivables for obstetric deliveries and newborns and net receivables for member retroactivity and reduce revenue and premiums receivable by the amount we estimate may not be collectible. Premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by CMS and state agencies. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, CMS and state agencies require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received for individuals who were subsequently determined by us, or by CMS or state agencies, to be ineligible for any government-sponsored program or to belong to a plan other than ours. Additionally, the verification of membership may result in additional premiums due to us from CMS and state agencies for individuals who were subsequently determined to belong to our plan for periods in which we received no premium for those members. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments and adjust premium revenue based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. We record amounts receivable in premiums receivable, net and amounts payable in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Supplemental Medicaid Premiums We earn supplemental premium payments for eligible obstetric deliveries and newborns of our Medicaid members in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. Each state Medicaid contract specifies how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid. We also earn supplemental Medicaid premium payments in some states for high cost drugs and other eligible services. We recognize supplemental premium revenue in the period we provide related services to our members. Medicaid Risk-Adjusted Premiums In some instances, our Medicaid premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the health profile of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the state agency's analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's Medicaid membership. The frequency of when states adjust premiums varies, but is usually done quarterly or semi-annually on a retrospective basis. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Medicaid ACA Industry Fee Reimbursement The ACA imposed certain new taxes and fees including an annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment on health insurers which began in 2014. As discussed in " Key Developments and Accomplishments ", we have received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all our Medicaid state customers, that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes for 2015 and 2014. Consequently, we recognized $219.2 million and $124.6 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 72 Table of Contents Medicare Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS provides risk-adjusted payments for MA Plans and PDPs based on the demographics and health severity of enrollees. The risk-adjusted premiums we receive are based on claims and encounter data that we submit to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience, or other data, and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured, which is possible as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS, when the ultimate adjustment settlements are received from CMS, or we receive notification of such settlement amounts. CMS adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retrospective basis. The first retrospective adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year. This initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retrospective risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We populate our models with available risk score data on our members and base risk premium adjustments on risk score data from the previous year. We are not privy to risk score data for members new to our plans in the current plan year; therefore we include assumptions regarding these members' risk scores. We periodically revise our estimates of risk-adjusted premiums as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjust our estimates to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. As a result of the variability of factors that determine our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums, the actual amount of the CMS retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates and could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We record any changes in estimates in current operations as adjustments to premium revenue. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately received. The data provided to CMS to determine members' risk scores is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, future refunds could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which CMS determines a refund is required and could be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Minimum Medical Expense and Risk Corridor Provisions We may be required to refund certain premium revenue to state agencies and CMS under various contractual and plan arrangements. We estimate the effect of these arrangements during each reporting period and reflect any adjustments to premium revenues in current operations. We report the estimated net amounts due to state agencies and CMS in other payables to government partners in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of our Medicaid contracts require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical benefits expense. To the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical benefits, we are required to refund to the state all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical benefits expense. We estimate the amounts due to the state agencies as a return of premium based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency. Our MA and PDP premiums are subject to risk sharing through the CMS Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. The risk corridor calculation compares our actual experience to the target amount of prescription drug costs, limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by CMS, less rebates included in our submitted plan year bid. We receive additional premium from CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% above the target amount. We refund premiums to CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% below the target amount. Based on the risk corridor provision and PDP activity-to-date, an estimated risk-sharing receivable or payable is recorded as an adjustment to premium revenue. After the close of the annual plan year, CMS performs the risk corridor calculation and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between the subsequent CMS settlement amount and our estimates. Beginning in 2014, the ACA required the establishment of a minimum medical loss ratio ( MLR ) for MA plans and Part D plans, requiring them to spend not less than 85% of premiums on medical benefits. The rules implementing the minimum MLR impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum MLR, including requirements to refund to CMS shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan MA contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum MLR. MLR is determined by adding a plan spending for clinical services, prescription drugs and other direct patient benefits, plus its total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums (after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees). These provisions did not have a material effect on our results of operations in 2015 or 2014. 73 Table of Contents A summary of other net receivables (payables) to government partners is as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2015 2014 Liability to states under Medicaid minimum medical expense provisions $ (32.9 ) $ (14.3 ) (Liability to) receivable from CMS under risk corridor provision (136.8 ) 84.7 Liability to CMS under MA/PDP minimum MLR provisions of the ACA (3.0 ) (1.7 ) Net (payables) receivables to/from government partners (1) $ (172.7 ) $ 68.7 (1) The components of net (payables) receivables to/from government partners are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as $172.7 million in current liabilities as of December 31, 2015, and $83.0 million and $14.3 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. Medicare Part D Subsidies For qualifying low income PDP members, CMS pays for some, or all, of the member's monthly premium. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. Approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year, or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy, a settlement payment is made between CMS and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience. The subsidy components under Part D are described below. Low-Income Cost Sharing Subsidy ("LICS") - For qualifying low income members, CMS reimburses us for all or a portion of the low income member's deductible, coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold. Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy - CMS reimburses plans for 80% of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out-of-pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. Coverage Gap Discount Subsidy ("CGDS") - CMS provides monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members. Catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and the LICS represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. We are fully reimbursed by CMS for costs incurred for these contract elements and, accordingly, there is no insurance risk to us. Therefore, amounts received for these subsidies are not considered premium revenue, and are reported, net of the subsidy benefits paid, as Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. The receipts and payments between us and CMS are presented on a net basis as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows since we are essentially administering and paying the benefit subsidies on behalf of CMS. Historically, the settlement payments between us and CMS have not been materially different from our estimates. The balance of funds receivable from CMS grew substantially in 2014 due to growth in our PDP and MA membership and high drug unit costs, resulting in higher benefit payments made on behalf of CMS compared with our bids and compared with prior years, as well as an increase in the CMS risk corridor receivable. Based on our experience in 2014, our 2015 PDP and MA bids reflected significantly higher estimates for cash outflows for the government's responsibility of the Part D benefit plan design, particularly for the catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. However, the level of subsidy payments we made on behalf of CMS compared with our 2015 bids was still significant due to the composition of our 2015 PDP membership, which reflected a higher number of dual-eligible members relative to our overall membership. In October 2015, we received an $845.5 million settlement payment from CMS relating to the 2014 Part D plan year, which resulted in a meaningful reduction in our CMS Part D receivable for our funds receivable for the benefit of members as well as the CMS risk corridor. CGDS advance payments are recorded as Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are set up for manufacturer-invoiced amounts. Manufacturer payments reduce the receivable as payments are received. After the end of the contract year, during the Medicare Part D Payment reconciliation process for the CGD, CMS will perform a cost-based reconciliation to ensure the Medicare Part D sponsor is paid for gap discounts advanced at the point of sale, based on accepted prescription drug event data. For a further description of the revenue elements related to our segments, see Part I - Item 1 - Business - OUR PRODUCT SEGMENTS . 74 Table of Contents Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable The cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of incurred but not reported ("IBNR") direct medical benefits expense. Medical benefits payable includes estimates for IBNR, amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and certain medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians, pharmacy benefit managers and providers of ancillary services. Recorded direct medical expenses are reduced by the amount of pharmacy rebates earned, which are estimated based on historical utilization of specific pharmaceuticals, current utilization and contract terms. Pharmacy rebates earned but not yet received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are included in pharmacy rebates receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Direct medical expenses may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Also, included in direct medical expense are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing arrangements. Medically-related administrative costs include preventive health and wellness, care management, case and disease management, and other quality improvement costs. Other medically-related administrative costs such as utilization review services, network and provider credentialing and claims handling costs, are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR. Our estimate of IBNR is the most significant estimate included in our consolidated financial statements. We determine our best estimate of the base liability for IBNR utilizing consistent standard actuarial methodologies based upon key assumptions, which vary by business segment. Our assumptions include current payment experience, trend factors, and completion factors. Trend factors in our standard actuarial methodologies include contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefit changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business, changes in membership and other factors. The following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable: December 31, 2015 % of Total December 31, 2014 % of Total (In millions) IBNR $ 1,187.9 77% $ 1,111.5 75% Other medical benefits payable 348.1 23% 372.3 25% Total medical benefits payable $ 1,536.0 100% $ 1,483.8 100% The factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months' utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. 75 Table of Contents Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. External factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may affect medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing changes may affect our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2015 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2015 were decreased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would increase by approximately $139.4 million. If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would decrease by approximately $136.3 million. After determining an estimate of the base liability for IBNR, we make an additional estimate, also using standard actuarial techniques, to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than the estimated base reserve. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. Our estimate of the provision for moderately adverse conditions captures the potential adverse development from factors such as: our entry into new geographical markets; our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled; variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical costs, including higher drug costs; changes in provider reimbursement arrangements; variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment and the severity of claims; and health epidemics or outbreaks of disease such as the flu or enterovirus. We consider the base actuarial model liability and the provision for moderately adverse conditions as part of our overall assessment of our IBNR estimate to properly reflect the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states. Changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. Differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as prior year developments, are recorded in the period when such differences become known and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense in such periods. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 1,483.8 $ 953.4 $ 733.0 (Divestitures) acquisitions (9.5 ) 107.0 71.6 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current year 12,189.5 11,481.4 8,333.2 Prior year (211.0 ) (26.2 ) (74.6 ) Total 11,978.5 11,455.2 8,258.6 Medical benefits paid related to: Current year (10,763.0 ) (10,089.6 ) (7,490.6 ) Prior year (1,153.8 ) (942.2 ) (619.2 ) Total (11,916.8 ) (11,031.8 ) (8,109.8 ) Balances as of end of year $ 1,536.0 $ 1,483.8 $ 953.4 Medical benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 developed favorably by approximately $211.0 million , $26.2 million and $74.6 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. A portion of the prior year development was attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, which is included as part of the assumptions. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year. Accordingly, the change in the amount of the incurred claims 76 Table of Contents related to prior years in the Medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period. Excluding the prior year development related to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, our estimates of medical benefits expense recorded at December 31, 2015 developed favorably (unfavorably) by approximately $78.1 million , $(48.1) million and $3.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Such amounts are net of the development relating to refunds due to government customers with minimum loss ratio provisions. The favorable development recognized in 2015 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization in our Medicaid Health Plans segment. The unfavorable development in 2014 was due to higher than expected medical services in our Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plan segments that were not discernible until the effect became clearer over time as claim payments were processed. The favorable development in 2013 was due mainly to the medical cost trend emerging favorably in our Medicaid Health Plans segment due to lower than expected utilization. Premium Deficiency Reserves We evaluate our contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. We establish a premium deficiency reserve ("PDR") when it is probable that expected future medical benefits and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and reinsurance recoveries for the remainder of a contract period. For purposes of determining a PDR, we do not consider investment income and contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. A PDR is recorded as medical benefits expense and in medical benefits payable. Once established, a PDR is reduced over the contract period as an offset to actual losses. We re-evaluate our PDR estimates each reporting period and, if estimated future losses differ from those in the current PDR estimate, we adjust the liability through medical benefits expense, as necessary. We had no PDR liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Many of our past acquisitions have resulted in goodwill, which represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units, which we determined to be the same as our operating segments. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $263.2 million , which consisted of $152.8 million and $110.4 million attributable to our Medicaid and MA reporting units, respectively. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it would be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Such events or circumstances could include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, among others. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we compare an estimate of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the applicable goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test based on our financial position and results of operations as of June 30 of each year, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting and planning process. The annual impairment tests are based on an evaluation of estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimated discounted cash flows are based on the best information available to us at the time, including supportable assumptions and projections we believe are reasonable. Our discounted cash flow estimates use discount rates that correspond to a weighted-average cost of capital consistent with a market-participant view. The discount rates are consistent with those used for investment decisions and take into account the operating plans and strategies of our operating segments. Certain other key assumptions utilized, including changes in membership, premium, health care costs, operating expenses, fees, assessments and taxes and effective tax rates, are based on estimates consistent with those utilized in our annual budgeting and planning process that we believe are reasonable. However, if we do not achieve the results reflected in the assumptions and estimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion of our goodwill, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment. Impairments, if any, would be classified as an operating expense. Based on the results of our annual impairment testing in 2015, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no further goodwill impairment assessment was necessary. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our intangible assets. During the second quarter of 2014, we recognized approximately $24.1 million in impairment and other charges. This primarily related to the $18.0 million partial impairment of certain intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of Easy 77 Table of Contents Choice Health Plan, Inc. as well as the full impairment of intangible assets associated with the purchase of certain assets from a small health plan in 2012. Lastly, the charges also included the resolution of certain matters related to the purchase price of our 2013 acquisitions. We were no longer able to recognize such charges as adjustments to acquired assets since we were beyond the measurement period established in the accounting rules for business combinations. During 2015, no events or circumstances have occurred, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our other intangible assets. Accordingly, there were no impairment losses recognized during 2015.
