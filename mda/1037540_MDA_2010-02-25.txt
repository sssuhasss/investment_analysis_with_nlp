Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business-Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: the impact of the continued global economic slowdown (including the related high unemployment and constrained credit), which is having and may continue to have a negative effect on the following, among other things: the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy and rental rates; the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short-term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; our ability to obtain debt financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt and our future interest expense; and the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); 44 Table of Contents risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and/or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8-K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report. Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, DC, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. From time to time, we also generate cash through the sale of assets. The impact of the current state of the economy, including the high rate of unemployment, continues to adversely impact the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy and rental rates. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and we believe this is proving to be true once again. 45 Table of Contents Although leasing velocity has generally improved in our markets since the beginning of 2009, particularly in New York City, the lack of meaningful job growth, the overall availability of space and the absence of meaningful new tenant expansion have negatively impacted lease economics. Rental rates have declined and transaction costs (including tenant improvement allowances and free rent periods) have increased. While it is not clear how long these trends will persist, our experiences in past recessions suggest that we will not see unemployment peak and job growth begin until the later stages of a broad economic recovery. We continue to believe that general office market conditions are dependent on the impact of a recovery in the labor markets. Because the individual labor and industry markets may recover at different paces, we may see varying degrees of strength or softness in our core markets. Throughout 2009 we have seen an increase in transaction velocity across all of our markets. Although overall supply has increased, demand has decreased and there has been negative absorption of available space. We expect tenants in our markets to continue to take advantage of the ability to upgrade to high-quality space, such as ours. Overall, we expect our occupancy to remain relatively flat during 2010. Given the volatility in the capital markets over the past 18 months and the potential to acquire assets at attractive prices, we took steps to improve our liquidity and enhance our capital position. Since the beginning of 2009 we raised a total of $1.8 billion from the following: (1) we raised $265 million in two secured financings, (2) in June 2009, we completed a public offering of 17,250,000 shares of common stock, which raised approximately $842 million of net proceeds, and (3) in October 2009, we completed a public offering of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $694 million. In 2010, we expect to repay approximately $78 million of indebtedness and to refinance or extend approximately $632 million of $646 million of other debt that matures, which amount includes our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt. As of February 19, 2010, we believe our combination of available cash of approximately $1.4 billion and borrowing capacity on our Unsecured Line of Credit of approximately $1.0 billion is sufficient to meet all of our existing development funding obligations, repay near term financings and provide significant capital for future investments. We believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital. In addition, we believe deteriorated market fundamentals, overleveraged real estate assets and existing property owners with insufficient capital resources will eventually provide opportunities for well capitalized companies and seasoned operators, such as us, to acquire high-quality assets at attractive levels. Opportunities to acquire properties may come through outright property acquisitions, joint venture arrangements or through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. While transactional activity in the office sector has yet to accelerate, our management team is actively seeking opportunities. We will maintain our disciplined investment strategy, which focuses on high-quality assets in supply-constrained markets, emphasizing long-term value creation. We believe the successful lease-up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long-term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in-service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. However, we do not anticipate undertaking new development projects in the foreseeable future without significant pre-leasing commitments from creditworthy tenants. For descriptions of significant transactions that we entered into during 2009, see Item 1. Business Transactions During 2009 . Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is 46 Table of Contents possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805 Business Combinations ( ASC 805 ) (formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141(R) ( SFAS 141(R) )), and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings as if vacant. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenant credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such criteria are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used as defined by guidance included in ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment ( ASC 360 ) (formerly known as SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, ( SFAS No. 144 )) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. 47 Table of Contents ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144), requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Effective January 1, 2009, under the provisions of ASC 805 (formerly known as SFAS No. 141(R)), we were required to expense costs associated with the acquisition of real property such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in ASC 835-20 Capitalization of Interest and ASC 970 Real Estate General (formerly known as SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects ). The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We begin the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed, (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction, or (3) if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entity governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of 48 Table of Contents net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair value below the carrying values have occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary. To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 970-323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures ( ASC 970-323 ) (formerly Statement of Position 78-9 Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures ( SOP 78-9 )), we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale. The combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with guidance included in ASC 805 (formerly known as SFAS No. 141(R)), we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded approximately $4.2 million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above- and below-market leases in accordance with ASC 805 (formerly known as SFAS No. 141(R)). For the year ended December 31, 2009, the impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately $42.2 million. These amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above- and below-market leases and straight-line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; revenue; 49 Table of Contents cash flows; leverage: and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenant industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenant credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and/or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenant credit is below our acceptable parameters. We consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. A rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. A rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.0 years as of December 31, 2009. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in ASC 605-45 Principal Agent Considerations ( ASC 605-45 ) (formerly known as Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or ( Issue 99-19 )). ASC 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with guidance in ASC 605-45. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. 50 Table of Contents We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360-20 Real Estate Sales ( ASC 360-20 ) (formerly known as SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate ). The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with guidance in ASC 805 (formerly known as SFAS No. 141(R)), we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 146, 147 and 139 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from 51 Table of Contents period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio ) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed-in Service. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests, losses (gains) from investments in securities, losses from early extinguishments of debt, net derivative losses, loss from suspension of development, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate and other assets, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. NOI excludes certain components from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. For a reconciliation of NOI to net income attributable to Boston Properties Inc., see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 126 properties, including properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2008 and owned through December 31, 2009, totaling approximately 30.1 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2008 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2009. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold. 52 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,358,000 $ 1,344,408 $ 13,592 1.01 % $ $ 90 $ 7,244 $ 1,828 $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ $ $ 1,438,517 $ 1,389,609 $ 48,908 3.52 % Termination Income 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % Total Rental Revenue 1,372,410 1,356,851 15,559 1.15 % 90 7,244 1,828 73,273 43,283 1,452,927 1,402,052 50,875 3.63 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 479,983 477,172 2,811 0.59 % 46 1,274 274 20,542 10,538 501,799 488,030 13,769 2.82 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 892,427 879,679 12,748 1.45 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 951,128 914,022 37,106 4.06 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 898,846 889,041 9,805 1.10 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 957,547 923,384 34,163 3.70 % Other Revenue: Development and management services 34,878 30,518 4,360 14.29 % Interest and other 4,059 18,958 (14,899 ) (78.59 )% Total Other Revenue 38,937 49,476 (10,539 ) (21.30 )% Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 75,447 72,365 3,082 4.26 % Interest expense 322,833 295,322 27,511 9.32 % Depreciation and amortization 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 321,681 304,147 17,534 5.76 % Loss from suspension of development 27,766 27,766 100.00 % Net derivative losses 17,021 (17,021 ) (100.00 )% Losses (gains) from investments in securities (2,434 ) 4,604 (7,038 ) (152.87 )% Losses from early extinguishments of debt 510 510 100.00 % Total Other Expenses 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 745,803 693,459 52,344 7.55 % Income before income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, gains on sales of real estate and other assets and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 599,671 $ 595,437 $ 4,234 0.71 % $ $ 44 $ 1,157 $ 179 $ 35,038 $ 23,577 $ $ $ 250,681 $ 279,401 $ (28,720 ) (10.28 )% Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures $ (1,524 ) $ (33,794 ) $ 32,270 95.49 % $ $ $ 15,007 $ (148,224 ) $ (1,425 ) $ $ $ 12,058 (182,018 ) 194,076 106.62 % Gains on sales of real estate and other assets $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 11,760 33,340 (21,580 ) (64.73 )% Net income 274,499 130,723 143,776 109.99 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships (2,778 ) (1,997 ) (781 ) (39.11 )% Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership (35,534 ) (14,392 ) (21,142 ) (146.90 )% Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate and other assets common units of the Operating Partnership (1,579 ) (4,838 ) 3,259 67.36 % Noncontrolling interest redeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership (3,594 ) (4,226 ) 632 14.96 % Net Income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 231,014 $ 105,270 $ 125,744 119.45 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 52. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $30,385 and $36,872, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $23,966 and $27,510, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 53 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of approximately $48.9 million in Total Property Portfolio rental revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $13.6 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $0.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $5.4 million and Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $2.0 million and an increase of approximately $24.3 million in straight-line rents. The increase in straight-line rent is primarily the result of us establishing in the third quarter of 2008 a $21.0 million reserve, which was reflected as a direct reduction of straight-line rent, for the full amount of the accrued straight-line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. The increases in contractual rental revenue and straight-line rent were offset by an approximately $10.4 million decrease in recoveries from tenants in 2009. Generally, under each of our leases, we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease. The decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in New York City, which resulted in lesser tenant recoveries due to decreased occupancy and, to the extent space was re-leased, leases are in their first year during which, generally, no tenant recoveries are earned. We also had an approximately $2.3 million decrease in parking and other income. We expect straight-line rents for the Total Property Portfolio to contribute an aggregate of approximately $60 million to $70 million in fiscal 2010 compared to approximately $42.2 million in 2009. Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $0.1 million due to the transfer of Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park to the Value-Added Fund on January 7, 2008. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for the properties and our continued ownership interest through the Value-Added Fund. The acquisition of 635 Massachusetts Avenue on September 26, 2008 increased rental revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to fully placing in-service our 505 9 th Street development project in the first quarter of 2008, our 77 CityPoint and South of Market development projects during the fourth quarter of 2008, our One Preserve Parkway and Wisconsin Place Office development projects during the second quarter of 2009, our Democracy Tower development project during the third quarter of 2009 and our 701 Carnegie Center development project during the fourth quarter of 2009. The One Preserve Parkway development project had been partially placed in-service during the second quarter of 2008. Rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $30.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In-Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9 th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 21,974 $ 20,090 $ 1,884 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 27,280 20,010 7,270 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 8,961 2,098 6,863 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,516 1,085 431 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 7,753 7,753 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 4,738 4,738 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 1,051 1,051 Total $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ 29,990 54 Table of Contents Termination Income We recognized termination income totaling approximately $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases. Approximately $7.5 million of termination income for 2009 related to a termination agreement with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue. Approximately $3.6 million of the total termination income for 2009 is non-cash and consists of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases. Termination income totaling approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, including $7.5 million of termination income related to a termination agreement with Heller Ehrman, LLP. Real Estate Operating Expenses The $13.8 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $2.8 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $1.0 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $10.0 million and Properties Sold decreased approximately $46,000. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in real estate taxes of approximately $18.0 million, or 9%, which was predominately due to an increase in real estate taxes in the central business districts in Boston and New York City. This was offset by overall decreases in utilities expense of approximately $7.9 million, or 9%, and other property-related expenses of approximately $7.3 million of which approximately $3.0 million relates to repairs and maintenance. The acquisition of 635 Massachusetts Avenue on September 26, 2008 increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating expenses from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $46,000 due to the transfer of Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park to the Value-Added Fund on January 7, 2008. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for the properties and our continued ownership interest through the Value-Added Fund. The increase in operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service relates to fully placing in-service our 505 9 th Street development project in the first quarter of 2008, our 77 CityPoint and South of Market development projects during the fourth quarter of 2008, our One Preserve Parkway and Wisconsin Place Office development projects during the second quarter of 2009, our Democracy Tower development project during the third quarter of 2009 and our 701 Carnegie Center development project during the fourth quarter of 2009. The One Preserve Parkway development project had been partially placed in-service during the second quarter of 2008. Operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $10.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In-Service Real Estate Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9 th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 6,929 $ 5,672 $ 1,257 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 7,057 3,466 3,591 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 2,477 883 1,594 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,257 517 740 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 1,777 1,777 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 751 751 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 294 294 Total $ 20,542 $ 10,538 $ 10,004 55 Table of Contents Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property decreased approximately $2.9 million, a 31.4% decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008. We expect our hotel net operating income for fiscal 2010 to be between $6.0 million and $6.5 million. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 Percentage Change Occupancy 75.1 % 77.7 % (3.3 )% Average daily rate $ 185.29 $ 217.70 (14.9 )% Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 139.19 $ 169.08 (17.7 )% Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Development fees increased by approximately $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to development fees of approximately $6.1 million for our 20 F Street and 1111 North Capitol Street third-party development projects. This increase was offset by a decrease in other development fees of approximately $1.5 million, of which approximately $0.5 million is related to the completion and placing in-service of our Annapolis Junction joint venture development project. Management fees decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the net effect of an approximately $1.0 million increase in management fee income offset by a decrease of approximately $1.2 million in service income of which approximately $1.0 million is attributable to a decrease in work orders and over time usage of HVAC in New York City. We expect third-party fee income for fiscal 2010 to be between $24 million and $27 million. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased approximately $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were approximately $602.6 million and $447.1 million, respectively. However, the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 decreased by approximately 1.70%. We currently have approximately $1.4 billion of cash in interest bearing accounts and therefore expect that our interest income will increase from 2009 unless and until such funds are deployed. Other Expenses General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was the net result of an approximately $8.5 million increase in payroll expense, offset by a decrease in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and a decrease of approximately $2.3 million related to abandoned projects in 2008. Approximately $5.6 million of the payroll expenses increase was related to an increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and approximately $3.1 million was related to the amortization associated with restricted stock equity awards. We expect our general and administrative expense for fiscal 2010 to be between $81 million and $83 million. The projected increase in our fiscal 2010 general and administrative expense is primarily due to approximately $4.5 million of incremental vesting of non-cash stock compensation and a reduction in capitalized wages. 56 Table of Contents On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These 2008 OPP Awards are part of a broad-based long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders ( TRS ) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. Under guidance included in Accountings Standards Codification 718 Compensation Stock Compensation (formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment ) the 2008 OPP Awards have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period (although awards for retirement-eligible employees will be amortized over a three-year period). Because the 2008 OPP Units require us to outperform absolute and relative return thresholds, unless such thresholds have been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we exclude the 2008 OPP Units from the diluted EPS calculation. See Notes 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent that the 2008 OPP Awards are not earned, and therefore the program is terminated, Boston Properties, Inc. will recognize an accounting charge of approximately $3.4 million during the first quarter of 2011. Commencing in 2003, we began issuing restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four- or five-year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting occurs in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of guidance included in ASC 715 (formerly known as SFAS No. 123R). To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $19.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2009, approximately $20.8 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $14.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.8 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five-year vesting period. The foregoing amounts do not include an aggregate of approximately $11.0 million of stock-based compensation granted to Edward H. Linde, our former Chief Executive Officer, in the form of LTIP Units between 2006 and 2009, of which an aggregate of approximately $6.1 million was expensed through December 31, 2009 and an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million will be expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of his passing on January 10, 2010. 57 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 as detailed below Component Change in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 (in thousands) Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgages $ (22,308 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (2,530 ) Reduction in borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit (4,852 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes and exchangeable senior notes) (3,463 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (33,153 ) Increases to interest expense due to: New mortgages / properties placed in-service $ 22,664 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014 on August 19, 2008 (excluding the ASC 470-20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) interest expense) 17,736 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 on October 9, 2009 9,376 ASC 470-20 interest expense 10,888 Total increases to interest expense $ 60,664 Total change in interest expense $ 27,511 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgages line item: Reston Corporate Center, Prudential Center, One and Two Embarcadero Center, Bedford Business Park, Reservoir Place, Ten Cambridge Center and 1301 New York Avenue. The following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in-service line item: Four Embarcadero Center, South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Office and Reservoir Place. As properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Assuming no material changes in the amount or terms of our existing debt, we would anticipate our net interest expense to be between approximately $355 million to $365 million for fiscal 2010. This is higher than 2009 due to the incremental expenses associated with BPLP $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes dues 2019 and a reduction in capitalized interest associated with the cessation of construction at 250 West 55 th Street. These items are offset by the additional capitalized interest associated with our projects currently under development. In addition, we expect that the cessation of capitalizing interest as a result of the suspension of construction at 250 West 55 th Street will result in approximately $25 million of additional annual interest expense until we restart the development project. The actual amount of our net interest expense for fiscal 2010 will be impacted by, among other things, any additional indebtedness we incur, any pre-payments or repurchases of existing indebtedness, fluctuations in interest rates and any changes in our development activity. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 470-20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) that requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer 58 Table of Contents nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 470-20 requires companies to retrospectively apply the requirements of the pronouncement to all periods presented. As a result of applying ASC 470-20, we reported additional non-cash interest expense of approximately $38.6 million, $27.8 million, $19.4 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The incremental interest expense for each reporting period is expected to be as follows: For the year ending December 31: Approximate Amount (in thousands) 2010 $41,200 2011 43,900 2012 29,800 2013 23,000 2014 2,500 At December 31, 2009, our variable rate debt consisted of construction loans at our South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Place Office and Atlantic Wharf (formerly Russia Wharf) construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit and our secured financing at Reservoir Place. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008: December 31, 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 6,326,350 $ 5,707,392 Variable rate 393,421 385,492 Total $ 6,719,771 $ 6,092,884 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 94.15 % 93.67 % Variable rate 5.85 % 6.33 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.12 % 6.15 % Variable rate 1.98 % 3.62 % Total 5.87 % 5.99 % Coupon/Stated weighted-average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.43 % 5.43 % Variable rate 1.75 % 3.07 % Total 5.21 % 5.28 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Approximately $5.6 million related to an increase in the Same Property Portfolio that was predominately due to accelerated amortization related to tenant terminations in New York City, approximately $3.4 million of the increase related to Properties Acquired and the remaining increase of approximately $8.5 million was attributed to Properties Placed In-Service. 59 Table of Contents Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $11.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $48.8 million and $46.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Due to the suspension of construction at 250 West 55 th Street late in the fourth quarter of 2009, we expect our 2010 capitalized interest to decrease and we expect a reduction in capitalized wages of approximately $2.5 million in 2010. Loss from Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot office project at 250 West 55 th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we will recognize approximately $7.2 million of other income during the first quarter of 2010. Between April 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of additional costs associated with the suspension of development. In addition, we expect to recognize approximately $700,000 of additional costs during the first quarter of 2010 associated with the suspension of development. These costs have been and similar future costs will be classified as real estate operating expenses and not as loss from suspension of development. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all-in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight-year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten-year term and, as a result, under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ), during the third quarter of 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with guidance included in ASC 815 (formerly known as SFAS No. 133) as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. 60 Table of Contents Losses (Gains) from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan. In December 2007, the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in-kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized losses (gains) of approximately ($0.2) million and $1.4 million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund. The remainder of the losses (gains) from investments in securities in 2009 and 2008 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as loss (gain) from investments in securities. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we recognized losses (gains) of $(2.2) million and $3.2 million on these investment. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by $2.4 million and $(3.2) million during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a result of increases and decreases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On June 9, 2009, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our Reservoir Place property located in Waltham, Massachusetts totaling approximately $47.8 million. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount had been adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the assumed note. Due to the repayment of the mortgage, we recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of the remaining fair value balance. On June 26, 2009, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our Ten Cambridge Center property located in Cambridge, Massachusetts totaling approximately $30.1 million. We paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.5 million in connection with the repayment and wrote off approximately $26,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs. On August 3, 2009, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loans collateralized by our 1301 New York Avenue property located in Washington, DC totaling approximately $20.5 million and we wrote off approximately $16,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs. 61 Table of Contents Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures During December 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment charges which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures ( ASC 323 ) (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55 th Street and the Value-Added Fund, respectively. In addition, in June 2009 and December 2009, we recognized additional non-cash impairment charges on our investment in the Value-Added Fund of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorates further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. In addition, during December 2009, our Value-Added Fund recognized a non-cash impairment charge in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144) related to our One and Two Circle Star Way properties in San Carlos, California totaling approximately $24.6 million, of which our share was approximately $4.2 million, which amount reflects the reduction in our basis of approximately $2.0 million from previous impairment losses. The One and Two Circle Star Way properties will be vacant by the end of February 2010 and leasing activity continues to be challenging, with market rents declining significantly. The Value-Added Fund has a mortgage loan collateralized by the properties which is non-recourse to us and which expires in September 2013 and includes a cash escrow in place to fund the interest expense and carrying costs through mid-2010. The Value-Added Fund is currently in discussions with the lender to modify the loan and as a result believes that the carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Value-Added Fund recognized the non-cash impairment charge to reduce the net book value of the properties to their estimated fair market value at December 31, 2009. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air-rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non-cash impairment charges in accordance with guidance in ASC 323), which represented our share of land and air-rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre-development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55 th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. 62 Table of Contents The following table presents actual financial information for the joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2009 for the General Motors Building and 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55 th Street, respectively. These acquisitions increased our income from unconsolidated joint ventures by approximately $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008.

Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten-year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $23.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we signed no new qualifying leases and our remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million. On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million was deferred and is being recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 of approximately $11.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively. We expect to recognize the remaining $1.7 million of gain during fiscal 2010. 63 Table of Contents Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9 th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in allocable income. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 115 properties, including properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2007 and owned through December 31, 2008, totaling approximately 28.9 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2007 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2008. Properties Placed In-Service includes our 505 9 th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in-service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March 23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold. 64 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,326,099 $ 1,288,085 $ 38,014 2.95 % $ 90 $ 23,177 $ 20,137 $ 12,138 $ 43,283 $ 3,837 $ $ $ 1,389,609 $ 1,327,237 $ 62,372 4.70 % Termination Income 12,443 6,882 5,561 80.80 % 100 12,443 6,982 5,461 78.22 % Total Rental Revenue 1,338,542 1,294,967 43,575 3.36 % 90 23,177 20,137 12,238 43,283 3,837 1,402,052 1,334,219 67,833 5.08 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 471,040 444,364 26,676 6.00 % 46 6,781 6,406 3,499 10,538 1,196 488,030 455,840 32,190 7.06 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 867,502 850,603 16,899 1.99 % 44 16,396 13,731 8,739 32,745 2,641 914,022 878,379 35,643 4.06 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 9,362 10,046 (684 ) (6.80 )% 9,362 10,046 (684 ) (6.80 )% Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 876,864 860,649 16,215 1.88 % 44 16,396 13,731 8,739 32,745 2,641 923,384 888,425 34,959 3.93 % Other Revenue: Development and management services 30,518 20,553 9,965 48.48 % Interest and other 18,958 89,706 (70,748 ) (78.87 )% Total Other Revenue 49,476 110,259 (60,783 ) (55.13 )% Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 72,365 69,882 2,483 3.55 % Interest Expense 295,322 302,980 (7,658 ) (2.53 )% Depreciation and amortization 284,452 274,268 10,184 3.71 % 2,767 10,527 8,357 9,168 638 304,147 286,030 18,117 6.33 % Losses (gains) from investments in securities 4,604 4,604 100.00 % Net derivative losses 17,021 17,021 100.00 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 3,417 (3,417 ) (100.00 )% Total Other Expenses 284,452 274,268 10,184 3.71 % 2,767 10,527 8,357 9,168 638 693,459 662,309 31,150 4.70 % Income before income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, gains on sales of real estate and other assets, discontinued operations and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 592,412 $ 586,381 $ 6,031 1.03 % $ 44 $ 13,629 $ 3,204 $ 382 $ 23,577 $ 2,003 $ $ $ 279,401 $ 336,375 $ (56,974 ) (16.94 )% Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures $ (33,794 ) $ 20,428 $ (54,222 ) (265.43 )% $ $ $ (148,224 ) $ $ $ $ $ (182,018 ) 20,428 (202,446 ) (991.02 )% Gains on sales of real estate and other assets 33,340 929,785 (896,445 ) (96.41 )% Income from continued operations 130,723 1,286,588 (1,155,865 ) (89.84 )% Discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations 7,274 (7,274 ) (100.00 )% Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations 259,519 (259,519 ) (100.00 )% Net income 130,723 1,553,381 (1,422,658 ) (91.58 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships (1,997 ) (84 ) (1,913 ) (2,277.38 )% Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnerships (14,392 ) (51,978 ) 37,586 72.31 % Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate and other assets common units of the Operating Partnership (4,838 ) (140,547 ) 135,709 96.56 % Noncontrolling interest in discontinued operations common units of the Operating Partnership (40,237 ) 40,237 100.00 % Noncontrolling interest redeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership (4,226 ) (10,429 ) 6,203 59.48 % Net Income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 105,270 $ 1,310,106 $ (1,204,836 ) (91.96 )% (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 52.

Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $38.0 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $23.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $8.0 million and Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $49.2 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $30.9 million in straight-line rents. An aggregate of $21.0 million of the decrease in straight-line rent is due to the establishment of reserves for the full amount of the accrued straight-line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. Approximately $17.3 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which relates to the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $2.4 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to fully placing in-service our 505 9 th Street development project in the first quarter of 2008 and our 77 CityPoint and South of Market development projects during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we partially placed in-service our One Preserve Parkway development project during the second quarter of 2008.

The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 Percentage Change Occupancy 77.7 % 80.0 % (2.88 )% Average daily rate $ 217.70 $ 217.23 0.21 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 169.08 $ 173.80 (2.72 )% Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily attributed to $2 million of acquisition fees and 68 Table of Contents approximately $3.8 million of ongoing management fees from our joint ventures that acquired the General Motors Building, 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55 th Street in New York City, as well as development fees of approximately $2.5 million for our 20 F Street third-party development project. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased by approximately $70.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower overall interest rates and decreased cash balances. The approximate average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $450.0 million and $1.7 billion, respectively. In addition, the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 decreased by approximately 2.80%. Other Expenses General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense increased approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily due to compensation expense associated with the 2008 OPP Awards offset by a loss in our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in abandoned project costs. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These 2008 OPP Awards are part of a broad-based long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders ( TRS ) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. Under guidance included in Accountings Standards Codification 718 Compensation Stock Compensation (formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment ) the 2008 OPP Awards have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period (although awards for retirement-eligible employees will be amortized over a three-year period). Commencing in 2003, we began issuing restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four- or five-year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting occurs in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of guidance included in ASC 715 (formerly known as SFAS No. 123R). To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $24.1 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $17.5 million of restricted stock and 69 Table of Contents LTIP Units granted in February 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five-year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as detailed below Component Change in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (in thousands) Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgages(1) $ (29,921 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (12,974 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding exchangeable senior notes) (6,924 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (49,819 ) Increases to interest expense due to: Refinancing of 599 Lexington Avenue and other new debt $ 16,875 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of exchangeable senior notes 13,209 Borrowings under the Unsecured Line of Credit 3,693 ASC 470-20 interest expense 8,384 Total increases to interest expense $ 42,161 Total change in interest expense $ (7,658 ) (1) Excludes refinancing of 599 Lexington Avenue. 70 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans at South of Market, Democracy Tower (formerly South of Market Phase II) and Wisconsin Place Office construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007: December 31, 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,707,392 $ 5,255,437 Variable rate 385,492 122,923 Total $ 6,092,884 $ 5,378,360 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 93.67 % 97.71 % Variable rate 6.33 % 2.29 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.15 % 6.11 % Variable rate 3.62 % 6.11 % Total 5.99 % 6.11 % Coupon/Stated weighted-average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.43 % 5.68 % Variable rate 3.07 % 5.88 % Total 5.28 % 5.69 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Approximately $10.2 million related to an increase in the Same Property Portfolio and approximately $2.2 million related to acquisition activity. An increase of approximately $8.5 million was attributed to Properties Placed In-Service. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.8 million due to the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 5 Times Square in February 2007. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $12.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $46.3 million and $33.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all-in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight-year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our 71 Table of Contents Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten-year term and, as a result, under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ), during the third quarter of 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with guidance included in ASC 815 (formerly known as SFAS No. 133), as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. Losses (Gains) from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. At December 31, 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund. The investment was previously included in Cash and Cash Equivalents. In December 2007, the fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in-kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized losses of approximately $1.4 million and $0.3 million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also maintain a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow our officers to defer a portion of their current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals. Our obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we have balances of approximately $6.6 million and $8.3 million, respectively, into a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. We recognized losses (gains) of approximately $3.2 million and $(0.3) million on the investments in the account associated with our deferred compensation plan during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. In 2007, we recognized 72 Table of Contents a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the prepayment fee and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures For the year ended December 31, 2008, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $202.4 million compared to December 31, 2007. During December 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment charges which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of the Company investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with guidance included in ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures ( ASC 323 ) (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55 th Street and the Value-Added Fund, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorate further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest, suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air-rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non-cash impairment charges in accordance with guidance included in ASC 323 (formerly known as APB No. 18), which represented our share of land and air-rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre-development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55 th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. 73 Table of Contents The following table presents actual financial information for the joint ventures for the period ended December 31, 2008 for the General Motors Building and 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55 th Street, respectively. These acquisitions will impact our income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures in future periods. The General Motors Building For the period from June 9, 2008 December 31, 2008 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55 th Street For the period from August 12, 2008 December 31, 2008(1) (in thousands) (in thousands) Base rent and recoveries from tenants $ 105,634 $ 34,587 Straight-line rent 7,965 5,545 Fair value lease revenue 79,365 12,506 Parking and other 1,798 523 Total rental revenue 194,762 53,161 Operating expenses 41,497 14,663 Revenue less operating expenses 153,265 38,498 Interest expense 82,266 12,547 Fair value interest expense 4,477 2,020 Depreciation and amortization 91,220 22,225 Income (Loss) before elimination of inter-entity interest on partner loan (24,698 ) 1,706 Our share of Net Income (Loss) (60%) (14,819 ) 1,024 Elimination of inter-entity interest on partner loan 16,932 Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures (60%) $ 2,113 $ 1,024 (1) Information for 125 West 55 th Street is presented for the period of August 13, 2008 through December 31, 2008. On June 1, 2007, our Value-Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza located in Herndon, Virginia for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was approximately $20.3 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million. Our share of the gain, which is included as income from joint ventures, was approximately $15.5 million which amount reflects the achievement of certain return thresholds as provided for in the joint venture agreement. Gains on sales of real estate and other assets On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million has been deferred and will be recognized over the project construction period generally, based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2008 of approximately $9.9 million. On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately $280.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $184.5 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of approximately $94.6 million and closing costs of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of 74 Table of Contents approximately $198.2 million. Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. As of August 31, 2008, we no longer provide management services for this building. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten-year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 and 22,250 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $23.4 million and $18.0 million of additional gain on sale of real estate, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million. On February 15, 2007, we sold the long-term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City and related credits, for approximately $1.28 billion in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $1.23 billion, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $713.5 million. Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations For the year ended December 31, 2007, Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, Newport Office Park and Long Wharf Marriott were included as part of income from discontinued operations. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations On November 20, 2007, we sold our Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E properties located in Loudon County, Virginia, for approximately $126.7 million. The Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E properties are comprised of three Class A office properties aggregating approximately 337,000 net rentable square feet and an office/technical property totaling approximately 127,000 net rentable square feet, respectively. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $125.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $55.0 million. On April 5, 2007, we sold Newport Office Park, an approximately 172,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Quincy, Massachusetts, for approximately $37.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $33.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $13.6 million. On March 23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott, a 402-room hotel located in Boston, Massachusetts for a total sale price of $231.0 million, or approximately $575,000 per room. The net gain on sale was approximately $191.0 million. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 consist of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns our Wisconsin Place Office property as well as our 505 9 th Street project. Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership decreased $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the decrease in allocable income. 75 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short-term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed. However, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project size and duration and our access to cost effective capital at the given time. The following table presents information on properties under construction for the year ended December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Construction Properties Estimated Stabilization Date Location # of Buildings Square feet Investment to Date(1) Estimated Total Investment(2) Percentage Leased(3) Weston Corporate Center Third Quarter, 2010 Weston, MA 1 356,367 $ 98,602 $ 150,000 100 % Atlantic Wharf (formerly Russia Wharf)(4)(5) First Quarter, 2012 Boston, MA 2 860,000 384,298 600,000 58 %(6) 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue(7) Second Quarter, 2012 Washington, DC 2 780,000 88,924 380,000 53 %(8) Total Properties under Construction 5 1,996,367 $ 571,824 $ 1,130,000 66 %(6)(8) 76 Table of Contents (1) Amounts include approximately $50.7 million of accruals. (2) Includes net revenue during lease up period. (3) Represents percentage leased as of February 19, 2010. (4) Property has a $215 million construction facility. We have not drawn any amounts under this facility. (5) Project has been updated to reflect the conversion of approximately 160,000 square feet of residential to approximately 200,000 square feet of office, increasing the total square footage to 860,000 square feet. In addition, the estimated total investment has been updated to reflect the completion of the interior build out of the residential component. The project includes 70,000 square feet of residential space for rent and 24,000 square feet of retail space. (6) Percentage leased excludes 70,000 square feet of the residential component and includes 24,000 square feet of retail space. (7) Includes 280,000 square feet of the residential component, 50,000 square feet of retail space in the residential component and 22,000 square feet of retail space in the office component. (8) Percentage leased excludes 330,000 square feet of the residential component and includes 22,000 square feet of retail space in the office component. Contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our Unsecured Line of Credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. We believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. Our capital strategy is to maintain access to multiple sources of capital including secured debt, unsecured debt, and public and private equity such that turmoil in one or more of these sources does not eliminate our access to capital. Consistent with this strategy, (1) in April 2009 we obtained a construction loan facility totaling $215 million (none of which has been drawn to date) collateralized by our Atlantic Wharf development to fund development costs, (2) in June 2009, we issued 17,250,000 shares of common stock (for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $841.9 million), (3) in July 2009, we refinanced our Reservoir Place property with $50 million of secured debt, and (4) in October 2009, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2019. These transactions bolstered our liquidity position and, with cash balances as of February 19, 2010 of approximately $1.4 billion and borrowing capacity on our Unsecured Credit facility of approximately $1.0 billion, we are well positioned to meet all of our current development funding obligations, repay near term debt maturities and make new opportunistic investments. Four assets held by our unconsolidated joint ventures have aggregate debt maturities in 2010 of approximately $658 million (of which our share is approximately $375 million). We expect to refinance these loans with secured debt and anticipate that aggregate proceeds will be sufficient to repay the aggregate existing debts. We and our unconsolidated joint ventures also have an aggregate of approximately $350 million (of which our share is approximately $271 million) of construction loans maturing in 2010. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, we have the right, and intend, to extend these facilities. In addition, we expect to repay an aggregate of approximately $78 million of secured debt on three assets in our Carnegie Center portfolio and one building in Cambridge, MA, upon maturity in 2010. Our Unsecured Line of Credit expires in August 2010 and contains a one-year extension at our option provided that we are not in default. We currently expect that we will exercise this option and extend the maturity date to August 2011. Our remaining capital commitments over the next few years are to fund our development program. 77 Table of Contents In addition to our Unsecured Line of Credit and property-specific debt, as of February 19, 2010 we also had approximately $4.1 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (including approximately $2.0 billion of exchangeable notes). All of this debt either matures or is redeemable between 2012 and 2019. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase unsecured senior notes for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or both. We will evaluate any such potential transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account the trading prices of the notes, our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. In total, our remaining capital requirements, net of anticipated funding from existing construction loans, to complete our ongoing developments is approximately $355 million, through the end of 2012, which includes approximately $10.7 million of costs related to One Preserve Parkway which was fully placed in-service during the second quarter of 2009. With available cash proceeds, access to our Unsecured Line of Credit and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio, we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements and pursue attractive investment opportunities. Finally, in prior years, we have been an active seller of real estate assets and, although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect any material asset sales in the near future. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend As a REIT we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. With a view toward increasing our equity over time and preserving additional capital, we reduced our quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2009 to $0.50 per common share. Based on our current expectation for taxable income over the next few years, and absent any unanticipated circumstances, we expect that our quarterly dividend will be approximately $0.50 per common share for the next several quarters. There can be no assurance that the actual dividends declared by our Board of Directors will not differ materially. Sales To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 78 Table of Contents Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, representing an increase of $1.2 billion. The increase was a result of the following increases in cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 617,376 $ 565,311 $ 52,065 Net cash (used in) investing activities $ (446,601 ) $ (1,320,079 ) $ 873,478 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 1,036,648 $ (510,643 ) $ 1,547,291 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.0 years with portfolio occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 95%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted of the following: (in thousands) Acquisitions/additions to real estate $ (442,844 ) Proceeds from redemptions of investments in securities 4,078 Net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (7,835 ) Net cash (used in) investing activities $ (446,601 ) Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled approximately $1.0 billion. This consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the equity offering in June 2009 and the net proceeds from the offering of our 5.875% senior notes due 2019 in October 2009, offset by the payments of dividends and distributions to our shareholders and the unitholders of BPLP and the repayment of our Unsecured Line of Credit. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Debt Financing. Capitalization At December 31, 2009, our total consolidated debt was approximately $6.7 billion. The GAAP weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 5.87% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 4.6 years. Consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total consolidated market capitalization was approximately $17.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Total consolidated market capitalization was calculated using the December 31, 2009 closing stock price of $67.07 per common share and the following: (1) 138,880,010 shares of our common stock, (2) 19,814,499 outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in Boston 79 Table of Contents Properties Limited Partnership (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 1,460,688 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Series Two Preferred Units of partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership, (4) an aggregate of 1,416,162 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $6.7 billion. The calculation of total consolidated market capitalization does not include 1,080,938 2008 OPP Units because, unlike other LTIP Units, they are not earned until certain return thresholds are achieved. Our total consolidated debt, which excludes debt collateralized by our unconsolidated joint ventures, at December 31, 2009 represented approximately 38.28% of our total consolidated market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness. For a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness. 80 Table of Contents Debt Financing As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $6.7 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 38.28% of our total consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of (1) $2.172 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured debt having a weighted-average interest rate of 6.01% per annum and maturities in 2013, 2015 and 2019; (2) $419.8 million (net of ASC 470-20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) adjustment) of exchangeable senior notes due 2036 having a GAAP interest rate of 5.958% per annum (an effective rate of 3.787% per annum, excluding the effect of ASC 470-20) and an initial optional redemption date in 2013; (3) $815.3 million (net of discount and ASC 470-20 adjustment) of exchangeable senior notes due 2037 having a GAAP interest rate of 5.630% per annum (an effective rate of 3.462% per annum, excluding the effect of ASC 470-20) and an initial optional redemption date in 2012; (4) $669.0 million (net of discount and ASC 470-20 adjustment) of exchangeable senior notes due 2014 having a GAAP interest rate of 6.555% per annum (an effective rate of 4.037%, excluding the effect of ASC 470-20); and (5) $2.6 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 5.65% per annum and weighted-average term of 4.6 years. The table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable, our senior unsecured notes and our Unsecured Line of Credit at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008: December 31, 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate mortgage notes payable $ 2,249,880 $ 2,375,150 Variable rate mortgage notes payable 393,421 285,492 Unsecured senior notes, net of discount 2,172,389 1,472,375 Unsecured exchangeable senior notes, net of discount and ASC 470-20 adjustment 1,904,081 1,859,867 Unsecured Line of Credit 100,000 Total $ 6,719,771 $ 6,092,884 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 94.15 % 93.67 % Variable rate 5.85 % 6.33 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.12 % 6.15 % Variable rate 1.98 % 3.62 % Total 5.87 % 5.99 % Coupon/Stated weighted-average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.43 % 5.43 % Variable rate 1.75 % 3.07 % Total 5.21 % 5.28 % The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 1.50% per annum. Unsecured Line of Credit On June 6, 2008, our Operating Partnership utilized an accordion feature under its Unsecured Line of Credit with a consortium of lenders to increase the total commitment under the Unsecured Line of Credit from $605.0 million to $923.3 million. On July 21, 2008, our Operating Partnership further increased the total commitment to $1.0 billion. All other material terms under the facility remain unchanged. Our Unsecured Line of Credit bears interest at a variable interest rate equal to Eurodollar plus 0.475% per annum and matures on August 3, 2010, with a provision for a one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions. There can be no assurance 81 Table of Contents that we will be able to renew or replace the Unsecured Line of Credit upon maturity on favorable terms (including the lenders total commitment) or at all. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of our Operating Partnership. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 0.125% per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in our Operating Partnership unsecured debt ratings. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to us at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. Our ability to borrow under our Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%; a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40; an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a minimum net worth requirement; an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and limitations on permitted investments. We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above. As of December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings and letters of credit totaling $10.2 million outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit, with the ability to borrow $989.8 million. As of February 19, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit.

(2) No principal amounts are due prior to maturity. On October 9, 2009, our Operating Partnership, BPLP, completed a public offering of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% senior notes due 2019. The notes were priced at 99.931% of the principal amount to yield 5.967% to maturity. The aggregate net proceeds to BPLP, after deducting underwriter discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $693.7 million. The notes mature on October 15, 2019, unless earlier redeemed by BPLP. 82 Table of Contents Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of their principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis points in the case of the $250 million of notes that mature on June 1, 2015 and 40 basis points in the case of the $700 million of notes that mature on October 15, 2019), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our senior unsecured notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. BPLP investment grade ratings on its unsecured senior notes are as follows: Rating Organization Rating Moody Baa2 (stable) Standard & Poor A- (negative) FitchRatings BBB (stable) The security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, as it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

(2) The initial exchange rate is 8.5051 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (or an initial exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of our common stock). In addition, we entered into capped call transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, which are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future exchange of the notes. The capped call transactions are expected to have the effect of 83 Table of Contents increasing the effective exchange price to us of the notes from $117.58 to approximately $137.17 per share, representing an overall effective premium of approximately 40% over the closing price on August 13, 2008 of $97.98 per share of our common stock. The net cost of the capped call transactions was approximately $44.4 million. (3) In connection with the special dividend of $5.98 per share of common stock declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 6.6090 to 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share of our common stock. (4) In connection with the special dividend of $5.98 per share of common stock declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 9.3900 to 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of our common stock. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 470-20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) that requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.

(2) On December 19, 2006, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts related to this financing and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense for this mortgage over the term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.41% per annum for the financing. The stated interest rate is 5.57% per annum. The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. 84 Table of Contents (3) The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.

(5) Formerly known as Citigroup Center (6) On November 13, 2008, we closed on an eight-year, $375.0 million mortgage loan collateralized by this property. The mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.10% per annum. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss resulting in an effective interest rate of 7.02% per annum. (7) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum and matures on November 21, 2010 with a, one year extension option, subject to certain conditions.

(9) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum and matures on December 19, 2010 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. (10) The mortgage financing currently bears interest at a variable rate equal to Libor plus 3.85% per annum. (11) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the assumed note. (12) Includes outstanding indebtedness secured by 91 Hartwell Avenue. (13) Formerly known as Russia Wharf. (14) We have not drawn any amounts under our $215.0 million construction loan facility. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum and matures on April 21, 2012 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. Contractual aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2009 are as follows: Year Principal Payments (in thousands) 2010 $ 347,382 2011 646,378 2012 105,404 2013 101,263 2014 125,237 Thereafter 1,308,557 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 94% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy mitigates us against future increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2009, our outstanding variable rate debt based on LIBOR totaled approximately $393.4 million. At December 31, 2009, the interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 1.98%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009 our weighted average coupon/stated rate on all of our fixed and variable rate debt was 5.43% and 1.75%, respectively. The weighted-average coupon/stated rate for our senior notes and unsecured exchangeable debt was 5.93% and 3.64%, respectively. 85 Table of Contents These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 86.57%, 85.49%, 85.32%, 84.40% and 83.74% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, after allocation to the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate. Losses from early extinguishments of debt result when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that adjusting FFO to exclude these losses more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions. Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Neither FFO, nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and neither of these measures is a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted, should be compared with our reported net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 86 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 231,014 $ 105,270 $ 1,310,106 $ 870,291 $ 438,292 Add: Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 5,043 Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships 2,778 1,997 84 (2,013 ) (6,017 ) Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership 35,534 14,392 51,978 46,568 44,718 Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate and other assets common units of the Operating Partnership 1,579 4,838 140,547 113,432 30,658 Noncontrolling interest in discontinued operations common units of the Operating Partnership 40,237 2,977 12,402 Noncontrolling interest redeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership 3,594 4,226 10,429 22,814 26,780 Less: Noncontrolling interest in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle common units of the Operating Partnership 820 Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations 259,519 57,082 Income from discontinued operations 7,274 19,081 18,303 Gains on sales of real estate and other assets 11,760 33,340 929,785 719,826 182,542 Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures 12,058 (182,018 ) 20,428 24,507 4,829 Income before income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, gains on sales of real estate and other assets, discontinued operations, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 250,681 279,401 336,375 290,655 288,300 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization(1) 446,718 382,600 295,635 283,350 274,476 Income from discontinued operations 7,274 19,081 18,303 Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures(2) 12,058 (182,018 ) 4,975 6,590 4,829 Less: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships share of Funds from Operations 5,513 3,949 437 479 113 Noncontrolling interest redeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership(3) 3,594 3,738 4,266 9,418 12,918 Funds from Operations attributable to the Operating Partnership 700,350 472,296 639,556 589,779 572,877 Add: Losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 2,675 31,444 11,041 Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 700,350 472,296 642,231 621,223 583,918 Less: Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership share of Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 94,078 68,508 94,298 96,902 94,946 Funds from Operations attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. after supplemental adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate $ 606,272 $ 403,788 $ 547,933 $ 524,321 $ 488,972 Our percentage share of Funds from Operations basic 86.57 % 85.49 % 85.32 % 84.40 % 83.74 % Weighted average shares outstanding basic 131,050 119,980 118,839 114,721 111,274 (1) Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $321,681, $304,147, $286,030, $270,562 and $260,979, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $126,943, $80,303, $8,247, $9,087 and $8,554, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $0, $0, $2,948, $6,197 and $6,662, less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,906, $1,850, $1,590, $1,584 and $1,719 and adjustment of asset retirement obligations of $0, $0, $0, $912 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 87 Table of Contents (2) Includes non-cash impairment losses aggregating approximately $13.6 million and $188.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 323 Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (formerly known as APB No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock ) and ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (formerly known as SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ).

We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. NOI excludes certain components from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. 90 Table of Contents The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. for the fiscal years 2005 through 2009.

(2) Amounts are included in the year in which the first optional redemption date occurs (or, in the case of the exchangeable notes due 2014, the year of maturity). (3) Committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of December 31, 2009 (tenant improvements and lease commissions). We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. 92 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Ventures We have investments in twelve unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 5% to 60%. Eleven of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $3.2 billion. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2009. In addition to other guarantees specifically noted in the table, we have agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of the loans.

All adjustments related to EITF 98-1 are noted above. (2) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the assumed note. (3) The loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (4) In connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint venture obligation to fund various escrows, including tenant improvements, taxes and insurance in lieu of cash deposits. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $23.9 million. We earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with our partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. (5) Principal amount does not include the assumed mezzanine loan with an aggregate principal amount of $294.0 million and a stated rate of 6.02% per annum, as the venture acquired the lenders interest in this loan for a purchase price of approximately $263.1 million in cash. (6) In connection with the capitalization of the joint venture, loans in an aggregate amount of $450.0 million were funded by the venture partners on a pro-rata basis. Our share of the partner loans totaling $270.0 million has been reflected in Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (7) In connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint venture obligation to fund tenant improvements and leasing commissions. (8) The financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. (9) An unconsolidated joint venture in which we own a 50% interest is the borrower of a $23.6 million mortgage financing collateralized by the land parcels at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street in New York City. We and our third-party joint venture partner each agreed to guarantee $11.8 million of the mortgage loan plus 50% of all other obligations agreed to by the borrower under the loan documents. The loan was scheduled to mature on May 8, 2009. However, because our partner is in discussions with the lender on a new credit facility, the lender has agreed that such loan amount need not be repaid pending finalization of the new credit facility. If our partner defaults on its obligation to contribute its share of the loan repayment amount, then we have the right to repay the entire loan amount, have the collateral released and proceed against our partner for reimbursement. 93 Table of Contents (10) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.20% per annum and matures on September 12, 2010 with two, one-year extensions options, subject to certain conditions, subject to certain conditions. In addition, we have guaranteed the repayment of approximately $9.1 million of principal (as well as interest on the loan), which amount is subject to reduction and eventual elimination upon attaining certain debt service coverage ratios. (11) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. (12) Mortgage financing totals $26.0 million (of which approximately $24.2 million has been disbursed as of December 31, 2009). The mortgage bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.50% and matures on March 31, 2011 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Value-Added Fund has entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 4.085% per annum on a notional amount of $24 million. The swap contract went into effect on June 12, 2008 and expires on March 31, 2011. (13) Mortgage financing totals $120.0 million (of which $103.0 million was drawn at closing, $7.5 million was drawn to fund tenant and capital costs, with the remaining $9.5 million available to fund future tenant and capital costs). The mortgage bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.75% and matures on May 31, 2011 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Value-Added Fund has guaranteed the payment of interest on the loan. The Value-Added Fund has entered into three interest rate swap contracts to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 3.63% per annum on an aggregate notional amount of $103 million. The swap contracts went into effect on June 2, 2008 and expire on April 1, 2011. (14) The Value-Added Fund has guaranteed the payment of (1) an aggregate of approximately $5.0 million of unfunded tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and (2) one year of real estate taxes. (15) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $66.0 million loan commitment collateralized by the retail entity of Wisconsin Place. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use development project consisting of office, retail and residential properties located in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and matures on March 29, 2010 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. In addition, we have guaranteed the repayment of approximately $825,000 of principal (as well as our share of interest on the loan, taxes and operating expenses), which amount is subject to reduction upon attaining a prescribed debt service coverage ratio. Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the 94 Table of Contents costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. Development activities on the site are nearing completion and this work will be performed in accordance with the environmental deed restriction and other environmental requirements applicable to the site. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. Reclassifications and Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been revised as a result of the adoption on January 1, 2009 of (1) ASC 470-20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) (See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) the guidance included in ASC 810 Consolidation (formerly known as SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 )) and ASC 480-10-S99 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (formerly known as EITF Topic No. D-98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities (Amended)) (See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (3) the guidance included in ASC 260-10 Earnings Per Share (formerly known as FSP EITF 03-06-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities ) (See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65 Transition Related to FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instrument s ( ASC 825-10-65 ) (formerly known as FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments ( FSP No. FAS 107-1 )). ASC 825-10-65 amends guidance in ASC 825 Financial Instruments (formerly known as FASB Statement No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments ) to require disclosures about fair-value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly-traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. ASC 825-65-10 also amends ASC 270 Interim Reporting (formerly known as APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting ) to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. ASC 825-10-65 was effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009 (See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). 95 Table of Contents In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855 Subsequent Events ( ASC 855 ) (formerly known as SFAS No. 165 Subsequent Events ( SFAS No. 165 )), which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. ASC 855 was effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2009. We have evaluated subsequent events through the time of filing these financial statements with the SEC on Form 10-K on February 25, 2010. Newly Issued Accounting Standards In June 2008, the FASB ratified the guidance included in ASC 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815-40 ) (formerly known as EITF Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity Own Stock ( EITF No. 07-5 )). The guidance included in ASC 815-40 requires entities to apply a two-step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock. The guidance included in ASC 815-40 was effective on January 1, 2009. The adoption of the guidance included in ASC 815-40 did not have a material impact on us. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 820-10-65-4 Transition Related to FASB Staff Position FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly ( ASC 820-10-65-4 ) (formerly known as FSP No. 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly ( FSP FAS 157-4 )). ASC 820-10-65-4 provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820-10 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. ASC 820-10-65-4 also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. ASC 820-10-65-4 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 820-10-65-4 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) ( SFAS No. 167 ), which modifies the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ( VIE ) and requires companies to more frequently assess whether they must consolidate a VIE. SFAS No. 167 is effective on the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 167 will have on our financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles-a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 ( SFAS No. 168 ), which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification ) as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of this Statement, the Codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. SFAS No. 168 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 168 did not have a material impact on us. Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations. 96 Table of Contents
