ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2015 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of our revenues by segment and our expenses from a consolidated perspective for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent material to the understanding of segment profitability, we more fully describe the segment expenses per financial statement line item. Financial and statistical data is also included here. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2016 . Liquidity and Capital Resources an overview of our financial position, analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, and commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW The Company had a record year in nearly every respect. We posted our 12th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis, which is a testament to the hard work of our 15,000 employees and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives. Our 2015 consolidated pretax income was a record $1.3 billion , a significant increase over the $975 million in 2014 . The $337 million improvement was driven by an increase of $230 million in revenues and a substantial decrease of $ 464 million in our fuel expense. Partially offsetting these benefits was an increase in operating expenses, excluding fuel and special items, of $296 million , or 10% , to support the increased capacity of 11% . We recorded $32 million of special charges in the current year related to a non-cash pension expense associated with the buyout of the obligation for certain terminated, vested plan participants, and a litigation-related matter. The growth in revenues of $230 million was driven by the growth in our business. We launched 20 new markets in 2015, including 10 new cities such as Charleston, Nashville, Raleigh-Durham, Milwaukee as well as San Jose and Liberia in Costa Rica. We now have over 1,000 departures daily across our network on peak days - a significant milestone for our airlines. We are providing more utility than ever before in our primary hub of Seattle, giving our customers substantially more non-stop destinations out of Seattle than any other carrier. The significant decline in fuel expense this year was driven by declines in fuel prices, while the increase in non-fuel operating expenses are primarily growth-related increases as we increased our capacity 11% . See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Accomplishments and Highlights Financial highlights from 2015 include: Reported record full-year net income, excluding special items, of $842 million , a 47% increase over 2014 . Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.51 was a 56.0% increase compared to 2014 . See reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP figures in Results of Operations. 18 Announced a 38% increase in the quarterly dividend, from $0.20 per share to $0.275 per share in January 2016. This is the third time the company has raised the dividend since initiating the quarterly dividend in July 2013, with a cumulative increase of 175% since that time. Paid $0.20 per-share quarterly cash dividend in the fourth quarter, bringing total dividend payments in 2015 to $102 million . Repurchased 7,208,328 shares of common stock for an average price of $70 during 2015 for $505 million , or approximately 6% of market capitalization at the beginning of 2015 . Since 2007, Air Group has used $1.3 billion to repurchase 56 million shares at an average price of $23.66 , representing about 35% of the Company's outstanding shares on December 31, 2006. Generated nearly $1.6 billion of operating cash flow and $753 million of free cash flow in 2015 . Since the beginning of 2010 Air Group has generated $5.6 billion of operating cash flow, and $2.6 billion of free cash flow. Grew passenger revenues by 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 , and by 5% compared to full-year 2014 . Reached a new long term agreement with Bank of America for the Alaska Airlines Visa credit card. The new agreement adds customer benefits, such as no foreign transaction fees, and is expected to generate an incremental $60 million of revenue in 2016. Generated record full-year adjusted pretax margin of 24.0% in 2015 , compared to 17.2% in 2014 . Achieved return on invested capital of 25.2% in 2015 , compared to 18.6% in 2014 . Lowered adjusted debt-to-total capitalization ratio to 27% as of December 31, 2015 . Air Group currently has no net debt. Lowered consolidated unit costs excluding fuel and special items for the sixth consecutive year, to the lowest level ever. Mainline unit costs excluding fuel have declined 13 of the last 14 years. Held $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2015 . 2015 Accomplishments and Highlights: Recognition and Awards Ranked the best airline in the U.S. by The Wall Street Journal's "Middle Seat" scorecard for three consecutive years.

Since 2007, we have repurchased 56 million shares of common stock under such programs for $1.3 billion for an average price of approximately $23.66 per share. In 2015 , we increased our quarterly dividend 60% from $0.125 per share to $0.20 per share, and subsequent to December 31, 2015 , we announced a 38% increase to $0.275 per share. Overall, we returned $607 million to shareholders during 2015 and expect to exceed that amount in 2016 . Outlook Our primary focus every year is to run a safe, compliant and reliable operation at our airlines. In addition to our primary objective, we remain focused on providing a hassle-free experience for our customers, and building a compelling brand to support growing our network. We recently enhanced our affinity credit card product offering, and in 2016 we are introducing a new premium class of service on our airplanes. Our refreshed brand and bold new brand expressions will roll out throughout our major airports and on our airplanes in 2016 as well. Similar to the past several years, we expect to continue our growth plans over the next year. Currently, we expect to grow our system-wide capacity by approximately 8% in 2016, compared to 10.6% in 2015. Over the past few years, we have seen competitive capacity increase significantly in our markets, especially in our hometown of Seattle. We expect to see even more competitive capacity in 2016. Current schedules indicate competitive capacity will be 13% higher in the first quarter and 14% higher in the second quarter of 2016. We believe that our product, our operation, our engaged employees and award-winning service, combined with our strong balance sheet give us the ability to compete vigorously in our markets. Because of our strong financial position, low costs, and high number of unencumbered aircraft, we have an ability to flex our fleet to meet demands and allocate capacity in the markets that meet our return objectives. With our growth plans and the expectation for lower non-fuel unit costs and steady fuel costs for 2016, we believe our financial performance will continue to be strong. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains or losses or other individual revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because: By eliminating fuel expense and certain special items from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. 2013 Operating revenue per ASM (RASM) excludes a favorable, one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million primarily related to our modified affinity card agreement with Bank of America, executed in July 2013. In accordance with accounting standards, we recorded this item in the third quarter of 2013, and it reflects a non-cash adjustment of the value of miles outstanding in the program. We believe it is appropriate to exclude this special revenue item from recurring revenues from operations. Cost per ASM (CASM) excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted income before income tax and CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) are important metrics for the employee incentive plan that covers all Air Group employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as mark-to-market hedging adjustments, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. 2015 COMPARED WITH 2014 Our consolidated net income for 2015 was $848 million , or $6.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $605 million , or $4.42 per diluted share, in 2014 . Excluding the impact of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, and special items, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2015 was $842 million , or $6.51 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $571 million , or $4.18 per share, in 2014 . 21 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Net income and diluted EPS as reported $ 848 $ 6.56 $ 605 $ 4.42 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, net of tax (15 ) (0.11 ) Special items, net of tax 20 0.15 (19 ) (0.13 ) Special income tax benefit (26 ) (0.20 ) Non-GAAP adjusted income and per-share amounts $ 842 $ 6.51 $ 571 $ 4.18 Our operating costs per ASM (CASM) are summarized below: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 % Change Consolidated: Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 10.77 12.21 (11.8 ) Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 2.39 3.93 (39.2 ) Special items 0.08 (0.08 ) NM CASM, excluding fuel and fleet transition costs 8.30 8.36 (0.7 ) Mainline: Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 9.77 11.15 (12.4 ) Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 2.29 3.79 (39.6 ) Special items 0.09 (0.09 ) NM CASM, excluding fuel 7.39 7.45 (0.8 ) NM - Not meaningful 22 OPERATING STATISTICS SUMMARY (unaudited) Alaska Air Group, Inc.

The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,939 $ 3,774 4 Regional 854 805 6 Total passenger revenue $ 4,793 $ 4,579 5 Freight and mail 108 114 (5 ) Other - net 697 675 3 Total operating revenues $ 5,598 $ 5,368 4 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2015 increased by 4% on a 10.7% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 5.8% decrease in PRASM compared to 2014 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes, larger aircraft added to our fleet, and increased utilization of our aircraft. The decrease in PRASM was driven by a 4.4% decrease in ticket yield, combined with a 1.2 point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. The decline in ticket yield was primarily due to increased competitive capacity in the markets we serve, and our own growth. Furthermore, the significant decline in fuel prices has had an impact on lower ticket prices. The decline in load factor was also a result of increased capacity. We expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2016 . However, we expect total passenger revenue will increase from 2015 , although likely less than our growth rate in capacity. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $49 million , or 6% , compared to 2014 due to a 9.7% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in PRASM compared to 2014 . The increase in capacity is due to an increase in departures, and average aircraft stage length. The decrease in PRASM was due to a 3.8% decrease in ticket yield, partially offset by an increase in load factor of 0.3 point s. The decline in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth as we strengthen our network utility in the Pacific Northwest. We expect Regional passenger revenue to increase in 2016 , primarily due to the annualization of new routes introduced in 2015, and additional regional routes scheduled to be added in 2016. Other Net Other net revenue increased $22 million , or 3% , from 2014 , due to increases in Mileage Plan revenue and food and beverage sales, partially offset by lower bag fee revenues. Mileage Plan revenue increased $34 million or 12% , due to increased miles sold. Food and beverage sales were higher due to the 8.9% increase in passengers and selling more premium offerings, such as Tom Douglas signature meals. Bag fee revenue was lower due to promotions launched in January to offer a free first checked bag to our Mileage Plan members, and to all Alaska Airlines Signature Visa credit card holders beginning in February. This decline was partially offset by incremental revenue from our affinity card bank partner. We expect our Other net revenue to experience an increase at a pace higher than the expected increase in passengers in 2016 , due primarily to the extended agreement with our affinity credit card bank partner effective January 1, 2016. We expect this agreement will result in an incremental $60 million of revenue in 2016. 24 OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses decreased $106 million , or 2% , compared to 2014 , primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 % Change Fuel expense $ 954 $ 1,418 (33 ) Non-fuel expenses 3,314 3,018 10 Special items 32 (30 ) NM Total Operating Expenses $ 4,300 $ 4,406 (2 ) NM - Not Meaningful Significant operating expense variances from 2014 are more fully described below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2015 by $118 million , or 10% , compared to 2014 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 % Change Wages $ 945 $ 862 10 Medical and other benefits 153 150 2 Defined contribution plans 60 53 13 Pension - Defined benefit plans 28 9 211 Payroll taxes 68 62 10 Total wages and benefits $ 1,254 $ 1,136 10 Wages increased 10% , primarily due to an 8.8% increase in FTEs and the annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates. The increase in FTEs was to support the growth in our business. Defined contribution plans increased 13% due to increased contributions throughout all labor groups and an increased matched percentage as a part of recent labor contracts. Pension expense increased $19 million , compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to higher amortization of actuarial losses from previous years due primarily to a lower discount rate used to value the pension obligation at December 31, 2014 . We expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2016 compared to 2015 on a 4% to 5% increase in FTEs. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $120 million in 2015 from $116 million in 2014 . The increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial performance more so than in the prior year, coupled with a higher wage base. 25 Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Aircraft fuel expense can be volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. Aircraft fuel expense decreased $464 million , or 33% compared to 2014 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 935 $ 1.84 $ 1,400 $ 2.99 Losses on settled hedges 19 0.04 41 0.09 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 954 $ 1.88 $ 1,441 $ 3.08 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (23 ) (0.05 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 954 $ 1.88 $ 1,418 $ 3.03 Fuel gallons 508 469 Fuel gallons consumed increased 8.3% in line with the 10.6% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 2.2% improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by ASMs per gallon. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 38.5% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2015 was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 48% and a decrease in refining margins of 11% , when compared to the prior year. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from, or pay to, hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $19 million in 2015 , compared to losses of $41 million in 2014 . These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. The decrease in losses on settled hedges is primarily due to our increased use of "out of the money" call options as well as purchasing shorter-dated options, both of which reduce the premium cost we pay. We currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 37% lower in the first quarter of 2016 than the first quarter of 2015 due to lower West Coast jet fuel prices and the decrease in premium costs related to our fuel hedge program. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance costs increased by $24 million , or 10% , compared to the prior year. Maintenance costs increased due to more scheduled engine maintenance events that were more expensive due to replacing life-limited parts, and heavier airframe checks. 26 We expect aircraft maintenance to be 5% to 8% higher in 2016 primarily due to the timing of maintenance events as our fleet ages and from lease return costs as we return 13 B737-400 aircraft to lessors. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rental expenses increased $17 million , or 6% , primarily due to increased flying in 2015 , as we increased capacity and entered new markets. We expect landing fees and other rental expenses to increase in 2016 in line with the expected capacity growth and higher rates at the airports where we operate. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $18 million , or 9% , when compared to 2014 . The increase is primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us with passenger and ramp handling. We expect contracted services to be higher in 2016 due to higher rates and volumes as we continue to expand into new markets utilizing vendor services. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $12 million , or 6% , compared to 2014 , mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in Seattle and increased credit card commissions due to higher revenue. We expect selling expense to increase approximately 10% in 2016 , as we refresh our brand and increase promotion and advertising in our core markets, and as revenues increase. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $26 million , or 9% , due to the increased number of aircraft in our fleet, and cabin upgrades made in the past 18 months. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase approximately 15% in 2016 as we continue to purchase aircraft for replacement of leased aircraft and for growth. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expenses increased by $20 million , or 22% , due to the increased number of passengers, and upgrades to our onboard menu, offering higher quality food and beverage products. We expect food and beverage expenses to increase approximately 5% in 2016 primarily because of the expected increase in passengers. Third-party regional carrier expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPA agreements, increased $14 million , or 24% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . The increase is primarily due to the five E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest added to our regional operation in 2015. We expect third-party regional carrier expense to increase in 2016 as we continue to expand our regional network. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $48 million , or 16% , compared to 2014 . The increase is primarily due to professional services with regard to our brand refresh and network strategy, personnel costs for our flight crews, and IT-related costs. We expect other operating expenses to increase 3% to 5% in 2016 , primarily as a result of IT-related investments. 27 Special Items In the fourth quarter of 2015 , we recorded special items of $32 million ($20 million after tax). This is due to a $14 million million non-cash pension settlement expense related to lump-sum payments made to terminated, vested participants which removed them from participation in the pension plan, and an $18 million expense related to ongoing litigation. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2015 , we recorded nonoperating income of $14 million , compared to $13 million in 2014 . In the prior year, we recognized gains on the sale of certain equity securities. In the current year, we have capitalized more of our interest expense on an increasing balance of prepaid aircraft deposits. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile We are presenting our line-item expenses below both in absolute dollars and on an ASM basis to highlight areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity.

Additional Segment Information Refer to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. Alaska Mainline Pretax profit for Alaska Mainline was $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to $834 million in 2014 . The $165 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue is described previously. Mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by $236 million , due to higher wages to support our growth, higher ramp and passenger handling associated with increased flying, higher depreciation related to our fleet growth, and increased food and beverage costs. Economic fuel cost, as defined above, decreased due to lower raw fuel costs, and increased fuel efficiency, slightly offset by an increase in consumption. Alaska Regional Pretax profit for Alaska Regional was $105 million in 2015 compared to $74 million in 2014 . The $49 million increase in Alaska Regional passenger revenue is described above. The increase in revenue and the significant decline in fuel costs were partially offset by higher expenses to support additional departures. 28 Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $28 million in 2015 compared to $17 million in 2014 . CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) increased due to additional capacity and higher rates. The $26 million increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was largely driven by increased engine maintenance and other expenses to support the increase in capacity. 2014 COMPARED WITH 2013 Our consolidated net income for 2014 was $605 million , or $4.42 per diluted share, compared to net income of $508 million , or $3.58 per diluted share, in 2013 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2014 , we recognized net mark-to-market losses of $23 million ( $15 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) compared to gains of $8 million ( $5 million after tax, or $0.03 per share) in 2013 . In 2014 , we recognized a one-time, non-cash benefit from the curtailment of certain post-retirement benefit plans of $20 million and a one-time gain associated with the settlement of a legal matter of $10 million . The aggregate $30 million ( $19.0 million in aggregate after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share) is included in Special items in the consolidated statement of operations. In 2013 , we recognized a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million ( $120 million after tax, or $0.85 per diluted share) that resulted from the application of new accounting rules associated with the modified Bank of America Affinity Card Agreement, and the effect of an increase in the estimate of the number of frequent flier miles expected to expire unused. Excluding the mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, special items, and the one-time Special mileage plan revenue item, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2014 was $571 million , or $4.18 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $383 million , or $2.70 per share, in 2013 . Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 2013 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Net income and diluted EPS as reported $ 605 $ 4.42 $ 508 $ 3.58 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, net of tax (15 ) (0.11 ) (5 ) (0.03 ) Special items, net of tax (19 ) (0.13 ) Special mileage plan revenue, net of tax (120 ) (0.85 ) Non-GAAP adjusted income and per-share amounts $ 571 $ 4.18 $ 383 $ 2.70 Revenues adjusted for the one-time Special mileage plan item is as follows: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 2013 % Change Total operating revenues $ 5,368 $ 5,156 4.1 Less: Special mileage plan revenue 192 NM Adjusted Revenue $ 5,368 $ 4,964 8.1 Consolidated ASMs 36,078 33,672 7.1 RASM 14.88 14.74 0.9 NM - Not meaningful Our operating costs per ASM are summarized below: 29 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 2013 % Change Consolidated: Total operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 12.21 12.82 (4.8 ) Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.93 4.35 (9.7 ) Special items (0.08 ) NM CASM, excluding fuel and fleet transition costs 8.36 8.47 (1.3 ) Mainline: Total mainline operating expenses per ASM (CASM) 11.15 11.77 (5.3 ) Less the following components: Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses 3.79 4.23 (10.4 ) Special items (0.09 ) NM CASM, excluding fuel 7.45 7.54 (1.2 ) NM - Not Meaningful OPERATING REVENUES Total operating revenues increased $212 million , or 4% , during 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 . Adjusted for the Special mileage plan revenue item recognized in 2013, operating revenues increased $404 million, or 8%, during 2014 . The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,774 $ 3,490 8 Regional 805 777 4 Total passenger revenue $ 4,579 $ 4,267 7 Freight and mail 114 113 1 Other - net 675 584 16 Special mileage plan revenue 192 NM Total operating revenues $ 5,368 $ 5,156 4 NM - Not meaningful Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2014 increased by 8% on a 6.6% increase in capacity and a 1.4% increase in PRASM compared to 2013 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes, seats added to our existing fleet as part of our cabin improvement project, and delivery of 10 737-900ERs in 2014 . The increase in PRASM was driven by a 1.9% increase in ticket yield, partially offset by a 0.4-point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. Increase in yield was due to reallocation of capacity to markets with stronger demand and by a change in revenue allocation between Mainline and Regional service because of certain industry pricing changes. Without the industry change, Mainline yields would have increased by 0.9%. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $28 million , or 4% , compared to 2013 on an 11.9% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 7.3% decline in PRASM compared to 2013 . The decrease in PRASM was due to a 6.2% decrease in ticket yield coupled with a 1.0-point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. The decline in yield was primarily driven by a change in revenue allocation between Mainline and Regional service because of certain industry pricing changes. Without the revenue allocation adjustment, yield would have decreased 1.7%. Additionally, the average trip length for our Regional flights increased 3% in 2014 , which also put downward pressure on yields. 30 Other Net Other net revenue increased $91 million , or 16% , from 2013 . This is primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of $39 million, or 15%, due to an increase in miles sold and an increase in cash received per mile. Additionally, bag fees and ticket change fees are up 23% and 12%, respectively, due to changes in our fee structure that took effect in November 2013. Special Mileage Plan Revenue In 2013, we modified and extended our co-branded credit card agreement with BAC. In connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards, we recorded a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to Bank of America Corporation (referred to herein as BAC). OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $88 million , or 2% , compared to 2013 , primarily driven by higher non-fuel costs due to increased capacity. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,418 $ 1,467 (3 ) Non-fuel expenses 3,018 2,851 6 Special items (30 ) NM Total Operating Expenses $ 4,406 $ 4,318 2 Significant operating expense variances from 2013 are more fully described below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2014 by $50 million , or 5% , compared to 2013 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 % Change Wages $ 862 $ 788 9 Medical and other benefits 150 145 3 Defined contribution plans 53 44 20 Pension - Defined benefit plans 9 50 (82 ) Payroll taxes 62 59 5 Total wages and benefits $ 1,136 $ 1,086 5 Wages increased 9% , primarily due to annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates, a 4.7% increase in full-time equivalent employees, and an $8 million signing bonus paid to Alaska's flight attendants in December 2014 in connection with the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement. the increase in FTEs was to support the growth in our business. Defined contribution plan expense increased 20% due to an increase in the number of employees participating in the plans and an increase in the employer contribution for non-union employees previously in the pension plan. Pension expense decreased 82% , compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets, a higher discount rate at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 , and the freezing of plan benefits for our non-union employees beginning January 1, 2014. 31 Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $105 million in 2013 to $116 million in 2014 . The increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense decreased $49 million , or 3% compared to 2013 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 2013 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,400 $ 2.99 $ 1,423 $ 3.19 Gains on settled hedges 41 0.09 52 0.11 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,441 $ 3.08 $ 1,475 $ 3.30 Mark-to-mark fuel hedge adjustments (23 ) (0.05 ) (8 ) (0.02 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 1,418 $ 3.03 $ 1,467 $ 3.28 Fuel gallons 469 447 Fuel gallons consumed increased 4.9% in line with the increase in departures and capacity, partially offset by a 2.1% improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by ASMs per gallon. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 6.3% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2014 was due to a decrease in average crude oil prices of 5% and a decline in refining margins of 16%, as compared to the prior year. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $41 million in 2014 , compared to losses of $52 million in 2013 . These amounts represent the cash received, or paid, net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance decreased by $18 million , or 7% , compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a $22 million reduction in our power-by-the-hour (PBH) expense, $11 million in lower lease return costs, and five fewer unscheduled engine checks for our Q400 aircraft. Offsetting these decreases was an $11 million increase in engine maintenance expense primarily related to our 737-400 engines, and slightly higher airframe checks for both our 737 and Q400 fleet. The decrease in our PBH expense is due to fewer engines covered by the contracts in the current year, along with reduced flying on the engines that are still under the current contract. The decrease is return costs is due to the four aircraft we returned during the current year and two aircraft we returned at the end of the prior year with no lease return costs expected for lease returns in 2015. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $17 million , or 6% , primarily due to increased flying in 2014 as we increased capacity and entered into new markets. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $20 million , or 11% , primarily due to $15 million increase in contract ramp and passenger handling costs resulting from new stations and rate increases in Seattle. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $20 million , or 11% , compared to 2013 , mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in Seattle and increased credit card commissions from higher revenue. 32 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $24 million , or 9% , due to increased number of aircraft in our fleet. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expenses increased by $9 million , or 11% , due to the increased number of passengers, and more premium product offerings. Third-party regional carrier expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPA agreements, increased $13 million , or 29% , in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase is primarily due to the three additional lines of flying performed by SkyWest in 2014 compared to 2013. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $30 million , or 11% , compared to 2013 . The increase is primarily driven by IT project costs, higher professional fees, and flight crew hotel costs. Special Items In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded special items for $30 million . This is primarily due to a $20 million non-cash curtailment gain related to certain post-retirement benefits that were reduced in 2014. The remaining gain is related to a one-time cash settlement related to a legal matter. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2014 , we recorded nonoperating income of $13 million , compared to an expense of $22 million in 2013 . The $35 million favorable change is due to gains recorded in the current year related to the sale of certain equity securities and reduced interest expense due to lower average debt levels. Additionally, in the prior year, we incurred costs of $12 million to overhaul and repair three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier.

Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. 33 Alaska Mainline Pretax profit for Alaska Mainline was $834 million in 2014 compared to $530 million in 2013 . The $284 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue is described previously. Mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by $124 million , due to increased capacity, departures, expanding to new locations, and higher advertising and promotional activity in Seattle and our new locations. Additionally, we increased spending on IT infrastructure projects, and incurred more depreciation as we continue to purchase aircraft. Economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to a decline in the economic price per gallon, and increased fuel efficiency, slightly offset by an increase in consumption. Alaska Regional Pretax profit for Alaska Regional was $74 million in 2014 compared to $69 million in 2013 . The $28 million increase in Alaska Regional passenger revenue is described previously. The increased Regional revenue was offset by higher expenses to support additional capacity. Additionally, we recorded a $12 million loss in 2013 related to overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $17 million in 2014 compared to $20 million in 2013 . CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) increased due to additional capacity in the state of Alaska. The $8 million increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was driven by increased wages to support additional aircraft in the fleet, higher pilot training costs, and increased depreciation and amortization due to the three additional Q400 aircraft added in Q4 of 2013. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.3 billion , and our expected cash from operations; Our 89 unencumbered aircraft in the operating fleet as of December 31, 2015 , that could be financed, if necessary; Our combined $200 million bank line-of-credit facilities, with none currently outstanding. In 2015 , we took free and clear delivery of 11 B737-900ER aircraft. We made debt payments totaling $116 million . In addition, we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing $505 million of our common stock in 2015 , and paid dividends totaling $102 million . Because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance, we are one of only two airlines in the U.S. with investment grade credit ratings. We will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. The portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives, approved and prohibited investments, and duration and credit quality guidelines. Our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: 34 (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 1,328 $ 1,217 $ 111 Cash, marketable securities, and unused lines of credit as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 28 % 26 % 2 pts Long-term debt, net of current portion 571 686 (115 ) Shareholders equity 2,411 2,127 284 Long-term debt-to-capital ratio (a) 27%:73% 31%:69% (4 ) pts (a) Calculated using the present value of remaining aircraft lease payments for aircraft that are in our operating fleet as of the balance sheet date. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities In 2015 , we generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flows compared to $1.0 billion in 2014 . The increase of $554 million was primarily attributable to improved operating results, driven largely by lower jet fuel costs. Cash provided by operating activities was $1 billion in 2014 , compared to $981 million in 2013 . The $49 million increase is primarily due to an increase in earnings, and an increase in our advance ticket sales, partially offset by a $177 million increase in payments for income taxes. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures and increasing shareholder value through the repurchase of our common stock and dividends. 35 Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $930 million during 2015 , compared to $541 million in 2014 . Our capital expenditures were $831 million , or $137 million higher than in 2014 . This is due to the delivery of 11 B737-900ERs, one Q400 aircraft, and advance purchase deposits on 32 B737 aircraft that will be delivered over the next 24 months. This compares to the delivery of ten B737-900ERs in the prior year. In 2015, we replaced restricted cash on deposit of $52 million with a line of credit facility, resulting in an increase in investing cash flows. As of December 31, 2015 , we had firm commitments for 68 B737 aircraft through 2022 with options to acquire up to 46 additional 737 NextGen (NG) aircraft and MAX aircraft in 2018 through 2024 . We also have firm commitments for two Q400s and options to acquire five Q400 aircraft with deliveries from 2018 to 2019, although we do not currently expect to take delivery of the firm orders or exercise the options. In addition to the five E175 aircraft currently operating in our regional fleet, we have commitments to lease 18 E175 aircraft with start dates in 2016 through 2017 . We also have options to lease eight E175 aircraft with positions starting in late 2017 and early 2018 . The options for all fleet types give us the flexibility, but not the obligation, to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met. Additionally, we may purchase up to 30 regional jets to be operated by Horizon with deliveries starting in 2017. At this time, no order has been placed nor have any commercial terms been agreed upon. The table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised. Additional options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met: 2015 Actuals 2016 2017 2018 2019 Aircraft and aircraft purchase deposits - firm (a)(b) $ 681 $ 450 $ 470 $ 400 $ 345 Other flight equipment 79 40 45 40 40 Other property and equipment 71 150 105 85 85 Total property and equipment additions (c) $ 831 $ 640 $ 620 $ 525 $ 470 Option aircraft and aircraft deposits, if exercised $ $ 65 $ 130 $ 235 $ 350 (a) Excludes contractual payments for two Q400 aircraft in 2018 for which we do not expect to take delivery. (b) We may order 30 regional jets for deliveries over the next several years, for which none of the related expenditures are included in the table above. No commercial terms have been reached, however, if the order is placed in 2016, we would expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $40 million in 2016. (c) 2015 actual capital expenditures include capitalized interest. Future expected capital expenditures exclude capitalized interest and represent only contractual or expected cash outlay for capital assets. Cash used in investing activities was $541 million during 2014, compared to $698 million in 2013. Our capital expenditures were $694 million in 2014, or $128 million higher than in 2013. This is due to the delivery of ten B737-900ER aircraft, the completion of our B737 cabin improvement project, and the exercise of 16 B737 options, two Q400 options, and deposits for an incremental Q400 in 2014. Cash Used by Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $688 million during 2015 , compared to $462 million in 2014 . During the current year, we made debt payments of $116 million , stock repurchases of $505 million , and cash dividend payments of $102 million . In 2014 , we made debt payments of $119 million , stock repurchases of $348 million , and cash dividend payments of $68 million , partially offset by proceeds from debt of $51 million . In 2013, we made debt payments of $161 million and stock repurchases of $159 million . We plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand, internally generated cash from operations, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Lines of Credit The Company has two $100 million credit facilities and a $52 million credit facility. Information about these facilities can be found in Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company has no immediate plans to borrow using any of these facilities. 36 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2015 , we had firm orders to purchase, or lease, 70 aircraft. We also have options to acquire 46 B737 aircraft and options to acquire five Q400 aircraft, although we do not expect to exercise the Q400 options. In addition to the five E175 aircraft currently operated by SkyWest in our regional fleet, we have commitments to lease 18 E175 aircraft with start dates in 2016 and 2017. We have options for eight additional E175 aircraft with positions starting in late 2017 and early 2018 . As mentioned previously, we may order 30 regional jets to be operated by Horizon with deliveries starting in 2017. As no commercial terms have been reached at this time, delivery positions and future capital expenditures are excluded from the fleet table and commitment table below. However, if the order is placed in 2016, we would expect additional capital expenditures of approximately $40 million in 2016. The following table summarizes our projected fleet count by year, as of February 11, 2016 : Actual Fleet Count Expected Fleet Activity (a) Aircraft Dec 31, 2014 Dec 31, 2015 2016 Changes Dec 31, 2016 2017 - 2018 Changes Dec 31, 2018 B737 Freighters & Combis 6 6 6 (3 ) 3 B737 Passenger Aircraft (b) 131 141 3 144 12 156 Total Mainline Fleet 137 147 3 150 9 159 Q400 51 52 52 (15 ) 37 E175 (c) 5 10 15 8 23 CRJ700 (c) 8 8 (8 ) Total Regional Fleet 59 65 2 67 (7 ) 60 Total 196 212 5 217 2 219 (a) The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 are subject to change. (b) 2016 changes include the expected delivery of 19 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft, offset by the return of 13 leased 737-400 aircraft and the removal of three 737-700 aircraft from our operating fleet to be converted into freighter aircraft and return to the fleet in 2017. (c) Aircraft are operated under capacity purchase agreements with a third party. For future firm orders and option exercises, we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash, long-term debt, or lease arrangements. Future Fuel Hedge Positions All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases; and, during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2016 50% $74 $2 Second Quarter 2016 50% $66 $3 Third Quarter 2016 40% $66 $3 Fourth Quarter 2016 30% $65 $3 Full Year 2016 42% $68 $3 First Quarter 2017 20% $60 $3 Second Quarter 2017 10% $58 $3 Full Year 2017 7% $59 $3 37 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2015 . (in millions) 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Beyond 2020 Total Current and long-term debt obligations $ 115 $ 121 $ 151 $ 114 $ 116 $ 69 $ 686 Operating lease commitments (a) 205 192 139 131 119 609 1,395 Aircraft purchase commitments (b) 505 549 444 390 327 418 2,633 Interest obligations (c) 32 27 21 13 7 5 105 Other obligations (d) 71 62 64 68 72 574 911 Total $ 928 $ 951 $ 819 $ 716 $ 641 $ 1,675 $ 5,730 (a) Operating lease commitments generally include aircraft operating leases, airport property and hangar leases, office space, and other equipment leases. Included here are E175 aircraft that are operated by SkyWest under a capacity purchase agreement. (b) Includes payments for two Q400 aircraft deliveries in 2018 that are currently contracted. At this time, however, we do not expect to take delivery of those aircraft. (c) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015 . (d) Includes minimum obligations associated with third-party CPAs with SkyWest and PenAir. Refer to the "Commitments" note in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Defined Benefit Pensions The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, for which there are no minimum required contributions. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $161 million at December 31, 2015 , compared to a $133 million unfunded position at December 31, 2014 . This results in a 92% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 94% funded as of December 31, 2014 . Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. Deferred Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the majority of our assets, as measured by value, are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated, which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices, level of pension funding (which is generally not known until late each year), whether "bonus depreciation" provisions are available, as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control. In 2015 , we made tax payments, net of refunds, totaling $349 million , and had an effective tax rate of 35.4% . We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 38% for 2016 and the effective rate of cash paid for income taxes to be in the range of 30% to 35% of book income, although these estimates are subject to change. We believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A are based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners. We also sell services, including miles for transportation, to non-airline partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies, and a major bank that offers Alaska Airlines affinity credit cards. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our airline partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future. For services sold through one of our non-airline partners, the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered, and the remaining components are recorded as commission in other-net revenue in the period the services are performed. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $280 million , $261 million and $213 million , respectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when the award travel occurs, or the miles expire, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 161 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $814 million . Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in these estimates; therefore, different assumptions could affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold through non-airline partners: We use the relative selling price method for the deferral of sales proceeds. For contracts that were modified after the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force" (ASU 2009-13), we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed. We estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables. This relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables. A 1% shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately $6 million. 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) considers historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. Based on statistical analysis of historical data, our current breakage rate is 17.4%. A hypothetical 1% change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a $7 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award: We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical award redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners, and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flier travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS Our actuarial estimates of pension liability, the related expense, and the associated significant assumptions are discussed in Note 7. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rates to be used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and the interest and service cost. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate used for the obligation increases. We discounted future pension obligations using rates between 4.55% and 4.69% at December 31, 2015 and a rate of 4.20% at December 31, 2014 . The discount rates were determined using current rates earned on high-quality, long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from each of the four defined-benefit pension plans. The discount rates we use are based on a yield curve that uses a pool of higher-yielding bonds estimated to be more in line with settlement rates, as we have taken steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future. If the discount rate decreased by 0.5% , our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 would increase by approximately $128 million and our estimated 2016 pension expense would increase by approximately $8 million . Pension liability and future pension expense can increase or decrease as assumptions in the actuarial data changes. In 2015 , we engaged our third-party actuary to update demographic assumptions used in the valuation of the defined-benefit pension liabilities. These assumptions included updates such as estimated salary increases, employee turnover and retirement rates, among other items. The changes in these assumptions decreased our projected benefit obligation by approximately $50 million at December 31, 2015 . The primary cause of the decline was the change in expected participant retirement rates. The study found that eligible employees are retiring later than they had in our previous assumption update, resulting in lower expected cash flows post retirement. Pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2015 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate long-term rates of return between 6.00% and 6.50% , which compares to 6.5% at December 31, 2014 . We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2015 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed-income securities, and real estate. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 0.5% would increase our estimated 2016 pension expense by approximately $8 million . All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Additionally, benefits in our non-union defined-benefit plans were frozen January 1, 2014. Furthermore, in 2015 , we offered lump sum payments to certain terminated, vested participants in our defined-benefit pension plans in order to eliminate a significant portion of our outstanding liability. As a result, we reduced our projected benefit obligation by $62 million and recorded a settlement charge of $14 million in 2015 , which is included in Special Items on the consolidated statement of operations. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $4.8 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft.
