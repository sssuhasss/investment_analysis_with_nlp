Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: Recent developments . This section provides a general description of recent events and significant developments that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Critical accounting policies . This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Recent accounting pronouncements . This section provides a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures. This section provides a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures which we use in this report. Results of operations . This section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2006 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2005 and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2005 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2004. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources . This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of December 31, 2006. Included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements. Recent Developments Historically, our operations consisted of three business segments based on the services provided by each: financial institution outsourcing, systems and services; health plan management services; and investment support services. As part of our Fiserv 2.0 initiative, we are focused on providing products and services in a more integrated manner. Accordingly, in December 2006, we announced a reorganization of our businesses to provide for a more streamlined structure. The new organization allows us to provide integrated technology-based solutions to each of the three main areas of the insurance industry: health, life, and property and casualty. As a result of this reorganization, we have modified our reporting segments such that our new reporting segments are: Financial Institution Services ( Financial ); Insurance Services ( Insurance ); and Investment Support Services ( Investment ). Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. The majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered. Revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not contain significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the underlying carrying value or reporting unit carrying value to their fair values. As of the most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2006, we determined that the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets do not exceed their respective fair values. We are required to perform this comparison, which involves a number of assumptions, at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. Given the significance of goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements. We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. In addition, we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate long-term debt. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS 123R ), requires companies to expense the value of employee stock option grants and similar awards. We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior periods 20 Table of Contents do not include share-based compensation expense related to SFAS 123R. Share-based compensation expense was $28.5 million and $4.0 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock options, restricted stock and our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the intrinsic value provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ( APB 25 ). Under APB 25, the difference between the quoted market price on the date of grant and the contractual purchase price of shares was recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. As a result, we did not recognize compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for stock options because the exercise price was not less than 100% of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( SFAS 158 ). SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur. The recognition provisions of SFAS 158 became effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this report, we use two non-GAAP financial measures, internal revenue growth percentage and free cash flow. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate our performance, and they are presented in this report because we believe that they are useful to investors in evaluating our financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The methods that we use to calculate non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less acquired revenue from acquisitions divided by total revenues from the prior year plus acquired revenue from acquisitions. Acquired revenue from acquisitions represents pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies, less dispositions, for the prior year. Acquired revenue from acquisitions was $111.3 million ($69.3 million in the Financial segment and $42.1 million in the Insurance segment) and $67.5 million ($44.5 million in the Financial segment and $23.0 million in the Insurance segment) in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it allows them to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth. Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it shows our available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital requirements of our operations. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenues are primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered. Processing and services revenues are most reflective of our core business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; customer support; depreciation; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue is primarily derived from our pharmacy businesses, software license fees and integrated print and electronic communications. A significant amount of product revenue is derived from our pharmacy businesses within the Insurance segment because we include, in both revenues and expenses, the prescription product costs associated with these businesses. We do not manufacture or generally distribute prescription pharmaceuticals, but we are considered to be a principal under Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, as more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we record these revenues and expenses on a gross basis. Prescription product costs included in both product revenues and cost of product were $753.1 million, $540.0 million and $439.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cost of products, in addition to pharmacy product costs, include personnel, infrastructure costs and other costs directly associated with product revenue. We also include customer reimbursements, such as postage and telecommunication costs, in processing and services revenue, product revenue, cost of processing and services, and cost of product in accordance with EITF 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred. These costs, which are pass-through expenses to clients and which are included in both revenues and expenses, were $416.1 million, $351.0 million and $379.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; and other selling and administrative expenses. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues, and the percentage change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Years ended December 31, (In millions) Percentage Years Ended December 31, Percentage Increase 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Revenues: Processing and services $ 3,026.5 $ 2,891.6 $ 2,739.7 67 % 71 % 73 % 5 % 6 % Product 1,517.7 1,167.9 990.0 33 % 29 % 27 % 30 % 18 % Total revenues 4,544.2 4,059.5 3,729.7 100 % 100 % 100 % 12 % 9 % Expenses: Cost of processing and services (1) 1,959.3 1,855.2 1,822.7 65 % 64 % 67 % 6 % 2 % Cost of product (1) 1,251.3 942.7 796.0 82 % 81 % 80 % 33 % 18 % Sub-total (2) 3,210.5 2,798.0 2,618.7 71 % 69 % 70 % 15 % 7 % Selling, general and administrative (2) 589.4 516.1 451.5 13 % 13 % 12 % 14 % 14 % Total expenses (2) 3,799.9 3,314.1 3,070.2 84 % 82 % 82 % 15 % 8 % Operating Income (2) $ 744.3 $ 745.4 $ 659.6 16 % 18 % 18 % 0 % 13 % (1) Each percentage of revenue equals the relevant expense amount divided by the related component of total revenues. (2) Each percentage of revenue equals the relevant expense or operating income amount divided by total revenues. Total Revenues Total revenues increased $484.7 million, or 12%, in 2006 compared to 2005, and $329.7 million, or 9%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The internal revenue growth rate was 9% in 2006 and 7% in 2005 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions. Overall internal revenue growth is primarily derived from sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients and increases in transaction volumes from existing clients. The improvement in the total revenue growth rate for 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to increased prescription revenue from new clients in the Insurance segment pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses. Processing and services revenues increased 5% in 2006 and 6% in 2005 compared to the prior year periods. These increases were driven by sales to new clients, cross-sales to existing clients, increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions. Partially offsetting these increases in 2006 were a $34.5 million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in 2005. Contract termination and assignment fees were $23.4 million, $57.9 million and $36.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Financial segment businesses generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees. These fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired. Product revenues increased 30% in 2006 compared to 2005 and 18% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to new clients in the Insurance segment pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses 23 Table of Contents along with growth in card fulfillment and print services within the output solutions division. The revenue growth in the pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses in the Insurance segment was impacted significantly by the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenues and expenses of $753.1 million, $540.0 million and $439.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $485.8 million, or 15%, in 2006 compared to 2005 and $243.9 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared to 2004. These increases were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues were relatively consistent in 2006 as compared to 2005 and the slight increase from 64% in 2005 to 65% in 2006 was primarily caused by a decrease of $34.5 million in 2006 of higher margin contract termination fee revenue. These fees, which were significantly higher in 2005 than 2006, do not generate substantial incremental cost when received. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenues decreased in 2006 and 2005 from 67% in 2004 due primarily to changes in the mix of our businesses, including acquisitions and the impact of operating efficiencies. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 82% in 2006, 81% in 2005 and 80% in 2004. The increases in cost of product were primarily driven by the significant increase in prescription product costs in 2006 and 2005 as discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses have remained relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006 were negatively impacted by the inclusion of $17.3 million of incremental share-based compensation expense as a result of the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, and $9.0 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending division. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income decreased $1.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and operating margins decreased to 16% in 2006 from 18% in 2005 and 2004. Operating income and margin in 2006, as compared to 2005, was negatively impacted by a $34.5 million decrease in higher margin contract termination fees, a $24.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, operating losses associated with the Australian check processing operations and charges of $9.0 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in the lending division. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating income and margin were increases in higher margin revenues in the electronic payments and flood insurance processing businesses, continued strong operating results in bank and credit union core processing and improvements in overall operating efficiencies. In addition, operating margins in 2006 and 2005 were negatively impacted by the significant revenue growth in the pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits. The negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately 3 percentage points in 2006 and 2005 and 2 percentage points in 2004. Segment Results In connection with organizational changes in 2006, we reclassified our reportable segments for all periods presented to align them with how our chief operating decision maker currently manages the business. As a result, our continuing operations are classified into three business segments: Financial Institution Services ( Financial ); 24 Table of Contents Insurance Services ( Insurance ); and Investment Support Services ( Investment ). The historical business segment information presented below has been restated to conform to our new business segment reporting structure. Years ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) Financial Insurance Investment Total Total revenues: 2006 $ 2,877.4 $ 1,529.6 $ 137.1 $ 4,544.2 2005 2,650.0 1,275.0 134.4 4,059.5 2004 2,451.4 1,152.8 125.5 3,729.7 Operating income: 2006 $ 565.0 $ 154.3 $ 25.0 $ 744.3 2005 581.1 139.2 25.0 745.4 2004 514.1 124.9 20.6 659.6 Operating income growth (decline) (1) : 2006 (3 )% 11 % 0 % 0 % 2005 13 % 12 % 22 % 13 % Operating margin: 2006 20 % 10 % 18 % 16 % 2005 22 % 11 % 19 % 18 % 2004 21 % 11 % 16 % 18 % (1) Represents operating income growth (decline) compared to the prior period. Financial The Financial segment increased total revenues by $227.4 million, or 9%, in 2006 and $198.6 million, or 8%, in 2005. The internal revenue growth rate in the Financial segment was 6% in 2006 and 2005 with the remaining growth in each year resulting from acquisitions. Internal revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased volumes and new clients in the electronic payments and loan settlement services businesses along with new client growth and increased sales in the banking and credit union core processing businesses and card fulfillment businesses. In 2006, internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by a $34.5 million decrease in contract termination fees and the loss of two clients in 2005. In 2005, internal revenue growth was positively impacted by a $21.5 million increase in contract termination fees. Operating margins in the Financial segment were 20% in 2006, 22% in 2005 and 21% in 2004. In comparison to 2005, operating margins in 2006 were negatively impacted by a decrease of $34.5 million in higher margin contract termination fees, an increase of $20.8 million in share-based compensation expense related to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, operating losses associated with the Australian check processing operations and charges totaling $9.0 million related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in the lending division. Partially offsetting these negative factors in 2006 were higher margin revenues in the electronic payments businesses, continued strong operating results in the bank and credit union processing businesses and overall operating efficiencies. Operating margins in 2005 were positively impacted over 2004 primarily by a $21.5 million increase in contract termination fees. Insurance Revenues in the Insurance segment increased $254.6 million, or 20%, in 2006 compared to 2005 and $122.3 million, or 11%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The internal revenue growth rate in this segment was 16% in 2006 and 8% in 2005 with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions. The internal revenue growth rates were primarily driven by the signing of new clients in the pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses. 25 Table of Contents Operating margins in the Insurance segment were 10% in 2006 compared to 11% in 2005 and 2004. Operating margins in 2006 were negatively impacted primarily by the significant increase in revenues in the pharmacy management and workers compensation businesses, which generate operating margins in the low- to mid-single digits, and expenses associated with our consumer-directed health care initiatives. Partially offsetting these factors were higher operating margins in our flood and property and casualty insurance businesses. The inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense negatively impacted operating margins in the Insurance segment by 10 percentage points, 8 percentage points and 7 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment The Investment segment had revenue growth of $2.7 million in 2006 and $8.9 million in 2005 representing revenue growth of 2% and 7%, respectively. Revenue growth in each year was primarily the result of new client growth. Revenue growth in 2006 was lower than 2005 primarily due to a decrease in deposit levels resulting from strong equity markets which negatively impacted investment income and corresponding revenues. Operating margins in the Investment segment were 18% in 2006, 19% in 2005 and 16% in 2004. Operating income and margin in 2006 were negatively impacted by the mix of revenue with a lower level of higher margin investment income as compared to 2005. The increase in operating income and margin in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to a temporary increase in cash investment balances in 2005 that improved net investment income. Discontinued Operations On March 24, 2005, we completed the sale of our securities clearing businesses to Fidelity Global Brokerage Group, Inc. ( Fidelity ) for $344.9 million paid in cash at closing, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Prior to completion of the sale, the securities clearing businesses paid a $68.0 million cash distribution to us. The sales proceeds, net of related expenses, including taxes that became due upon the sale of the securities clearing businesses, approximated the carrying value of this investment. In 2005, we recorded a net loss on the sale of discontinued operations of $0.4 million, net of related income taxes of $48.7 million. The higher income tax expense on the sale of the securities clearing operations was primarily due to a significantly lower tax basis than book basis mainly due to a tax free exchange in our initial purchase of one of the companies that was sold. During 2005, we recorded $0.03 per share in diluted earnings in discontinued operations primarily as a result of favorable resolutions of income tax uncertainties. In 2006, we finalized and recognized a $10.6 million pre-tax gain related to a contingent payment that we received from Fidelity based on the securities clearing businesses achievement of revenue targets established in the stock purchase agreement. We are investigating a matter identified in an indemnification notice delivered pursuant to the stock purchase agreement. The matter relates to the securities clearing businesses past maintenance of certain documentation related to introducing broker dealers customers. We are unable to estimate or predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or to determine whether this matter will have a material adverse impact on the discontinued operations results. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense was $41.0 million, $27.8 million and $24.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $13.2 million increase in interest expense in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding due to acquisitions and additional share repurchases in 2005 and 2006. Interest income was $7.0 million, $13.6 million and $6.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $6.6 million decrease in interest income in 2006 and the $6.9 million increase in interest income in 2005 was primarily due to increased cash balances in 2005 resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses. 26 Table of Contents Realized Gain from Sale of Investments In 2005, we realized a pre-tax gain of $43.5 million, or $0.14 per share after income taxes, from the sale of our remaining ownership of 3.2 million shares of common stock of Bisys Group, Inc. In addition, we sold our investment in INTRIA Items, Inc. to our joint venture partner, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $43.4 million, or $0.15 per share after income taxes. Income Tax Provision The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 37.6% in 2006, 37.5% in 2005 and 38.4% in 2004. The effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were favorably impacted by a number of one-time items compared to 2004 primarily associated with changes in state tax laws, finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments. We expect that the income tax rate for continuing operations will be 38.5% in 2007. Net Income Per Share-Diluted Net income per share-diluted for 2006 was $2.53 compared to $2.70 in 2005 and $1.91 in 2004. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.50 in 2006 compared to $2.68 in 2005 and $2.00 in 2004. Net income per share-diluted in 2006 compared to 2005 was negatively impacted by a decrease of $0.29 per share from realized gains on sale of investments in 2005, approximately $0.12 per share from a decrease in contract termination fees in 2006, $0.09 per share of incremental share-based compensation expense in 2006 due to the prospective adoption of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006 and $0.03 per share related to the write-down of assets and facility shutdown costs in our lending division in 2006. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations for 2005 of $2.68 compared to $2.00 in 2004 was positively impacted by $0.29 per share due to the realized gain on sale of investments in 2005 and approximately $0.07 per share from an increase in contract termination fees in 2005 compared to 2004. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our free cash flow: (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 635.0 $ 601.2 $ 699.0 Capital expenditures (187.5 ) (165.0 ) (161.1 ) Free cash flow $ 447.5 $ 436.2 $ 537.9 Free cash flow increased by $11.3 million in 2006 compared with 2005 and was impacted by a higher level of capital expenditures in 2006. Capital expenditures increased $22.5 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to a series of investments to support future client growth. Free cash flow in 2006 was negatively impacted by lower contract termination fee revenue, after income taxes, of approximately $21 million and $11.2 million due to the treatment of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, which are required by SFAS 123R to be included in cash flows from financing activities instead of operating cash flows as they were in 2005 and prior years. In 2006, we used our free cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program primarily to fund acquisition related payments of $186.7 million and to repurchase 12.7 million shares of our common stock for $560.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, 0.4 million shares of our common stock were available for repurchase under previous authorizations by our board of directors. On January 31, 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares of our common stock. Share repurchases under the existing authorization are expected to be made through open market transactions as market conditions warrant. Shares repurchased have historically been held for issuance in connection with acquisitions and equity plans. Our current policy is to use our free cash flow to support future business opportunities and repurchase shares of our common stock, rather than to pay dividends. 27 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, we had $747.3 million of long-term debt of which $451.8 million was outstanding under our revolving credit and commercial paper facilities. We maintain a $500 million unsecured commercial paper program, which is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Under this program, we may issue commercial paper with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We also maintain a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. We may increase the availability under this facility up to $1.25 billion at our discretion, subject to a number of conditions, including the absence of any default under the credit agreement. The revolving credit facility supports 100% of our outstanding commercial paper. As a result, borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the amount of credit available under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants. Among other requirements, our consolidated indebtedness is limited to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The facility expires on March 24, 2011. We were in compliance with all debt covenants throughout 2006. We believe that our cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to meet our operating requirements, required operating lease payments, required repayments of long-term debt, and expected capital spending needs in 2007. At December 31, 2006, we had $435 million available for borrowing under our credit and commercial paper facilities and $185 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the event that we make significant future acquisitions, we may raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of common shares. Historically, our growth has been accomplished, to a significant degree, through the acquisition of businesses that are complementary to our operations. We believe that a number of acquisition candidates are available that would further enhance our competitive position and we plan to pursue them. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases. Purchase obligations primarily relate to agreements to purchase or license data processing equipment and software.
