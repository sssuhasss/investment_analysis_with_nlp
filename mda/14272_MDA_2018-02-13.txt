Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2017 Form 10-K for terms used throughout the document. In 2017, we received 15 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the U.S., EU, Japan and China) including multiple regulatory milestone achievements for Opdivo . We are committed to investigating Opdivo alone and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents for a wide array of tumor types, including broad programs in lung, head & neck, liver, kidney, bladder and gastric. We continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our IO portfolio positions us well for the future. We have 17 new IO compounds in clinical development and studies across more than 35 different tumor types. In addition, we advanced certain other non-IO R&D programs in our pipeline, including FGF21 for the treatment of NASH and TYK-2 inhibitor for the treatment of immune diseases such as psoriasis. We also continued to progress our company transformation initiatives enabling us to invest in our highest priority portfolio opportunities. In 2017, our revenues increased 7% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by increased competition for established brands, primarily Daklinza . The $2.04 decrease in GAAP EPS was due to tax charges attributed to tax reform ( $1.76 per share) and to a lesser extent higher license, asset acquisition and restructuring related charges and lower divestiture- related income. These items were partially offset by higher revenues, royalties and licensing income and a patent-infringement settlement. After adjusting for the impact of tax reform and other specified items, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.18 primarily as a result of higher revenues partially offset by product mix and higher R&D expenses supporting Opdivo and other IO programs. In 2016, our revenues increased 17% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by the expiration of our U.S. commercialization rights to Abilify *, the transfer of Erbitux * rights in North America and increased competition for Reyataz , Sustiva and Baraclude in certain markets. The $1.72 increase in GAAP EPS was due to higher revenues, divestiture-related income and lower license and asset acquisition charges partially offset by higher Opdivo related expenses. After adjusting for the impact of divestiture gains, R&D license and asset acquisition charges and other specified items, non-GAAP EPS increased by $0.82 primarily as a result of higher revenues partially offset by product mix. Highlights The following table summarizes our financial information: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2017 2016 2015 Total Revenues $ 20,776 $ 19,427 $ 16,560 Diluted Earnings Per Share GAAP 0.61 2.65 0.93 Non-GAAP 3.01 2.83 2.01 Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. For a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 29 Significant Product and Pipeline Approvals The following is a summary of the 15 significant approvals received in 2017 .

Refer to " Product and Pipeline Developments" for all of the developments in our marketed products and late-stage pipeline in 2017 and in early 2018. Strategy Our focus as a specialty biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines that address serious unmet medical needs. Our strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. Our four strategic priorities are to drive business performance, continue to build a leading franchise in IO, maintain a diversified portfolio both within and outside of IO, and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including establishing partnerships, collaborations and in-licensing or acquiring investigational compounds as an essential component of successfully delivering transformational medicines to patients. 30 We are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (1) oncology with a priority in IO; (2) immunoscience with priorities in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease; (3) cardiovascular with a priority in heart disease and; (4) fibrotic disease with priorities in lung and liver. We continue to advance the next wave of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business developments activities. In IO, we continue to invest in monotherapy studies, combination approaches, and our next wave of early assets. We have entered into several collaboration agreements and expanded others to research and develop Opdivo and other approved or investigational oncology agents in combination regimens. We remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of Opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave IO mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory IO patients. Beyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunoscience, cardiovascular, and fibrotic diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. We believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines. Our commercial model has been evolving and revenues from our marketed product portfolio continue to grow which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. We continue to drive growth of Opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data, and is now the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions in the U.S. We are building on the continued success of our other prioritized brands and remain strongly committed to Orencia and Sprycel . Through our operating model transformation, our commercial infrastructure is uniquely leveraged for potential growth. Our operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial and R&D resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthening our R&D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection, and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. The evolution in our operating model will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio. Looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of key brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline, aided by strategic business development, focusing on prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.

(b) Foreign exchange impacts were derived by applying the prior period average currency rates to the current period sales. U.S. revenues increased in 2017 due to higher demand for Eliquis and Opdivo partially offset by lower demand for established brands due to increased competition, primarily Daklinza and HIV brands. The lower growth rate in the U.S. was due to additional competition for Opdivo and Daklinza . Average U.S. net selling prices were approximately 2% higher after charge-backs, rebates and discounts. Refer to " Product Revenues Commentary" for additional information. U.S. revenues increased in 2016 due to higher demand for Opdivo , Eliquis and Daklinza , partially offset by the full year impact of the expiration/transfer of commercialization rights to Abilify* and Erbitux* . Average U.S. net selling prices were approximately 5% higher after charge-backs, rebates and discounts. Europe revenues increased in 2017 due to higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by lower demand for Daklinza due to increased competition. Europe revenues increased in 2016 due to higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by lower demand for Yervoy . Rest of the World revenues decreased in 2017 due to lower demand for established brands, including Daklinza , due to increased competition and out-licensing of a mature brand product, partially offset by higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis . Rest of the World revenues decreased in 2016 due to increased competition for the Hepatitis C Franchise in Japan and unfavorable foreign exchange (primarily Latin America) partially offset by higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis. Other revenues decreased in 2016 as a result of the expiration of certain supply arrangements. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3 . Alliances" for further discussion of the alliances. No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total revenues except for Japan which contributed 10% of total revenues in 2015. 33 GTN Adjustments We recognize revenue net of GTN adjustments that are further described in " Critical Accounting Policies". Our share of certain Abilify* and Atripla* revenues is reflected net of all GTN adjustments in alliance and other revenues. The activities and ending reserve balances for each significant category of GTN adjustments were as follows: Dollars in Millions Charge-Backs and Cash Discounts Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Other Rebates, Returns, Discounts and Adjustments Total Balance at January 1, 2016 $ 97 $ 434 $ 890 $ 1,421 Provision related to sale made in: Current period 1,582 1,438 1,797 4,817 Prior period (56 ) (99 ) (155 ) Payments and returns (1,553 ) (1,296 ) (1,397 ) (4,246 ) Foreign currency translation and other (31 ) (31 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 126 $ 520 $ 1,160 $ 1,806 Provision related to sale made in: Current period 2,087 2,090 2,135 6,312 Prior period (3 ) (4 ) (64 ) (71 ) Payments and returns (2,004 ) (1,810 ) (2,107 ) (5,921 ) Foreign currency translation and other 3 104 107 Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 209 $ 796 $ 1,228 $ 2,233 The reconciliation of gross product sales to net product sales by each significant category of GTN adjustments was as follows (excluding alliance and other revenues such as Abilify* and Atripla* ): Year Ended December 31, % Change Dollars in Millions 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Gross product sales $ 25,499 $ 22,364 $ 17,166 14 % 30 % GTN Adjustments Charge-backs and cash discounts (2,084 ) (1,582 ) (1,043 ) 32 % 52 % Medicaid and Medicare rebates (2,086 ) (1,382 ) (859 ) 51 % 61 % Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments (2,071 ) (1,698 ) (1,219 ) 22 % 39 % Total GTN Adjustments (6,241 ) (4,662 ) (3,121 ) 34 % 49 % Net product sales $ 19,258 $ 17,702 $ 14,045 9 % 26 % GTN adjustments percentage 24 % 21 % 18 % 3 % 3 % U.S. 31 % 26 % 25 % 5 % 1 % Non-U.S. 13 % 13 % 11 % 2 % GTN adjustments are primarily a function of product sales volume, regional and payer channel mix, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates. GTN adjustments are increasing at a higher rate than gross product sales due to higher U.S. Eliquis gross product sales, which has a relatively high GTN adjustment percentage as a result of competitive pressures to maintain its position on healthcare payer formularies allowing patients continued access through their medical plans. 34 Product Revenues Year Ended December 31, % Change Dollars in Millions 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Prioritized Brands Opdivo $ 4,948 $ 3,774 $ 942 31 % ** U.S. 3,102 2,664 823 16 % ** Non-U.S. 1,846 1,110 119 66 % ** Eliquis 4,872 3,343 1,860 46 % 80 % U.S. 2,887 1,963 1,023 47 % 92 % Non-U.S. 1,985 1,380 837 44 % 65 % Orencia 2,479 2,265 1,885 9 % 20 % U.S. 1,704 1,532 1,271 11 % 21 % Non-U.S. 775 733 614 6 % 19 % Sprycel 2,005 1,824 1,620 10 % 13 % U.S. 1,105 969 829 14 % 17 % Non-U.S. 900 855 791 5 % 8 % Yervoy 1,244 1,053 1,126 18 % (6 )% U.S. 908 802 602 13 % 33 % Non-U.S. 336 251 524 34 % (52 )% Empliciti 231 150 3 54 % ** U.S. 151 133 3 14 % ** Non-U.S. 80 17 ** N/A Established Brands Baraclude 1,052 1,192 1,312 (12 )% (9 )% U.S. 53 66 135 (20 )% (51 )% Non-U.S. 999 1,126 1,177 (11 )% (4 )% Sustiva Franchise 729 1,065 1,252 (32 )% (15 )% U.S. 622 901 1,041 (31 )% (13 )% Non-U.S. 107 164 211 (35 )% (22 )% Reyataz Franchise 698 912 1,139 (23 )% (20 )% U.S. 327 484 591 (32 )% (18 )% Non-U.S. 371 428 548 (13 )% (22 )% Hepatitis C Franchise 406 1,578 1,603 (74 )% (2 )% U.S. 109 827 323 (87 )% ** Non-U.S. 297 751 1,280 (60 )% (41 )% Other Brands 2,112 2,271 3,818 (7 )% (41 )% U.S. 390 379 1,547 3 % (76 )% Non-U.S. 1,722 1,892 2,271 (9 )% (17 )% Total Revenues 20,776 19,427 16,560 7 % 17 % U.S. 11,358 10,720 8,188 6 % 31 % Non-U.S. 9,418 8,707 8,372 8 % 4 % ** Change in excess of 100% 35 Opdivo (nivolumab) a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 on T and NKT cells that has been approved for several anti-cancer indications including bladder, blood, colon, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, melanoma and stomach and continues to be investigated across other tumor types and disease areas. U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. We expect increased competition for Opdivo to continue in the future due to new product entrants and expanded indications. International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand as a result of launches of additional indications and approvals in new countries. Eliquis (apixaban) an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, targeted at stroke prevention in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the prevention and treatment of VTE disorders. U.S. and international revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand resulting from increased commercial acceptance of novel oral anticoagulants and market share gains. Orencia (abatacept) a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe active RA and PsA and is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in certain pediatric patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher average net selling prices and demand. International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. Sprycel (dasatinib) an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase and the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including Gleevec* (imatinib meslylate). U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand and average net selling prices. International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. We may experience a decline in European revenues in the event that generic datasinib product enters the market. Yervoy (ipilimumab) a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. U.S. revenues increased in both periods primarily due to higher demand. International revenues increased in 2017 due to higher demand in Europe following the approval of the Opdivo+Yervoy combination therapy for melanoma. International revenues decreased in 2016 due to lower demand resulting from the introduction of other IO products being used to treat patients with melanoma, including Opdivo . Empliciti (elotuzumab) a humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Empliciti was launched in the U.S. in December 2015, in the EU in May 2016 and in Japan in September 2016. Baraclude (entecavir) an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. International revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition. Sustiva (efavirenz) Franchise a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes Sustiva , an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, Atripla*. U.S. revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition from new product entrants. The decrease in 2016 was partially offset by higher average net selling prices. The LOE occurred in December 2017. Gilead terminated BMS's participation in the U.S. and Canada joint venture following the launch of a generic version of Sustiva in the U.S. As a result, BMS's share of Atripla * revenues will further decline during the next three years. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3 . Alliances" for further discussion. Reyataz (atazanavir sulfate) Franchise Includes Reyataz - a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV and Evotaz (atazanavir 300 mg and cobicistat 150 mg) - a combination therapy containing Reyataz and Tybost* (cobicistat). U.S. revenues continued to decrease due to lower demand resulting from new product entrants. The decrease in 2016 was partially offset by higher average net selling prices. The LOE occurred in December 2017 and will result in a higher decline in revenues in future periods due to generic competition. International revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition. The decrease in 2016 was also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. 36 Hepatitis C Franchise Daklinza (daclatasvir) - an NS5A replication complex inhibitor; Sunvepra (asunaprevir) - an NS3 protease inhibitor; and beclabuvir - an NS5B inhibitor. U.S. revenues decreased in 2017 due to lower demand resulting from new product entrants. U.S. revenues increased in 2016 due to the launch of Daklinza in July 2015. International revenues decreased in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition due to new product entrants. Other Brands includes all other brands, including those which have lost exclusivity in major markets, OTC brands and royalty revenue. U.S. revenues decreased in 2016 due to the expiration of BMS's commercialization rights to Abilify* in April 2015 and the transfer of BMS's North American Erbitux* rights to Lilly in October 2015. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3 . Alliances" for further discussion. International revenues decreased in 2017 due to out-licensing and divestiture of certain other brands and continued generic erosion. International revenues decreased in 2016 due to the expiration of certain supply arrangements, divestiture of certain other brands, increased competition for OTC brands and unfavorable foreign exchange. Estimated End-User Demand Pursuant to the SEC Consent Order described under SEC Consent Order , we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for the following products were not material to our results of operations as of the dates indicated. At December 31, 2017, Daklinza had 1.7 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. as a result of minimum required stock levels to support patient demand. We expect inventory on hand levels of Daklinza to exceed one month over the near term. Below are international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2017. Dafalgan , an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to also 1.2 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2017. The level of inventory on hand was primarily attributable to France to support product seasonality. Efferalgan , an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 0.8 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2017. The level of inventory on hand was primarily attributable to France to support product seasonality. Fervex , a cold and flu product, had 3.0 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 4.0 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2017. The level of inventory on hand was attributable to France to support product seasonality. Perfalgan , an analgesic product, had 2.6 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.5 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2017. The level of inventory on hand was primarily in the Gulf Countries due to extended delivery lead time. In the U.S., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 95% of total gross sales of U.S. products. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes. Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2017 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 37 Expenses % Change Dollar in Millions 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Cost of products sold $ 6,066 $ 4,946 $ 3,909 23 % 27 % Marketing, selling and administrative 4,687 4,911 4,841 (5 )% 1 % Research and development 6,411 4,940 5,920 30 % (17 )% Other income (net) (1,519 ) (1,285 ) (187 ) 18 % ** Total Expenses $ 15,645 $ 13,512 $ 14,483 16 % (7 )% ** Change in excess of 100% Cost of products sold Cost of products sold include material, internal labor and overhead costs from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party product supply costs and other supply chain costs managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. Cost of products sold also includes royalties and profit sharing, certain excise taxes, foreign currency hedge settlement gains and losses and the amortization of acquired developed technology costs. Cost of products sold typically vary between periods as a result of product mix and volume (particularly royalties and profit sharing), and to a lesser extent changes in foreign currency, price, inflation and costs attributed to manufacturing site exits. Cost of products sold increased in 2017 due to higher Eliquis profit sharing of $719 million and a $146 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing operations in Swords, Ireland. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, inventory charges, manufacturing startup costs and foreign currency. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures and Licensing Arrangements" for further information. Cost of products sold increased in 2016 due to higher Eliquis profit sharing of $700 million , lower foreign currency hedge settlement gains and higher Puerto Rico excise tax. Marketing, selling and administrative Marketing, selling and administrative expenses primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs, advertising and product promotion. Expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global enabling functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Expenses typically vary between periods due to new product launch promotional activities. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased in 2017 due to lower advertising, promotion and sales-force expenses supporting Daklinza and other established brands and lower BMS foundation grants. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased in 2016 due to higher advertising, promotion and sales-force expenses supporting Opdivo partially offset by lower spend for established brands and favorable foreign exchange. Research and development Research and development activities include discovery research, preclinical and clinical development, drug formulation and medical support of marketed products. Expenses include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and contingent milestone payments for licensing and asset acquisitions of investigational compounds, IPRD impairment charges and proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs. The allocations include facilities, information technology, employee stock compensation costs and other appropriate costs. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Expenses typically vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of license and asset acquisition charges and IPRD impairment charges. Research and development expenses increased in 2017 due to higher license and asset acquisition charges, site exit charges, IPRD impairment charges and expansion of Opdivo and other IO development programs. Research and development expenses decreased in 2016 due to lower license and asset acquisition and IPRD impairment charges, partially offset by the acceleration and expansion of Opdivo development programs. 38 Significant charges included in R&D expense were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2017 2016 2015 IFM $ 311 (a) $ $ CytomX 200 (a) 25 (a) Halozyme 105 (a) Flexus 324 (b) 100 (b) 800 (a) Cardioxyl 100 (b) 167 (a) PsiOxus 50 (a) Ono 40 (a) Padlock 139 (a) Cormorant 35 (a) Nitto Denko 100 (a) Five Prime 350 (a) Promedior 84 (c) Bavarian Nordic 60 (c) uniQure 50 (a) Other 40 168 License and asset acquisition charges 1,130 439 1,679 F-Star Alpha 75 LPA1 Antagonist 160 Other 13 IPRD impairments 75 13 160 Site exit costs 383 83 30 Other 14 Site exit costs and other 383 83 44 Research and development significant charges $ 1,588 $ 535 $ 1,883 (a) Upfront payment (b) Milestone payment (c) Option fee License and asset acquisition charges resulted from strategic transactions to acquire or license certain investigational oncology, cardiovascular, immunoscience and fibrotic disease compounds (or options to acquire or license) as disclosed in " Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements". IPRD impairment charges were related to the discontinued development of an investigational compound which was part of our alliance with F-Star Alpha in 2017 and LPA1 Antagonist Phase II study in 2015. Site exit costs resulted from the expected exit of R&D sites in the U.S. through 2020 primarily due to the reduction in the estimated useful lives of the related assets and an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of a R&D facility in Wallingford, Connecticut. Other income (net) Other income (net) increased in 2017 primarily due to a patent infringement settlement and out-licensing income partially offset by lower divestiture gains and related service fees and higher restructuring and debt redemption charges. Other income (net) increased in 2016 primarily due to divestiture gains and related service fees and royalties and lower debt redemption and litigation charges. 39 Components of other income (net) were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2017 2016 2015 Interest expense $ 196 $ 167 $ 184 Investment income (154 ) (105 ) (101 ) Provision for restructuring 293 109 118 Litigation and other settlements (487 ) 47 159 Equity in net income of affiliates (75 ) (77 ) (83 ) Divestiture gains (164 ) (576 ) (196 ) Royalties and licensing income (1,351 ) (719 ) (383 ) Transition and other service fees (37 ) (238 ) (122 ) Pension charges 162 91 160 Intangible asset impairment 15 13 Equity investment impairment 5 45 Written option adjustment (123 ) Loss on debt redemption 109 180 Other (16 ) (44 ) 7 Other income (net) $ (1,519 ) $ (1,285 ) $ (187 ) Restructuring charges relate to changes to the Company's operating model to drive continued success in the near- and long-term through a more focused investment in commercial opportunities for key brands and markets, a competitive and more agile R&D organization that can accelerate the pipeline, streamline operations and realign manufacturing capabilities that broaden biologics capabilities to reflect the current and future portfolio as well as streamline and simplify our small-molecule supply network. The new operating model is expected to enable the Company to deliver the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in the highest priorities across the Company. Aggregate restructuring charges of $826 million have been incurred in 2017 for all actions including accelerated depreciation and impairment charges resulting from early site exits. Litigation and other settlements include BMS's share of a patent-infringement settlement related to Merck's PD-1 antibody Keytruda* in 2017 as BMS and Ono signed a global patent license agreement with Merck. Merck made an initial payment of $625 million to BMS and Ono, of which BMS received $481 million. Merck is also obligated to pay ongoing royalties on global sales of Keytruda* of 6.5% from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2023, and 2.5% from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. The companies also granted certain rights to each other under their respective patent portfolios pertaining to PD-1. Payments and royalties are shared between BMS and Ono on a 75/25 percent allocation, respectively after adjusting for each parties' legal fees. Divestiture gains relate to additional contingent consideration for the diabetes business in 2017, certain OTC brands and investigational HIV medicines businesses in 2016, and the Mount Vernon, Indiana manufacturing facility, Erbitux* , Ixempra* and certain other OTC product businesses in 2015. Royalties and licensing income include upfront licensing fees from Biogen and Roche in connection with the out-licensing of certain investigational genetically defined disease compounds in 2017, royalties from the Merck patent infringement settlement in 2017 and contingent consideration from the Erbitux* and diabetes business divestitures in 2017, 2016 and 2015, including the transfer of certain royalty rights pertaining to Amylin product sales. Transition and other service fees included fees resulting from the divestiture of the diabetes and investigational HIV medicines businesses. Pension charges consist primarily of settlement charges due to the magnitude of lump sum payments for the principal of the U.S. pension plan. Written option adjustment includes income of $123 million resulting from the change in fair value of the written option liability attributed to the Reckitt alliance in 2015. A loss on debt redemption resulted from the repurchase of certain long-term debt obligations in 2017 and the early redemption of Euro notes and a tender offer for certain other debt securities in 2015. 40 Income Taxes Dollars in Millions 2017 2016 2015 Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 5,131 $ 5,915 $ 2,077 Provision for income taxes 4,156 1,408 446 Effective tax rate 81.0 % 23.8 % 21.5 % New tax reform legislation in the U.S. was enacted on December 22, 2017 known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act). The Act moves from a worldwide tax system to a quasi-territorial tax system and comprises broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) adding a deemed repatriation transition tax on certain foreign earnings and profits; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) including certain income of controlled foreign companies in U.S. taxable income; (5) creating a new minimum tax referred to as a base erosion anti-abuse income tax; (6) limiting certain research-based credits; and (7) eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction. Although many aspects of the Act are not effective until 2018, additional tax expense of $2.9 billion was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon enactment of the Act. The additional expense increased the effective tax rate by 56.7% and included a $2.6 billion one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (including related tax reserves). Those earnings were effectively taxed at a 15.5% rate to the extent that the specified foreign corporations held cash and certain other assets and an 8.0% rate on the remaining earnings and profits. The remaining $ 285 million of additional tax expense included an adjustment to measure net deferred tax assets at the new U.S. tax rate of 21% . The accounting for the reduction of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate is complete. The tax charge for the deemed repatriation tax is incomplete, but was recorded as a provisional amount as we were able to make a reasonable estimate of this tax. The provisional amounts may change when completed in 2018 upon finalizing untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and related cash and certain eligible assets of the specified foreign corporations. The provisional amounts may also change if additional guidance of the relevant tax code is released. Excluding the above transitional impacts related to the Act, the tax impact attributed to non-deductible R&D charges, divestiture transactions and other specified items increased the effective tax rate by 3.3% in 2017, 1.8% in 2016 and 0.3% in 2015. No tax benefits were attributed to the R&D charges incurred in connection with the acquisitions of IFM, Cormorant, Padlock, Cardioxyl, Flexus and the warrant to acquire Promedior. Lower non-deductible goodwill allocated to business divestitures and higher valuation allowances attributed to capital loss carryforwards released in 2015 impacted the effective tax rate in 2015. In addition, the adoption of amended income tax accounting guidance related to share-based payments and the early adoption of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory reduced the effective tax rate by 2.4% in 2017. Earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions, domestic manufacturing deductions and higher U.S. foreign tax credits resulting from the Puerto Rico excise tax attributed to most of the remaining changes in the effective tax rates. Prior to the Act, the effective income tax rate was typically lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to earnings for certain of our manufacturing operations in low tax jurisdictions such as Switzerland, Ireland and Puerto Rico which were indefinitely reinvested. BMS operates under a favorable tax grant in Puerto Rico not scheduled to expire prior to 2023. Although the Company continues to assess the broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, it currently expects no significant net impact of tax reform on the effective tax rate in 2018. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Income Taxes" for further information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, R&D charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third party intellectual property rights, divestiture gains or losses, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges and debt redemption gains or losses, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. 41 Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Most of the remaining $5.2 billion is held primarily in low-tax jurisdictions and is subject to restrictions or withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions. We are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax of $2.6 billion which will be payable over eight years as a result of U.S. tax reform. However, we expect to have more flexibility in accessing cash and future cash that may be generated in foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations and issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. will be sufficient to satisfy our normal cash requirements for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, deemed repatriation transition tax and maturities of long-term debt. Management continuously evaluates the Company capital structure to ensure the Company is financed efficiently, which may result in the repurchase of common stock and debt securities, termination of interest rate swap contracts prior to maturity and issuance of debt securities. The Company repurchased $2.5 billion of common stock in 2017 through accelerated share repurchase agreements, Rule 10b5-1 plans and open market purchases. The stock repurchases were funded by $1.5 billion of new long-term debt and cash. The Company repaid $750 million of long-term debt at maturity and repurchased $337 million of long-term debt in 2017. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements and Note 15. Equity" for further information. We issued commercial paper to fund near-term domestic liquidity requirements during 2017. The average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $389 million at a weighted-average rate of 1.17% during 2017. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.3 billion with $299 million outstanding at December 31, 2017. Dividend payments were $2.6 billion in 2017 and $2.5 billion in both 2016 and 2015. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors. Annual capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion in 2017, $ 1.2 billion in 2016 and $800 million in 2015 and are expected to be approximately $1.0 billion in 2018 and $850 million in 2019. We continue to expand our biologics manufacturing capabilities and other facility-related activities. For example, we are constructing a new large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland that will produce multiple therapies for our growing biologics portfolio when completed in 2019. Our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. Our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 9 . Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for further information. We currently have three separate revolving credit facilities totaling $5.0 billion from a syndicate of lenders. The facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants. Our 364 day $2.0 billion facility expires in March 2018 and our two $1.5 billion facilities were extended to October 2021 and July 2022. Our two $1.5 billion , five-year facilities are extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. No borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 or 2016. Additional regulations in the U.S. could be passed in the future including additional healthcare reform initiatives, further changes to tax laws, additional pricing laws and potential importation restrictions which may reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. We continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain European and other countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts and creditworthiness of our customers. We believe these economic conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. 43 Credit Ratings BMS's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service are A2 and Prime-1, respectively, with a stable rating outlook. BMS's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's are A+ and A-1+, respectively, with a stable rating outlook. BMS's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Fitch are A- and F2, respectively, with a stable rating outlook. Our long-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. Our short-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. Any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally. Cash Flows The following is a discussion of cash flow activities: Dollars in Millions 2017 2016 2015 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 5,275 $ 3,058 $ 2,105 Investing activities (66 ) 1,480 (1,572 ) Financing activities (4,077 ) (2,653 ) (3,624 ) Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. For example, annual employee bonuses are typically paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. In addition, cash collections are impacted by longer payment terms for certain biologic products in the U.S., primarily certain products including Opdivo , Yervoy and Empliciti (120 days to 150 days). The longer payment terms are used to more closely align with the insurance reimbursement timing for physicians and cancer centers following administration to the patients. The $2.2 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the following items in addition to increased sales and the timing of cash collections and payments in the ordinary course of business: Lower income tax payments of approximately $1.5 billion ; Out-licensing proceeds of $470 million related to the Biogen and Roche transactions; and Litigation settlement proceeds of $481 million related to Merck's PD-1 antibody Keytruda* (BMS's share) . Partially offset by: Higher R&D licensing payments of approximately $400 million primarily due to the CytomX, Halozyme and Nitto Denko transactions. Higher contributions to pension plans of approximately $300 million . The $1.0 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the following items in addition to increased sales and the timing of cash collections and payments in the ordinary course of business: The wind-down of the Abilify* alliance in 2015 of approximately $700 million ; and Lower R&D licensing payments of approximately $600 million primarily due to the Five-Prime and Promedior transactions in 2015. Partially offset by: Higher income tax payments of approximately $1.4 billion . 44 Investing Activities Cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures, purchases of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days reduced by proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties) and the sale and maturity of marketable securities. The $1.5 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to: Lower net sales of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days of $745 million which were essentially offset by changes in cash equivalents; Lower business divestiture proceeds of approximately $600 million primarily due to certain OTC brands and investigational HIV medicines businesses in 2016; and Higher asset acquisition payments of approximately $350 million primarily due to the acquisition of IFM in 2017. The $3.1 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to: Higher net sales of marketable securities of approximately $2.1 billion in 2016 which were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents; Lower asset acquisition payments of approximately $800 million primarily due to the acquisition of Flexus in 2015; and Higher business divestiture proceeds of approximately $600 million including royalties and other contingent consideration received subsequent to the divestitures of certain OTC brands and investigational HIV medicines businesses in 2016 and the Mount Vernon, Indiana manufacturing facility, Ixempra * and mature and other OTC product businesses in 2015. Partially offset by: Higher capital expenditures of approximately $400 million . Financing Activities Cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings reduced by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings. The $1.4 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to: Higher repurchase of common stock of $2.2 billion primarily due to the accelerated share repurchase agreements. Partially offset by: Higher net borrowing activity of $880 million primarily to fund the repurchase of common stock. The $1.0 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to: Higher net borrowing activity of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016, primarily due to debt redemptions and reductions in cash overdrafts in 2015. Partially offset by: Repurchase of common stock of approximately $200 million in 2016 (none in 2015). Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Payments due by period for our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 were as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Dollars in Millions Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 987 $ 987 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt 6,835 1,250 750 4,835 Interest on long-term debt (a) 3,083 213 200 192 192 192 2,094 Operating leases 793 141 110 90 75 71 306 Purchase obligations 3,386 1,480 730 499 257 239 181 Uncertain tax positions (b) 69 69 Deemed repatriation transition tax 2,497 102 200 200 200 200 1,595 Total (c) $ 17,650 $ 2,992 $ 2,490 $ 981 $ 724 $ 1,452 $ 9,011 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments and periodic cash settlements of derivatives. (b) Includes only short-term uncertain tax benefits because of uncertainties regarding the timing of resolution. (c) Excludes pension and other liabilities because of uncertainties regarding the timing of resolution. 45 In addition to the above, we are committed to an aggregated $17.0 billion of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $3.1 billion (milestones achieved through Phase III clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $10.4 billion (milestones achieved post Phase III clinical studies). Payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating $3.5 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. We also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3 . Alliances for further information regarding our alliances. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations. SEC Consent Order / FCPA Settlement As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. We have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. We maintain DSAs with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. revenues. Under the current terms of the DSAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 95% of our gross U.S. revenues. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent. In addition, as previously disclosed, in October 2015, the Company reached a civil settlement with the SEC of alleged FCPA violations in which the Company agreed to pay approximately $14.7 million in disgorgement, penalties and interest. As part of the settlement, the Company agreed to a two-year self-monitoring period of reporting to the government which concluded in October 2017. Recently Issued Accounting Standards For recently issued accounting standards, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1 . Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Standards. 46 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and title and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred (generally upon shipment except in certain EU markets which does not occur until delivery of the products to the customer). Revenue is also reduced for GTN sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience. GTN Adjustments The following categories of GTN adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. Refer to Total Revenues for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of GTN sales adjustments. Charge-backs and cash discounts Our U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag). In the U.S. and certain other countries, cash discounts are offered as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed cash discounts (typically within a one month time lag). Medicaid and Medicare rebates Our U.S. business participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability. Rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. We also pay a 50% point of service discount to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services when the Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap ("donut hole"). The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability. Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments Other GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability. 47 Estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the LOE. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model. We defer recognition of revenue until the right of return expires, sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns is developed in limited circumstances, or when insufficient historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic area, distribution method or other characteristic is available. This typically occurs when the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or when historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category is lacking. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand are also considered in estimating sales returns for new products. Use of information from external sources Information from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information. Retirement Benefits Accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans requires actuarial valuations based on significant assumptions for discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, these significant assumptions and others such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, healthcare trends and mortality rates are evaluated and selected based on expectations or actual experience during each remeasurement date. Pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. The yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate. The Citi Pension Discount curve is used for the U.S. plans. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2017 for the U.S. pension plans was determined using a 3.5% discount rate. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. pension plans projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 was reduced by an additional 1%, the projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $950 million. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated considering expected returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2017 was determined using a 7.8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2017 was reduced by 1%, such expense would increase by $40 million. For a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 16 . Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities. Business Combinations and Divestitures Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions were $8.1 billion (representing 24% of total assets) at December 31, 2017 . 48 Accounting for transactions as business combinations and divestitures is significantly different than asset acquisitions and divestitures. For example, acquired IPRD is capitalized for business combinations and expensed for asset acquisitions and the fair value of contingent consideration and goodwill are only recognized in business combination transactions. Likewise, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is divested, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying value of the business in determining the gain or loss. Derecognition of goodwill does not occur in asset dispositions. As a result, it is important to determine whether a business or an asset or group of assets is acquired or divested. A business is defined in ASC 805 - Business Combinations as an integrated set of inputs and processes that are capable of generating outputs that have the ability to provide a return to its investors or owners. Typical inputs include long-lived assets (including intangible assets or rights to use long-lived assets), intellectual property and the ability to obtain access to required resources. Typical processes include strategic, operational and resource management processes that are typically documented or evident through an organized workforce. We consider all of the above factors when determining whether a business was acquired (or divested) as well as the compound's development phase if no commercial products are involved. For example, in evaluating our acquisitions of IFM, Cormorant, Padlock, Cardioxyl and Flexus during the past three years, we concluded that no significant processes were transferred to us, thus the transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. As a result, the amounts allocated to the lead investigational compounds were expensed and not capitalized. In addition, contingent consideration from potential development, regulatory, approval and sales-based milestones and sales-based royalties were not included in the purchase price. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4 . Acquisitions and Divestitures" for further discussion on our acquisitions. Similarly, in evaluating divestitures of our small molecule manufacturing operations in Swords, Ireland, investigational HIV medicines business, the businesses comprising the alliance with Reckitt, the Medicines Company, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., Erbitux* and Ixempra* , we concluded that all necessary inputs and processes were transferred, and consequently the transactions were accounted for as sales of businesses, which resulted in the allocation of goodwill ( $12 million in 2017, $98 million in 2016 and $73 million in 2015) to the carrying value of the businesses in determining the gain on sale. Contingent proceeds related to divestitures were not recognized until realized. We also concluded that not all inputs and significant processes to be capable of generating outputs were transferred in our out-licensing arrangements with Biogen and Roche, and consequently these transactions were not accounted for as sales of businesses in 2017. Long-lived Assets Other Intangible Assets, including IPRD Other intangible assets were $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , including licenses ( $254 million of which $152 million is allocated to unapproved products), developed technology rights ( $565 million ), capitalized software ( $359 million ) and IPRD ( $32 million ). Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances warrant a review, although IPRD is assessed at least annually. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected LOE, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. Considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, impairment charges are likely to occur in future periods. We recognized a $75 million charge in 2017 for F-Star Alpha's FS102 which was in Phase I development for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer and $160 million in 2015 for BMS-986020 which was in Phase II development for treatment of IPF. For discussion on IPRD impairments, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 13 . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." 49 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances require a review including whether it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of prior to its estimated remaining useful life. Additionally, these long-lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any change in facts or circumstances would result in a change to the estimated useful life of the asset, possibly resulting in the acceleration of depreciation. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. Expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. The divestiture of our small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing operations in Swords, Ireland and sale of our R&D facility in Wallingford, Connecticut, resulted in $146 million and $79 million in impairment charges, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of assets held-for-sale to their fair value in 2017. Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other related charges for certain manufacturing and R&D facilities were $533 million in 2017 , $104 million in 2016 and $115 million in 2015 . Additional charges will continue to occur as a result of the Company restructuring actions announced in the fourth quarter of 2016. Assets Held-for-Sale The following criteria is considered before concluding assets are classified as held-for-sale; 1) management commitment to a plan to sell, 2) availability for immediate sale in its present condition, 3) initiation of an active program to identify a buyer, 4) probability of a completed sale within one year, 5) actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and 6) likelihood of significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. If all of the criteria is met as of the balance sheet date, the net assets are presented separately in the balance sheet as held-for-sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and is no longer depreciated or amortized while classified as held-for-sale. For example, in evaluating the divestitures of our small molecule manufacturing operations in Swords, Ireland and our sale of our R&D facility in Wallingford, Connecticut, we concluded that all the necessary held-for-sale criteria were met in 2017 in a quarterly period prior to the completed sale. In evaluating the divestitures of the investigational HIV medicines business, the businesses comprising the alliances with Reckitt and Lilly, we concluded that all the necessary held-for-sale criteria were met in 2015. Income Taxes Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017 (net of valuation allowances of $2.8 billion ) and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2016 (net of valuation allowances of $3.1 billion ). The U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards were $317 million at December 31, 2017 . These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2018 (certain amounts have unlimited lives). As discussed more fully in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A, tax charges attributed to the one-time deemed repatriation tax on certain foreign earnings of $2.6 billion were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. The accounting for this income tax effect of the Act was incomplete as of the issuance date of the financial statements as we did not have all of the necessary information available, prepared and analyzed to complete the accounting. However, we were able to make a reasonable estimate of this tax, which was recorded as a provisional amount. The provisional amount may change when completed in 2018 upon finalizing the 2017 taxable income, untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and related cash and certain eligible assets of the specified foreign corporations. The provisional amounts may also change if additional interpretations of the relevant tax code are released. Prior to the Mead Johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and; (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions. 50 Certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value. In addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (ELA) existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009. We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the IPO and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. Mead Johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson stock or assets. Liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. For discussions on income taxes, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1 . Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Note 7 . Income Taxes. Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on contingencies, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1 . Accounting Policies Contingencies, Note 7 . Income Taxes and Note 18 . Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Product and Pipeline Developments Our R&D programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. Our late stage R&D programs in Phase III development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. Spending on these programs represent approximately 30-45% of our annual R&D expenses in the last three years. Opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented greater than 10% of our R&D expenses in the last three years. Our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. The following are the developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline: 51 Product Indication Date Developments Opdivo Biliary Tract Cancer April 2017 BMS and Ono announced Opdivo was designated for the treatment of biliary tract cancer under the Sakigake Designation System in Japan, which offers priority consultation and review. cHL December 2017 BMS and Seattle Genetics, Inc. highlighted an updated interim results from the Phase I/II study evaluating Opdivo and Adcetris * in relapsed/refractory cHL.

Melanoma June 2017 Announced efficacy data from CheckMate-204, a Phase II study evaluating Opdivo+Yervoy as a potential treatment for patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain. April 2017 Announced overall survival data from CheckMate-067, a Phase III study evaluating Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma. MPM June 2017 Announced results from the IFCT-1501 MAPS-2 study evaluating Opdivo or Opdivo combined with Yervoy for previously treated unresectable MPM patients. NSCLC February 2018 Announced that the pivotal Phase III CheckMate-227 study demonstrated superior progression-free survival with the combination of Opdivo + Yervoy versus chemotherapy in first-line NSCLC patients with high tumor mutation burden, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The study will continue as planned to assess the Opdivo + Yervoy combination for the co-primary endpoint of overall survival in patients who express PD-L1. RCC December 2017 Announced FDA accepted the Company's sBLA's for priority review of Opdivo + Yervoy to treat intermediate and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC. The FDA action date is April 16, 2018. In November, announced results from a new exploratory analysis of PD-L1 expression subgroups of the Phase III CheckMate-214 study evaluating Opdivo + Yervo y vs. the standard of care, sunitinib, in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. November 2017 Announced the EMA validated its type II variation application, which seeks to expand the current indications for Opdivo+Yervoy to include the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced RCC. September 2017 Announced CheckMate-214, a Phase III study evaluating Opdivo + Yervoy versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC, met its co-primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. The combination also met a secondary endpoint of improved overall survival in all randomized patients. Based on a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee has recommended that the study be stopped early. August 2017 Announced topline results from CheckMate-214. The combination of Opdivo+Yervoy met the co-primary endpoint of objective response rate and was favored in the co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival, however, it did not reach statistical significance. July 2017 BMS and Exelixis, Inc. announced the initiation of the Phase III CheckMate 9ER study to evaluate Opdivo in combination with Cabometyx * (cabozantinib), Exelixis's small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, or Opdivo and Yervoy in combination with Cabometyx * versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. SCLC October 2017 Announced data evaluating Opdivo and Opdivo + Yervoy in previously treated SCLC patients whose tumors were evaluable for tumor mutation burden from the Phase I/II CheckMate-032 study. Various February 2017 BMS and Exelixis announced a clinical development collaboration to evaluate Cabometyx * with Opdivo , either alone or in combination with Yervoy . The agreement is expected to include a Phase III study in first-line RCC with additional studies planned in bladder cancer, HCC and potentially other tumor types. 53 Eliquis NVAF August 2017 Announced results from a real-world data analysis of the U.S. Humana database, in which treatment with Eliquis was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke/systemic embolism and lower rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin in patients aged 65 years and older with NVAF. Announced data from EMANATE, a Phase IV study, exploring the safety and efficacy of Eliquis in patients with NVAF undergoing cardioversion. Announced results from a real-world data analysis pooled from four large U.S. insurance claims databases, in which treatment with Eliquis was associated with a lower risk of stroke/systemic embolism and lower rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin for the overall population and for each of the selected high-risk patient sub-populations. March 2017 Announced findings from a real-world data analysis of the U.S. Medicare database comparing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism and rate of major bleeding among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who were treated with direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin. Orencia PsA July 2017 EC approval for the treatment of active PsA in adults for whom the response to previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy, including methotrexate, has been inadequate, and additional systemic therapy for psoriatic skin lesions is not required. FDA approval for active PsA in adults, a chronic, inflammatory disease that can affect both the skin and musculoskeletal system. JIA March 2017 FDA approval of a new subcutaneous administration option for use in patients two years of age and older with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA.
