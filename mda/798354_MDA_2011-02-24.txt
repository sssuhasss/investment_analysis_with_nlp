Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: Overview . This section contains background information on our company and the services and products that we provide, our enterprise priorities, and the business challenges and trends facing our industry in order to provide context for management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies . This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Results of operations . This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2010 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2009, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2008. Liquidity and capital resources . This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2010. 20 Table of Contents Overview Company Background We provide financial services technology solutions, including electronic commerce systems and services such as transaction processing, electronic bill payment and presentment, business process outsourcing, document distribution services, and software and systems solutions. We serve approximately 16,000 clients worldwide including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transaction fees under contracts with terms ranging from three to five years, and we benefit from high contract renewal rates with our existing clients. The majority of the services we provide to our clients are non-discretionary in nature and are necessary for them to operate their business. Our operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment, the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment, and the Corporate and Other segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services and debit and other card-based payment products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry. The businesses in this segment also provide Internet banking, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. Industry Trends Market conditions and volatility over the past two years have created a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the United States and internationally. As a result, financial institutions have exercised caution in their information technology spending. Despite this challenging environment, in 2010, our revenue was $4.1 billion, net income per share from continuing operations was $3.34, and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $958 million which increased 1%, 10% and 13%, respectively, as compared to 2009. We believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. We believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that can help them win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions. In each of 2010 and 2009, approximately 1% of all financial institutions in the United States failed or were subject to government action, which has resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients. However, we believe that the number of government actions in 2011 will decline slightly as compared to 2010. The increase in bank failures and forced consolidations during the past two years has been, to some extent, offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions. A consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform, or elects to move to one of our platforms, and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected. Consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. These fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action. In addition, new legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, will result in numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry, although it is too early to determine what impact this complex legislation will have on us or our clients. 21 Table of Contents Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions which enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating through innovation in our products and services. Based on our financial results and our focus on growth and innovation in 2010, we believe we achieved our enterprise priorities for the year. With respect to 2011, our three key enterprise priorities are: (i) to deliver an increased level of high quality revenue growth and increase our earnings per share as compared to 2010; (ii) to further center the Fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions; and (iii) to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. Business Developments Despite the challenges facing the financial industry, we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments, including ZashPay, our person-to-person payment service; account processing, including Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Accounting guidance requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the 22 Table of Contents appropriateness of our fair value measurements. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2010 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2010, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. We use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2010 represented 83% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. 23 Table of Contents Product Product revenue, which in 2010 represented 17% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production (12%) and software licenses (5%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Prior to our sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in our Insurance segment ( Fiserv Insurance, which is now owned and operated by StoneRiver Group, L.P., or StoneRiver ) on July 14, 2008, product revenue and cost of product also included prescription related items which were recognized on a gross basis. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. Financial Results The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Percentage of Revenue (1) Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Revenue: Processing and services $ 3,415 $ 3,329 $ 3,464 82.6 % 81.7 % 75.5 % $ 86 3 % $ (135 ) (4 %) Product 718 748 1,123 17.4 % 18.3 % 24.5 % (30 ) (4 %) (375 ) (33 %) Total revenue 4,133 4,077 4,587 100 % 100 % 100 % 56 1 % (510 ) (11 %) Expenses: Cost of processing and services 1,853 1,844 1,949 54.3 % 55.4 % 56.3 % 9 (105 ) (5 %) Cost of product 533 536 917 74.2 % 71.7 % 81.7 % (3 ) (1 %) (381 ) (42 %) Sub-total 2,386 2,380 2,866 57.7 % 58.4 % 62.5 % 6 (486 ) (17 %) Selling, general and administrative 740 751 813 17.9 % 18.4 % 17.7 % (11 ) (1 %) (62 ) (8 %) Total expenses 3,126 3,131 3,679 75.6 % 76.8 % 80.2 % (5 ) (548 ) (15 %) Operating income 1,007 946 908 24.4 % 23.2 % 19.8 % 61 6 % 38 4 % Interest expense (198 ) (220 ) (260 ) (4.8 %) (5.4 %) (5.7 %) (22 ) (10 %) (40 ) (15 %) Interest income 10 8 13 0.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 % 2 25 % (5 ) (38 %) Loss on early debt extinguishment (26 ) (0.6 %) 26 Loss on sale of businesses (21 ) (0.5 %) (21 ) (100 %) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate $ 793 $ 734 $ 640 19.2 % 18.0 % 14.0 % $ 59 8 % $ 94 15 % (1) Percentage of revenue is calculated as the relevant revenue, expense, income or loss amount divided by total revenue, except for cost of processing and services and cost of product amounts which are divided by the related component of revenue. 24 Table of Contents Total Revenue Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Payments Financial Insurance Corporate and Other Total Total revenue: 2010 $ 2,208 $ 1,951 $ $ (26 ) $ 4,133 2009 2,160 1,942 (25 ) 4,077 2008 2,131 1,992 513 (49 ) 4,587 2010 Revenue growth $ 48 $ 9 $ (1 ) $ 56 2010 Revenue growth percentage 2 % 1 % 2009 Revenue growth (decline) $ 29 $ (50 ) $ (513 ) $ 24 $ (510 ) 2009 Revenue growth (decline) percentage 1 % (3 %) (100 %) (11 %) Total revenue increased $56 million, or 1%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and decreased $510 million, or 11%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in total revenue during 2010 was primarily due to 2% revenue growth in our Payments segment and included a 0.5% increase in revenue in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2009. The decrease in total revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease of $513 million, or 11%. As a result of this transaction, the revenue of Fiserv Insurance is no longer included in our consolidated revenue beginning July 15, 2008. In addition, 2009 revenue was impacted by a 1% increase in revenue in our Payments segment and a 3% decline in revenue in our Financial segment. Incremental revenue from acquired companies was $3 million and $27 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $48 million, or 2%, in 2010 and increased $29 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to the prior year periods. Revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2010 and 2009 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $58 million, or 4%, and $37 million, or 2%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. This growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our electronic payments businesses, including our electronic banking and electronic funds transfer businesses. Payments segment revenue growth in 2010 was partially offset by lower product revenue, which decreased $10 million, or 2%, as compared to 2009, due to lower revenue in our output solutions business, primarily in the first quarter of 2010. In 2009, Payments segment revenue growth was partially offset by revenue declines in our investment services business from a reduction in the number of accounts processed as a result of the volatility in the U.S. equity markets at that time and a decline in product revenue due primarily to lower software license revenue. Revenue in our Financial segment increased $9 million, or 0.5%, in 2010 and decreased $50 million, or 3%, in 2009 compared to the prior year periods. Revenue growth in our Financial segment during 2010 was favorably impacted by a $31 million, or 2%, increase in processing and services revenue due primarily to increased revenue in our bank and credit union account processing businesses and higher contract termination fee revenue, and was negatively impacted by volume declines in our check processing business which we expect will continue in 2011, decreased revenue in our mortgage lending business, and lower software license revenue. In 2009, Financial segment revenue was negatively impacted by a $35 million decrease in contract termination fee revenue and a decline in check processing revenue. Total Expenses Total expenses decreased $5 million, or 0.2%, in 2010 compared to 2009, notwithstanding an increase in revenue in 2010, primarily due to increased operating leverage and effective management of our overall cost structure. The decrease in total expenses in 2009 of $548 million, or 15%, compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease in total expenses of $469 million, or 13%. 25 Table of Contents Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 54.3% in 2010 from 55.4% in 2009 and 56.3% in 2008. The decreases in 2010 and 2009, which had a positive overall impact on our operating margin, were favorably impacted by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, operating efficiency initiatives across the company, and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 74.2% in 2010 compared to 71.7% in 2009 and 81.7% in 2008. Cost of product was relatively unchanged in 2010 compared to 2009; however, cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased in 2010 due primarily to a decline in higher margin project revenue in our output solutions business and lower software license revenue. In 2008, the higher percentage of product revenue was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated historical overall operating margins of less than 10% primarily due to the inclusion of prescription product costs, which totaled $312 million in 2008, in both product revenue and cost of product. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $11 million, or 1%, and $62 million, or 8%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower employee severance expenses. The decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease of $36 million from our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance and lower integration expenses associated with our acquisition of CheckFree Corporation ( CheckFree ). Operating Income and Operating Margin Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Payments Financial Insurance Corporate and Other Total Operating income: 2010 $ 625 $ 591 $ (209 ) $ 1,007 2009 617 569 (240 ) 946 2008 579 545 $ 44 (260 ) 908 Operating income growth (decline): 2010 $ 8 $ 22 $ 31 $ 61 2010 percentage 1 % 4 % 6 % 2009 $ 38 $ 24 $ (44 ) $ 20 $ 38 2009 percentage 7 % 4 % 4 % Operating margin: 2010 28.3 % 30.3 % 24.4 % 2009 28.6 % 29.3 % 23.2 % 2008 27.2 % 27.4 % 8.7 % 19.8 % Operating margin growth (decline): (1) 2010 (0.3 %) 1.0 % 1.2 % 2009 1.4 % 1.9 % 3.4 % (1) Represents the percentage point improvement or decline in operating margin. Total operating income increased $61 million, or 6%, and $38 million, or 4%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Operating margin increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 23.2% in 2009 and 19.8% in 2008. The operating margin improvements of 120 basis points and 340 basis points in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were due in part to our continuing operational effectiveness activities and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. In addition, the increase in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree and the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated lower operating margins, partially offset by a decrease in higher-margin contract termination fees. 26 Table of Contents Operating income in our Payments segment increased $8 million, or 1%, and $38 million, or 7%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 28.3%, 28.6% and 27.2% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and decreased 30 basis points in 2010 and increased 140 basis points in 2009. Payments segment operating income and margin in 2010 compared to 2009 were impacted by increased expenses associated with the development and support of new and existing products and services which we expect to enhance our long term revenue growth, partially offset by increased operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing electronic payments businesses. The increases in operating income and margin in 2009 compared to 2008 were primarily due to cost savings associated with the integration of CheckFree and improved operating leverage in our electronic payments businesses, partially offset by a decline in higher-margin software license revenue. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $22 million, or 4%, and $24 million, or 4%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 30.3%, 29.3% and 27.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and increased 100 basis points in 2010 and 190 basis points in 2009. These improvements in operating income and operating margin were primarily due to revenue growth in 2010 and scale and cost efficiencies in our bank and credit union account processing businesses. In addition, operating income and margin were positively impacted by an increase in higher-margin contract termination fee revenue in 2010 and negatively impacted by a decline in contract termination fee revenue in 2009. The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment decreased $31 million and $20 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. The operating loss decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a $21 million decrease in employee severance expenses and lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. The operating loss decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower expenses, primarily related to our acquisition of CheckFree. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $22 million, or 10%, and $40 million, or 15%, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to the continued reduction in total outstanding borrowings in 2010 and 2009. In addition, interest expense in 2010 was lower than 2009 due to the positive impact of interest rate hedge contracts that expired at the end of 2009. Interest Income Interest income was $10 million, $8 million and $13 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income in 2008 was higher than 2010 and 2009 due primarily to interest income earned from investing the proceeds of our business dispositions. Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In September 2010, we issued $750 million of senior notes in a public offering with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 4.0%. In October 2010, we used a portion of the proceeds from the senior notes offering to purchase $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $26 million. Loss on Sale of Businesses In 2008, we recognized a $21 million pre-tax loss due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. 27 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 38.0% in 2010, 37.2% in 2009, and 44.9% in 2008. The higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was due primarily to income taxes associated with our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. In addition, our effective income tax rate in 2009 includes the positive impact of a tax settlement. The significant items impacting our effective income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Statutory federal, state and foreign income tax provisions, net 38.0 % 38.1 % 38.3 % Sale of Fiserv Insurance (1) 6.6 % Tax settlement (2) (0.9 %) Effective income tax rate 38.0 % 37.2 % 44.9 % (1) Represents a $34 million income tax provision related to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. (2) Represents a $7 million income tax benefit recognized in conjunction with the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting income tax reserve. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate We record our 49% share of StoneRiver net income, $14 million, $12 million and $6 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations totaled $(10) million, $3 million and $211 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we recognized after-tax gains from the sale of businesses of $25 million and $229 million, respectively. Net Income Per Share Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $3.34 in 2010 compared to $3.04 in 2009 and $2.20 in 2008. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2010, partially offset by an $0.11 per share loss on early debt extinguishment. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2009, a $0.34 per share after-tax loss on the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance recognized in 2008, and a $0.14 per share decrease in merger related expenses in 2009 associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.60, $0.58 and $0.57 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 of $563 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $971 million at December 31, 2010. Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2010 2009 $ % Income from continuing operations $ 506 $ 473 $ 33 Depreciation and amortization 339 333 6 Share-based compensation 39 36 3 Loss on early debt extinguishment 26 26 Dividend from unconsolidated affiliate 40 40 Net changes in working capital and other 8 8 Operating cash flow $ 958 $ 850 $ 108 13 % Capital expenditures $ 175 $ 198 $ (23 ) (12 %) Our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, or operating cash flow, increased $108 million, or 13%, to $958 million in 2010 from $850 million in 2009. Our operating cash flow in 2010 included a $40 million dividend from StoneRiver, of which we own 49%, that we do not expect to recur on an annual basis. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures of $175 million and $198 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, were less than 5% of our total revenue in each year. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received $89 million from StoneRiver, of which we own 49%, comprised of a $61 million dividend and a $28 million repayment of a loan. The portion of this dividend that represented a return on our investment, $40 million, is reported in cash flows from operating activities. Share Repurchases We purchased $413 million, $175 million and $441 million of our common stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

We used the proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of our senior term loan borrowings and, as described below, to repurchase a 29 Table of Contents portion of our senior notes due in 2012. In 2010, our debt repayments, net of the $750 million senior notes offering, totaled $285 million. In addition, we paid $26 million of premium and other costs associated with the repurchase of the senior notes. At December 31, 2010, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $1.1 billion senior term loan borrowings and $2.25 billion of senior notes. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2010. Senior Term Loan In December 2007, we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. Term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate and mature in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 0.9% at December 31, 2010. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. Senior Notes In September 2010, we issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and $450 million of 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 commencing on April 1, 2011. Our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to create or assume liens; and our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Tender Offer to Purchase Senior Notes In October 2010, we purchased $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 for $276 million including the premium paid and other costs associated with the transaction. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2010, we entered into a new $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks and terminated our then existing $900 million revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in March 2011. Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, (i) to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and (ii) to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The facility expires in September 2014. As of December 31, 2010, we issued letters of credit totaling $29 million under the new facility, and had available borrowings of $971 million. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts We maintain interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) with total notional values of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Additionally, in 2010, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements ( Forward-Starting Swaps ) with total notional values of $200 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings. The Swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan 30 Table of Contents borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.0%, prior to financing spreads and related fees, and have expiration dates through September 2012. The Forward-Starting Swaps, which expire in September 2012, effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted five-year and ten-year borrowings at weighted-average rates of approximately 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively. Shelf Registration Statement In 2010, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2010, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0% above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
