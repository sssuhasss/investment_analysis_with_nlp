Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General . Grainger is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions. Grainger operations are primarily in the United States and Canada, with an expanding presence in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, catalogs and direct marketing materials and eCommerce. Grainger serves approximately 2 million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers, multiple websites and export services. Grainger two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger U.S. operating segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands Grainger Inc., Grainger Canadian operating segment. Other Businesses include operations in Europe, Asia, Latin America and other U.S. operations, which are not material individually. Business Environment . Several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape Grainger business environment. The overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting Grainger growth. Grainger sales tend to correlate with Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Industrial Production, Exports, Business Investment, Business Inventory for the United States and Oil prices for Canada. The table below provides these estimated indicators for 2012 and 2013: United States Canada Estimated 2012 Forecasted 2013 Estimated 2012 Forecasted 2013 GDP 2.2% 1.9% 1.9% 1.6% Industrial Production 3.7% 2.4% 0.5% 0.3% Exports 3.2% 2.4% 3.4% 3.5% Business Investment 7.7% 3.8% 5.4% 4.4% Business Inventory 2.5% 2.2% Oil prices $102/barrel $95/barrel Source: Global Insight (February 2013) The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported the GDP (advance estimate released on January 30, 2013) decreased at an annual rate of 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Grainger's results reflected this as sales growth slowed in the fourth quarter, particularly with a sudden decrease in sales the last third of December. Sequentially, Grainger's sales growth declined in each of the four quarters of 2012. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 27% of Grainger total 2012 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States increased approximately 1.5% from December 2011 to December 2012 , while manufacturing output increased 1.5% . These increases contributed to a low double-digit percent increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a high single-digit percent increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2012 . Outlook . During 2013, Grainger plans to continue to make investments in growth drivers such as sales force and product line expansion, eCommerce, inventory management services and international expansion. While indicators on a macro basis point to a softer economy in 2013, Grainger believes it will continue to outperform these metrics. On January 24, 2013, Grainger reiterated the 2013 earnings per share guidance of $10.85 to $12.00 and raised the 2013 sales guidance to a new range of 3 to 9 percent growth. Grainger's previous 2013 sales guidance was 2 to 8 percent growth issued on November 14, 2012. The increase in sales guidance reflects the December 31, 2012, acquisition of Techni-Tool, Inc., which had sales of $88 million in 2011. 12 Matters Affecting Comparability . There were 255 sales days in 2012 , 255 in 2011 and 254 in 2010 . Grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2012 and 2011 , all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. Grainger operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates. Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 10.8 % 12.5 % Cost of merchandise sold 56.2 56.5 58.2 10.2 9.4 Gross profit 43.8 43.5 41.8 11.5 16.8 Operating expenses 31.2 30.5 29.9 13.3 14.6 Operating earnings 12.6 13.0 11.9 7.5 22.3 Other income (expense) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (86.5 ) Income taxes 4.7 4.8 4.7 8.8 13.2 Noncontrolling interest 0.1 0.1 12.3 194.0 Net earnings attributable to W.W. Grainger, Inc. 7.7 % 8.1 % 7.1 % 4.8 % 28.9 % 2012 Compared to 2011 Grainger's net sales of $ 8,950 million for 2012 increased 11% when compared with net sales of $8,078 million for 2011 . The 11% daily increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 6% Business acquisitions 3% Price 3% Foreign exchange (1)% Total 11% Sales to all customer end-markets increased for 2012 . The increase in net sales was led by growth in sales to heavy and light manufacturing customers, followed by diversified commercial services customers. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $ 3,916 million for 2012 increased 12% . The gross profit margin for 2012 was 43.8% , up 0.3 percentage points versus 2011 , primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by customer mix. Operating expenses of $ 2,785 million for 2012 increased 13% from $ 2,458 million for 2011 . Operating expenses in 2012 included a $76 million expense related to the settlement of disputes involving the GSA and USPS contracts . Also included was $24 million of expense related to branch closure costs, restructuring charges related to improving the long-term performance of the businesses in Europe, India and China and an impairment charge for Grainger Lighting Services (formerly known as Alliance Energy Solutions), an acquisition completed in November 2009. The year 2011 included $18 million of branch closure costs. Excluding these expenses from both years, operating expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by the Fabory and AnFreixo acquisitions and incremental growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising, primarily in the United States. 13 Operating earnings of $ 1,131 million for 2012 increased 7% from $ 1,052 million for 2011 . Excluding the expenses mentioned above for both years, operating earnings increased 15%, primarily due to higher sales and gross profit margins, and operating expenses increasing at a slightly slower rate than sales. Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2012 increased by 5% to $ 690 million from $ 658 million in 2011 . The increase in net earnings primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $9.52 in 2012 were 5% higher than $9.07 for 2011 , due to increased net earnings. The table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States to adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 2011 % Diluted earnings per share reported $9.52 $9.07 5 % GSA/USPS settlement 0.66 Restructuring 0.18 Goodwill impairment 0.04 Charge for U.S. branch closures 0.03 0.16 Settlement of prior year tax reviews (0.12) Gain on sale of joint venture (0.07) Subtotal 0.91 (0.03) Diluted earnings per share adjusted $10.43 $9.04 15 % Segment Analysis The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $ 6,926 million for 2012 , an increase of $ 425 million , or 7% , when compared with net sales of $ 6,501 million for 2011 . The 7% daily increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 4% Price 3% Total 7% Sales to all customer end-markets increased for 2012 . The increase was led by growth in sales to heavy and light manufacturing customers, followed by diversified commercial services customers. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.3 percentage points in 2012 over 2011 , primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by customer mix. Operating expenses were up 8% for 2012 versus 2011 . The 2012 year included a $76 million expense related to the settlement of disputes involving the GSA and USPS contracts. Also included was $10 million of expense primarily related to branch closure costs and an impairment charge for Grainger Lighting Services (formerly known as Alliance Energy Solutions), an acquisition completed in November 2009. The 2011 year included costs for the closure of 35 branches of $18 million. Excluding these expenses from both years, operating expenses increased 4%, primarily driven by an incremental $70 million in growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. 14 For the segment, operating earnings of $ 1,133 million for 2012 increased 6% over $ 1,066 million in 2011 . Excluding the expenses mentioned above in both years, operating earnings were up 12%. The improvement in operating earnings for 2012 was due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin, and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Canada Net sales were $ 1,106 million for 2012 , an increase of $ 113 million , or 11% , when compared with $ 993 million for 2011 . In local currency, daily sales increased 12% for 2012. The 11% daily increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 11% Price 1% Foreign exchange (1)% Total 11% The increase in net sales was led by growth to oil and gas, commercial and construction customers. The gross profit margin increased 0.2 percentage points in 2012 over 2011 , primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by unfavorable customer and product mix. Operating expenses increased 9% in 2012 . In local currency, operating expenses increased 10% primarily due to higher volume-related payroll and travel costs, and higher advertising and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower occupancy costs. Operating earnings of $ 127 million for 2012 were up $ 20 million , or 18% , versus 2011 . In local currency, operating earnings increased 19% . The increase in earnings was due to strong sales growth, an improved gross profit margin and expense leverage. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include operations in Europe, Asia, Latin America and other U.S. operations were up 55% for 2012 . The sales increase was due primarily to a full year of sales from Fabory, acquired in August 2011, and incremental sales from AnFreixo, acquired in April 2012, as well as strong growth from the businesses in Japan and Mexico. Operating earnings for other businesses were $ 20 million for 2012 compared to $ 31 million for 2011 . The decrease was primarily due to restructuring charges related to improving the long-term performance of the businesses in Europe, India and China. Excluding these charges, operating earnings were up $3 million, primarily driven by improved performance in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by losses from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, along with losses in some start-up businesses in developing markets. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $13 million of expense in 2012 compared with $1 million of expense in 2011. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Interest income (expense) - net $ (13,418 ) $ (7,023 ) Equity in net income of unconsolidated entity 314 Gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated entity 7,639 Other non-operating income 1,866 709 Other non-operating expense (1,784 ) (2,541 ) $ (13,336 ) $ (902 ) 15 Net interest expense increased in 2012 due to higher average debt outstanding, higher average interest rates and interest expense related to capital leases for the acquired business in Europe. In 2011, Grainger divested its 49% ownership in the MRO Korea Co., Ltd. joint venture , resulting in a gain of approximately $8 million. Income Taxes Income taxes of $ 419 million in 2012 increased 9% as compared with $ 385 million in 2011 . Grainger's effective tax rates were 37.5% and 36.6% in 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The 2011 rate benefited from a tax law change in Japan and the settlement of various tax reviews. Excluding these benefits in 2011, the effective tax rate was 38.1%. The effective tax rate in 2012 benefited primarily from a lower blended state tax rate. Grainger is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 37.3% to 37.7% for 2013. 2011 Compared to 2010 Grainger's net sales of $8,078 million for 2011 increased 13% when compared with net sales of $7,182 million for 2010. There was one more selling day in 2011 versus 2010. The 12% daily increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 8% Business acquisitions 2% Price 2% Foreign exchange 1% Oil spill cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico (1)% Total 12% Sales to all customer end-markets except one increased for 2011. The overall increase in net sales was led by a mid-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers, followed by a high single-digit increase in light manufacturing. The agriculture and mining customer end-market declined due to the difficult comparison from the oil spill in 2010. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $3,511 million for 2011 increased 17%. The gross profit margin for 2011 was 43.5%, up 1.7 percentage points versus 2010. The gross profit margin was favorably affected by price increases exceeding product cost increases, a decline in sales of low margin sourced products and lower excess and obsolete inventory requirements. Operating expenses of $2,458 million for 2011 increased 15% from $2,145 million for 2010. Operating expenses increased primarily driven by volume-related costs, expenses from the Fabory acquisition and incremental spending on Grainger's growth programs. The 2011 year also included approximately $18 million of costs related to the closure of branches in the United States. In addition, 2010 benefited by $33 million from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. Operating earnings of $1,052 million for 2011 increased 22% from $860 million for 2010. The increase in operating earnings was due to higher sales and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales. Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2011 increased by 29% to $658 million from $511 million in 2010. The increase in net earnings for 2011 primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $9.07 in 2011 were 31% higher than $6.93 for 2010, due to increased net earnings and fewer shares outstanding. 16 The table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States to adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

The overall increase in net sales was led by a mid-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a high single-digit increase to light manufacturing customers. The agriculture and mining customer end-market declined due to the difficult comparisons from the oil spill in 2010. The segment gross profit margin increased 1.7 percentage points in 2011 over 2010. The gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases, a decline in sales of low margin sourced products and a lower excess and obsolete inventory requirement. Operating expenses were up 10% for 2011 versus 2010. Operating expenses increased driven by volume and growth-related spending including new sales representatives, eCommerce, advertising and incremental expenses for the new distribution center in northern California. The 2011 year also included costs for the closure of 35 branches. In addition, 2010 included a $30 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability. Excluding the branch closure costs from 2011 and the 2010 benefit, operating expenses increased 7%. For the segment, operating earnings of $1,066 million for 2011 increased 16% over $920 million in 2010. The improvement in operating earnings for 2011 was due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales. 17 Canada Net sales were $993 million for 2011, an increase of $172 million, or 21%, when compared with $821 million for 2010. Daily sales were up 20%. In local currency, daily sales increased 15% for 2011. The 20% daily increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 12% Foreign exchange 5% Acquisitions 3% Total 20% The increase in net sales was led by growth to heavy manufacturing, retail, oil and gas, and agriculture and mining customers. The gross profit margin increased 2.3 percentage points in 2011 over 2010, primarily driven by lower product costs and stronger sales of private label products, which carry higher margins. Operating expenses increased 10% in 2011. In local currency, operating expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs driven by higher bonus expense, headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year. Non-payroll related expenses also increased driven by volume-related occupancy and warehouse costs. Operating earnings of $108 million for 2011 were up $61 million, or 130%, versus 2010. In local currency, operating earnings increased 121% due to higher sales, an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include operations in Europe, Asia, Latin America and other U.S. operations, were up 66% for 2011. The increase in net sales was due primarily to Fabory, acquired in August of 2011, along with strong growth from all the other international businesses. Operating earnings for other businesses were $31 million for 2011 compared to $12 million for 2010. The increase was primarily driven by improved performance in Japan and Mexico. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $1 million of expense in 2011 compared with $7 million of expense in 2010. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Interest income (expense) - net $ (7,023 ) $ (6,972 ) Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated entity 314 (182 ) Gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated entity 7,639 Other non-operating income 709 1,608 Other non-operating expense (2,541 ) (1,151 ) $ (902 ) $ (6,697 ) The reduction in net expense was primarily attributable to a gain of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the divestiture of Grainger's 49% ownership in the MRO Korea Co., Ltd. joint venture. Income Taxes Income taxes of $385 million in 2011 increased 13% as compared with $340 million in 2010. Grainger's effective tax rates were 36.6% and 39.8% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2011 rate benefited from a tax law change in Japan and the settlement of various tax reviews. The 2010 effective tax rate included a tax expense related to the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010. Excluding these items in both years, the effective tax rate for 2011 was 38.1% compared to 39.1% in 2010, primarily the result of lower state tax expense and higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in 2011. 18 Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as to pay cash dividends. Cash Flow Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Cash from operating activities continues to serve as Grainger's primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations in 2012 were $816 million and increased $70 million from $746 million in 2011. The primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of $32 million as well as an increase of $38 million in net non-cash expenses. Net cash used in investing activities of $306 million in 2012 was driven by net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $241 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of $65 million. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. Net cash used in investing activities was $229 million less than in 2011 due primarily to a decrease in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $294 million versus 2011. Net cash used in financing activities of $394 million in 2012 increased $217 million from $177 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher treasury shares repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2012 versus 2011. Cash paid for treasury share purchases was $341 million in 2012 versus $151 million in 2011, an increase of $190 million. Cash dividends paid were $220 million in 2012, an increase of $39 million versus 2011. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 Cash from operating activities served as Grainger's primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations in 2011 were $746 million and increased $150 million from $596 million in 2010. The primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of $153 million. Higher accounts receivable and inventory balances, driven by growth in sales volumes and a new distribution center in northern California, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, reduced the operating cash flow from net earnings. Net cash used in investing activities of $535 million in 2011 was driven by net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $190 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of $359 million. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. Net cash used in investing activities was $366 million more than in 2010 due primarily to an increase in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $297 million versus 2010. Net cash used in financing activities of $177 million in 2011 decreased $401 million from $579 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower treasury shares repurchases in 2011 versus 2010. Cash paid for treasury share purchases was $151 million in 2011 versus $505 million in 2010, a reduction of $354 million. Working Capital Internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt. In addition, funds are expended to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital consists of current assets (less non-operating cash) and current liabilities (less short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt). Working capital was $1,604 million at December 31, 2012 , compared with $1,438 million at December 31, 2011 . At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 and 2.4 , respectively. The $166 million increase in working capital and higher current ratio was primarily related to higher accounts receivable and inventory balances, lower accrued compensation and benefits, and lower accounts payable. 19 Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 57,929 $ 51,249 $ 61,001 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 145,483 118,228 50,152 Subtotal 203,412 169,477 111,153 Capitalized software 46,448 27,465 15,971 Total $ 249,860 $ 196,942 $ 127,124 In 2012, significant capital investments were made to build new distribution centers in the United States and for distribution center expansion in Canada. In addition, Grainger continued to invest in the improvement of the eCommerce platform, new and existing international businesses, and for the normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2011, significant expenditures were made to build new distribution centers in the United States and for distribution center expansion in Canada. Also, a large investment was made to update and improve the eCommerce platform in the United States business. Finally, Grainger continued to invest in new and existing international businesses, as well as for normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2010, significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the U.S. and Canada. Additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2013, capital expenditures are expected to range from $280 million to $350 million. Projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain, technology infrastructure and eCommerce. Grainger expects to fund 2013 capital spending from operating cash. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. Refer to Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 15.3% and 15.9% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to increased retained earnings associated with strong earnings in 2012 . Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 20 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2012, Grainger's contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars): Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt obligations $ 564,644 $ 97,596 $ 62,136 $ 389,964 $ 14,948 Interest on debt 39,408 12,679 15,920 7,955 2,854 Operating lease obligations 231,687 54,456 87,554 50,521 39,156 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 85,475 78,560 6,915 Commitments to purchase inventory 352,795 352,795 Other purchase obligations 204,869 145,992 58,194 683 Other liabilities 344,190 176,068 21,465 23,088 123,569 Total $ 1,823,068 $ 918,146 $ 252,184 $ 472,211 $ 180,527 Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and employee benefits plans as determined by actuarial projections, and other employee benefit plans. Other employment-related benefits costs of $45 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Note 7 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately $43 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2012 . This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. 21 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables, the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Based on analysis of actual historical write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable, Grainger's estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts. However, write-offs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends, and Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes. For fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 , actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Inventory Reserves . Grainger establishes inventory reserves for obsolete inventory. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. As Grainger's inventory consists of approximately 1.2 million stocked products, it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a SKU level and no individual SKU is material. There were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of write-offs historically. Grainger's methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date. Actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on Grainger's results of operations based on significant changes in product demand, market conditions or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate. For fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 , actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets . Grainger's business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment write-downs that may occur in future periods. Grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and first performs a qualitative assessment of factors such as a reporting unit's current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Grainger completed the annual impairment testing using the qualitative approach for all of its reporting units and the two-step quantitative test for two of its reporting units. Grainger recorded an impairment of $4 million reducing the carrying value of goodwill to $13 million for one of them. The estimated fair value of the other reporting unit with the carrying value of goodwill of $125 million exceeded its carrying value and no indication of impairment existed as of the test date. 22 Grainger uses the discounted cash flow method to derive the fair value of a reporting unit. The discounted cash flow method requires considerable management judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of its reporting units and general market conditions, including terminal growth rate and discount rate assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these unobservable Level 3 inputs, the results of these tests may differ and impairment charges could occur in future periods. While Grainger will continue to consider the economic environment and other pertinent factors that may have an adverse effect on its reporting units, there can be no assurance that Grainger's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows or other inputs used in forecasting the fair value of future cash flows will prove to be accurate projections. Stock Incentive Plans . Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted used the following assumptions: For the Years Ended December, 2012 2011 2010 Risk-free interest rate 1.1% 2.6% 2.9% Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 25.9% 24.6% 24.7% Expected dividend yield 1.6% 1.8% 2.0% The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders' exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger's stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. Because the expense for other stock-based awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates, and certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger's postretirement benefit obligation and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs. As of December 31, 2012 , Grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 4.5% to 4.0% to reflect the decrease in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that this decrease could reduce 2013 pretax earnings by approximately $5 million. However, other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. 23 Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Total International Composite Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2012, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2012 results (in thousands of dollars): 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 8,909 $ (6,670 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 35,541 (28,647 ) During the fourth quarter 2012, Grainger implemented an Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) and a secondary supplemental "wrap-around" plan for its Medicare eligible retiree medical plan participants, and the Part D Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDS) was eliminated effective January 1, 2013. As a result of the implementation of the EGWP program, the benefit obligation is no longer reduced by Part D RDS as of December 31, 2012. The EGWP program does not alter the benefits expected to be provided to the plan participants and is recognized as an actuarial gain for the year ended December 31, 2012. As a result of this change, Grainger's postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by $19 million as of December 31, 2012. Grainger estimates that this change could increase 2013 pretax earnings by approximately $5 million. During the fourth quarter 2012, Grainger also implemented plan design changes effective January 1, 2013. Employees hired after January 1, 2013 will not be eligible for retiree health benefits. Active participants in the plan as of December 31, 2012 will remain eligible for retiree health benefits with the employee contribution structure modified for certain employees based on retirement eligibility. As a result of this plan amendment, Grainger's postretirement benefit obligation declined $84 million as of December 31, 2012. Grainger estimates that this plan amendment could increase 2013 pretax earnings by approximately $20 million. Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and, therefore, may affect Grainger's retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves . Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. In calculating the liability, historical trends, claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. 24 The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period's results of operations. Grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied. There were no material adjustments based on Grainger's historical experience in 2012, 2011 and 2010 . If actual trends, including the nature, severity or frequency of claims differ from Grainger's estimates, or if business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes . Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management's interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger's best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities, and uncertain tax positions. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Contingent Liabilities. At any time, Grainger may be subject to investigations, legal proceedings, or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business, including claims both by and against Grainger. Such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability, contract disputes, wage and hour laws, employment practices, regulatory compliance or other actions brought by employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers or governmental entities. Grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis, as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees. Grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure, as appropriate, for claims against Grainger when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. Where Grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses, Grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes Grainger's best estimate. Grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against Grainger when losses are reasonably possible and material. These accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws, as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond Grainger's control. Other . Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets, fair value measurements and valuations, and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. Some of Grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. 25 Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumption, assumptions, believe, believes, can, continue, continued, continues, continues to believe it has complied, continuing, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expect, expectation, expected, expects, forecast, forecasts, if, intend, intended, intends, maintains, may, might, no assurance, plans, predict, predictable, presumption, project, projected, projecting, projection, projections, potential, potentially, reasonably likely, scheduled, should, strategy, tend, tended, timing and outcome are uncertain, unanticipated, will, will be realized, and would or similar expressions. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; litigation involving appropriate payment for wages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 26
