ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights 2014 Outlook Results of Operations Restructuring and Other Charges Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc, Daimler Trucks North America, Chrysler Group, LLC (Chrysler), Volvo AB, Komatsu, Navistar International Corporation, Aggreko plc, Ford Motor Company and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG. We serve our customers through a network of over 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and over 6,800 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems, which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and countries in the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. 30 Table of Contents Worldwide revenues in 2013 were down slightly compared to 2012 , as global economic uncertainty continued during the period. International revenues declined by 4 percent with sales down or relatively flat in most international markets primarily due to declines in the off-highway mining market with reduced unit shipments of 37 percent, reduced demand in the international power generation markets and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. These declines were partially offset by an increase in Components segment sales reflecting a full year of sales from Hilite Germany GmbH (Hilite), which was acquired in the third quarter of 2012 and growth in the construction and medium-duty Brazilian truck markets, resulting in higher engine and component demand. Revenue in the U.S. and Canada improved by 3 percent , which reflected the consolidation of three partially-owned North American distributors since June 2012 and improved demand within the Components segment emission solutions business from on-highway OEM and aftermarket products and medium-duty truck customers. Revenues also increased in the Power Generation segment power products business as the result of increased demand in North America. These increases were mostly offset by reduced demand in the on-highway heavy-duty truck and medium-duty bus markets, as well as the off-highway mining and oil and gas markets to which unit shipments declined 15 percent, 25 percent, 30 percent and 37 percent, respectively, compared to last year. Slow growth in the U.S. economy continued to suppress business capital expenditures in 2013, thus impacting demand for truck and power generation equipment. The governments of China and India have tried to control inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit. Brazil began to tighten its monetary policies in the second half of 2013. Tightening monetary policies could create headwinds in our end markets. The European economy remains stagnant and uncertain; however, demand for engines and components in Euro zone countries stabilized somewhat during 2013. Although we do not have any significant direct exposure to European sovereign debt, we generated approximately 8 percent of our net sales from Euro zone countries in both 2013 and 2012 . The following table contains sales and EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) results by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . Refer to the section titled "Operating Segment Results" for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before taxes. Operating Segments 2013 2012 Percent change Percent of Total Percent of Total 2013 vs. 2012 In millions Sales EBIT Sales EBIT Sales EBIT Engine $ 10,013 58 % $ 1,041 $ 10,733 62 % $ 1,248 (7 )% (17 )% Components 4,342 25 % 527 4,012 23 % 426 8 % 24 % Power Generation 3,031 18 % 218 3,268 19 % 285 (7 )% (24 )% Distribution 3,749 22 % 388 3,277 19 % 369 14 % 5 % Intersegment eliminations (3,834 ) (23 )% (3,956 ) (23 )% (3 )% Non-segment (14 ) (25 ) (44 )% Total $ 17,301 100 % $ 2,160 $ 17,334 100 % $ 2,303 (6 )% Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. for 2013 was $1,483 million , or $7.91 per diluted share, on sales of $17.3 billion , compared to 2012 net income attributable to Cummins Inc. of $1,645 million , or $8.67 per diluted share, on sales of $17.3 billion . The decrease in income and earnings per share was driven mainly by lower gross margins, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, higher operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate of 25.1 percent versus 23.5 percent in 2012 . Diluted earnings per share for 2013 benefited $0.06 from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program. In December 2013, we acquired the remaining 35 percent interest in Cummins Western Canada LP (Western Canada) for a total consideration of $34 million. In May 2013, we acquired the remaining 67 percent interest in Cummins Rocky Mountain LLC (Rocky Mountain) for total consideration of approximately $136 million. In January 2013, we acquired an additional 29.99 percent interest in Cummins Northwest LLC (Northwest), followed by the remaining 20.01 percent interest in July 2013, for total consideration of approximately $22 million. We generated $2.1 billion of operating cash flows in 2013 , compared to $1.5 billion in 2012 . Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. 31 Table of Contents In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock. In June 2013, we repurchased the remaining $226 million of common stock to complete this authorization. In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase plan. We purchased $155 million of common stock during 2013 under this new plan. In July 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 25 percent from $0.50 per share to $0.625 per share on a quarterly basis effective in the third quarter. Our debt to capital ratio (capital is defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2013 , was 18.1 percent , compared to 10.0 percent at December 31, 2012 . As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had an ' A ' credit rating with a ' Stable ' outlook from Standard & Poor Rating Services , an ' A ' credit rating and a ' Stable ' outlook from Fitch Ratings and an ' A3 ' credit rating with a ' Stable ' outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. In addition to our $2.8 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have sufficient access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs. On September 16, 2013, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities. In September 2013, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2043. On September 17, 2013, we announced our intention to acquire the equity that we do not already own in most of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors over the next three to five years . Our global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 107 percent funded at year-end 2013. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents approximately 55 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 121 percent funded and our United Kingdom (U.K.) plan was 106 percent funded. Asset returns in 2013 for the U.S. qualified plan was 7.6 percent while the year-end 2013 discount rate was 4.8 percent , up 0.85 percentage points from the 2012 discount rate of 3.95 percent . We expect to contribute $205 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2014. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2014 . We expect pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2014 to decrease by approximately $36 million pre-tax, or $0.12 per diluted share, when compared to 2013 . Refer to application of critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 12 , " PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements , for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 2014 OUTLOOK Near-Term The global economy continued to experience uncertainty throughout 2013 , negatively impacting many international and some North American markets. These impacts were partially offset by improvements in North America primarily due to Distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of three partially-owned North American distributors since June 2012 and improved demand within the Components segment emission solutions business for on-highway OEM and aftermarket products. Economies in emerging markets, including China and India slowed during 2013 which negatively impacted a number of our end markets, especially the off-highway mining market and the power generation markets. We currently expect the following positive trends in 2014 : Market share gains in the North America medium-duty truck market are expected to continue in 2014 and should positively impact sales in both the Engine and Components segments. We plan to continue acquiring our partially-owned North American distributors, which which will increase our Distribution segment revenues. The new Euro VI regulations, effective January 1, 2014, are expected to positively impact sales for aftertreatment products and increase our customer base in Europe. We currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our revenue and earnings potential in 2014 : Power generation markets are expected to remain weak. Demand in most end markets in India is expected to remain weak. Demand in certain European markets could remain weak due to continued economic uncertainty. Growth in emerging markets could be negatively impacted if emission regulations are not strictly enforced. 32 Table of Contents Foreign currency volatility could continue to put pressure on earnings. North American oil and gas markets are expected to remain weak. Domestic and international mining markets could continue to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken. Long-Term We believe that, over the longer term, there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our businesses: tightening emissions controls across the world; infrastructure needs in emerging markets; energy availability and cost issues and globalization of industries like ours. 33 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 In millions (except per share amounts) 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent NET SALES $ 17,301 $ 17,334 $ 18,048 $ (33 ) % $ (714 ) (4 )% Cost of sales 12,918 12,826 13,459 (92 ) (1 )% 633 5 % GROSS MARGIN 4,383 4,508 4,589 (125 ) (3 )% (81 ) (2 )% OPERATING EXPENSES AND INCOME Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,920 1,900 1,837 (20 ) (1 )% (63 ) (3 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 713 728 629 15 2 % (99 ) (16 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 361 384 416 (23 ) (6 )% (32 ) (8 )% Gain on sale of businesses 6 121 (6 ) (100 )% (115 ) (95 )% Other operating income (expense), net (10 ) (16 ) 21 6 (38 )% (37 ) NM OPERATING INCOME 2,101 2,254 2,681 (153 ) (7 )% (427 ) (16 )% Interest income 27 25 34 2 8 % (9 ) (26 )% Interest expense 41 32 44 (9 ) (28 )% 12 27 % Other income (expense), net 32 24 8 33 % 24 100 % INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 2,119 2,271 2,671 (152 ) (7 )% (400 ) (15 )% Income tax expense 531 533 725 2 % 192 26 % CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME 1,588 1,738 1,946 (150 ) (9 )% (208 ) (11 )% Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 105 93 98 (12 ) (13 )% 5 5 % NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CUMMINS INC . $ 1,483 $ 1,645 $ 1,848 $ (162 ) (10 )% $ (203 ) (11 )% Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Cummins Inc. $ 7.91 $ 8.67 $ 9.55 $ (0.76 ) (9 )% $ (0.88 ) (9 )% _____________________________________________________ "NM" - not meaningful information Favorable/(Unfavorable)Percentage Points Percent of sales 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Gross margin 25.3 % 26.0 % 25.4 % (0.7 ) 0.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.1 % 11.0 % 10.2 % (0.1 ) (0.8 ) Research, development and engineering expenses 4.1 % 4.2 % 3.5 % 0.1 (0.7 ) 2013 vs. 2012 Net Sales Net sales decrease d slightly versus 2012 and was primarily driven by the following: Engine segment sales decrease d by 7 percent due to lower demand in the power generation markets, weaker demand in the North American heavy-duty truck markets and continued weakness in industrial demand, primarily in off-high-way mining markets. Power Generation segment sales decrease d by 7 percent due to lower demand in the power solutions business, primarily in the U.K., and lower demand in the power systems and the alternators businesses in international markets, partially offset by improvements in the North American power product business. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by 1 percent. The decrease s were partially offset by the following: Distribution segment sales increase d by 14 percent primarily due to incremental sales in 2013 related to the consolidation of partially-owned North American distributors since June 2012. 34 Table of Contents Components segment sales increase d by 8 percent due to increased sales within the emission solutions business, mainly related to improved on-highway OEM and aftermarket demand in North America, a full year of sales from Hilite which was acquired in the third quarter of 2012, 2013 pre-buy activity in anticipation of the Euro VI emission standards and growth in the medium-duty Brazilian truck market resulting in improved aftertreatment demand. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets (excluding the U.S. and Canada) were 48 percent of total net sales in 2013 , compared with 49 percent of total net sales in 2012 . Gross Margin Gross margin decreased by $125 million and as a percentage of sales decrease d by 0.7 percentage points . The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a decline in demand for high-horsepower engines and gensets, partially offset by improved price realization, lower material and commodity costs and the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of $29 million. The provision for warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percentage of sales was 2.1 percent in both 2013 and 2012 . A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental costs in 2013 related to the acquisition of partially owned North American distributors since June 2012. These costs primarily contributed to increased compensation and related expenses of $52 million and increased variable compensation of $5 million, partially offset by lower consulting of $24 million, the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of $20 million and reduced discretionary spending. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related expenses include salaries and fringe benefits. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.1 percent in 2013 from 11.0 percent in 2012 . Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses decreased primarily due to lower consulting of $30 million and decreased engineering program spending of $23 million, partially offset by increases of $44 million in compensation related expenses. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related expenses include salaries and fringe benefits. Research, development and engineering expenses in 2012 also included restructuring charges of $3 million. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 4.1 percent in 2013 from 4.2 percent in 2012 . Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decrease d primarily due to the following: In millions 2013 vs. 2012 Increase/(Decrease) North American distributors $ (18 ) Cummins Westport, Inc. (10 ) Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Heavy-duty) (8 ) Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Light-duty) 12 Tata Cummins, Ltd. (6 ) Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. 11 All other (3 ) Cummins share of net income (22 ) Royalty and interest income (1 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees $ (23 ) 35 Table of Contents The decrease s above were primarily due to the consolidation of the partially-owned North American distributors acquired in 2013, unfavorable warranty accruals at Cummins Westport, Inc., an impairment charge of an equity investment within the Power Generation segment and additional start-up costs at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Heavy-duty), partially offset by increased demand at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd (Light-duty) and Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. As we execute our plan to acquire partially-owned distributors over the next three to five years, equity earnings for our North American distributors will continue to decrease. See Note 2 , ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Gain on Sale of Businesses In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional $6 million gain ($4 million after-tax) related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011 divestitures. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2012. Other Operating Income (Expense), Net Other operating income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2013 2012 Loss on write off of assets $ (14 ) $ (6 ) Amortization of intangible assets (11 ) (8 ) Royalty expense (4 ) (3 ) Legal matters (2 ) (20 ) Gain (loss) on sale of fixed assets 1 4 Royalty income 20 18 Other, net (1 ) Total other operating income (expense), net $ (10 ) $ (16 ) Interest Income Interest income was relatively flat compared to 2012 . Interest Expense Interest expense increased primarily due to the $1 billion debt issuance in September 2013. Interest expense will increase in future periods as a result of this issuance. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2013 2012 Gain (loss) on marketable securities, net $ 13 $ 3 Gain on fair value adjustment for consolidated investee (1) 12 7 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance 12 5 Dividend income 5 7 Gain on sale of equity investment 13 Bank charges (10 ) (15 ) Foreign currency gains (losses), net (27 ) (14 ) Other, net 27 18 Total other income (expense), net $ 32 $ 24 ____________________________________________________________ (1) See Note 2 , ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 36 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was 25.1 percent compared to 23.5 percent for 2012 . As a result of a restructuring of our foreign operations in 2013, our 2013 effective tax rate was approximately 1% less than it would have been without restructuring. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated the research tax credit back to 2012. As tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment, we recognized a $28 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013. We also recognized a discrete tax expense of $17 million in the first quarter which primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax asset deemed unrecoverable. Also included in 2013 is a third quarter discrete net tax expense of $7 million primarily related to U.S. federal tax return true-up adjustments and third quarter enactment of U.K tax law changes. Additionally, our effective tax rate for 2013 also included a fourth quarter discrete net tax benefit of $21 million primarily due to the release of U.S. deferred tax liabilities related to prior years unremitted income of certain Indian and Mexican subsidiaries now considered to be permanently reinvested, as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts principally based on our 2012 state tax return filings. Our 2012 income tax provision included a one-time $134 million tax benefit which resulted from tax planning strateges and tax return elections made with respect to our U.K. operations. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2013, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $177 million . These assets included $187 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $101 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. We expect our 2014 effective tax rate to be 28.5 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. The research tax credit expired December 31, 2013, and has not yet been renewed by Congress. If the research credit is reinstated during 2014, we would anticipate the 2014 effective tax rate to be reduced to 27 percent. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is attributable primarily to one-time tax benefits in 2013 that will not repeat in 2014, as well as other changes in tax legislation in the U.S. and proposed changes in the U.K. that will unfavorably impact our 2014 effective tax rate. In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service released final tangible personal property regulations regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property. The new rules will become effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. While we are still finalizing our analysis, we do not believe that these regulations will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increase d reflecting our minority's share of higher profits of $7 million at Cummins Western Canada LP, $6 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd. and $4 million due to the acquisition of a majority interest in Cummins Central Power LLC (Central Power) in the third quarter of 2012. The increase s were partially offset by a total decrease of $8 million at Cummins India Ltd. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decrease d primarily due to lower gross margin as a percentage of sales, mainly driven by unfavorable product mix and lower volumes, particularly in the Engine segment and Power Generation segment, a higher effective tax rate of 25.1 percent versus 23.5 percent in 2012 , lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, mainly due to the acquisition of the North American distributors, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. These decrease s were partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 benefited $0.06 from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program. 37 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Net Sales Net sales decreased versus 2011 and was primarily driven by the following: Engine segment sales decreased by 5 percent due to weakness in industrial demand, especially in international construction markets, and lower volumes in the Brazilian medium-duty truck market, which were partially offset by growth in the North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year, led by the heavy-duty business. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by 2 percent. Power Generation segment sales decreased by 7 percent due to lower demand in the alternators, power solutions and power systems businesses, which were partially offset by growing demand in the power product business, especially in North America. Components segment sales, excluding acquisitions, decreased by 2 percent due to $126 million of sales in 2011 related to assets sold in 2011 and lower demand in the turbo technologies, filtration and fuel systems businesses, which were partially offset by higher demand in the emission solutions business, primarily in North America and Brazil. The decreases above were partially offset as Distribution segment sales, excluding acquisitions, increased by 2 percent due to higher demand for parts and filtration products especially in North and Central America, increased power generation growth in East Asia, increased demand in the South Pacific and higher service demand from South Pacific mining customers, which were partially offset by lower engine product sales due to a slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets (excluding the U.S. and Canada) were 49 percent of total net sales in 2012, compared with 56 percent of total net sales in 2011. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased by $81 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 0.6 percentage points. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower material costs, improved price realization, lower warranty costs and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and restructuring charges of $29 million. The provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales was 2.1 percent in both 2012 and 2011. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher consulting of $45 million, restructuring and other charges of $20 million and an increase of $19 million in compensation and related expenses, which were partially offset by reduced discretionary spending in the second half of the year. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $87 million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance. In the third quarter of 2012, we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with the slowdown in demand at several of our key markets in the second half of the year. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.0 percent in 2012 from 10.2 percent in 2011. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $54 million in compensation and related expenses and increased consulting of $32 million. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $25 million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance. Research, development and engineering expenses in 2012 also included restructuring and other charges of $3 million. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 4.2 percent in 2012 from 3.5 percent in 2011. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. 38 Table of Contents Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following: In millions 2012 vs. 2011 Increase/(Decrease) Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. $ (28 ) Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (7 ) Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Light-duty) 12 North American distributors 13 All other (18 ) Cummins share of net income (28 ) Royalty and interest income (4 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees $ (32 ) The decreases above were primarily due to lower sales in China at Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd., which were partially offset by growth in North American distributors and higher sales at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (Light-duty). Gain on Sale of Businesses In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was $123 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $62 million in 2011 (through closing). Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $9 million in 2011 (through closing). During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $64 million in 2011 (through closing). Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $13 million in 2011 (through closing). In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional $6 million gain ($4 million after-tax) related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011 divestitures. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2012. Other Operating Income (Expense), Net Other operating income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2012 2011 Royalty income $ 18 $ 12 Flood damage gain 38 Loss on sale of fixed assets (2 ) (10 ) Royalty expense (3 ) (3 ) Amortization of intangible assets (8 ) (5 ) Legal matters (20 ) (5 ) Other, net (1 ) (6 ) Total other operating income (expense), net $ (16 ) $ 21 39 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average investment balances in 2012 compared to 2011.

Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 23.5 percent compared to 27.1 percent for 2011. Our 2012 income tax provision included a one-time $134 million tax benefit which resulted from tax planning strategies and tax return elections made with respect to our U.K. operations. Our 2011 income tax provision included a tax benefit of $48 million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related tax reserves. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also included a tax benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a tax benefit of $16 million which resulted from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with taxing authorities. The 2011 income tax provision also included to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily related to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and changes in the U.K. as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $5 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd., $3 million at Cummins Western Canada LP. and $3 million at Power Systems India. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6 million at Cummins Power Solutions Ltd. and $2 million at Cummins Central Power LLC. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decreased primarily due to lower volumes, particularly in the international construction and medium-duty truck markets, higher research, development and engineering expenses, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees. These decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate of 23.5 percent versus 27.1 percent in 2011. In addition, the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain asset and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana did not repeat in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 also benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. 40 Table of Contents RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2012. These actions were in response to reduced demand in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2012, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2013. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 3 percent . We also reduced our hourly workforce by approximately 650 employees. During 2012, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly workforce reductions of approximately $49 million . Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. We incurred a $1 million charge for lease terminations and a $2 million charge for asset impairments and other non-cash charges. During 2012, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $52 million ( $35 million after-tax). These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December 31, 2012 Workforce reductions $ 49 Exit activities 1 Other 2 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 Restructuring and other charges were included in each segment in our operating results as follows: In millions Year ended December 31, 2012 Engine $ 20 Distribution 14 Power Generation 12 Components 6 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 The table below summarizes where the restructuring and other charges are located in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012. In millions Year ended December 31, 2012 Cost of sales $ 29 Selling, general and administrative expenses 20 Research, development and engineering expenses 3 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 At December 31, 2013 , of the approximately 1,300 employees affected by this plan, substantially all terminations have been completed. 41 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the activity and balance of accrued restructuring charges, which is included in "Other accrued expenses" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. In millions 2012 Restructuring charges (1) $ 50 Cash payments for 2012 actions (25 ) Balance at December 31, 2012 25 Cash payments for 2012 actions (22 ) Change in estimate (2) (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2013 $ __________________________________________________ (1) Restructuring charges include severance pay, benefits and related charges, as well as lease termination costs. (2) Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in calculating the initial estimates, the actual amounts paid for such activities differed slightly from the amounts initially recorded. We have adjusted the previous estimates accordingly. OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, flood damage gains or losses, divestiture gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. Following is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments. 42 Table of Contents Engine Segment Results Financial data for the Engine segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 In millions 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 8,270 $ 9,101 $ 9,649 $ (831 ) (9 )% $ (548 ) (6 )% Intersegment sales 1,743 1,632 1,658 111 7 % (26 ) (2 )% Total sales 10,013 10,733 11,307 (720 ) (7 )% (574 ) (5 )% Depreciation and amortization 205 192 181 (13 ) (7 )% (11 ) (6 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 416 433 397 17 4 % (36 ) (9 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 136 127 166 9 7 % (39 ) (23 )% Interest income 16 11 18 5 45 % (7 ) (39 )% Segment EBIT 1,041 1,248 1,384 (207 ) (17 )% (136 ) (10 )% Percentage Points Percentage Points Segment EBIT as a percentage of total sales 10.4 % 11.6 % 12.2 % (1.2 ) (0.6 ) Engine segment sales by market were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 In millions 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent Heavy-duty truck $ 2,705 $ 2,964 $ 2,791 $ (259 ) (9 )% $ 173 6 % Medium-duty truck and bus 2,185 2,091 2,320 94 4 % (229 ) (10 )% Light-duty automotive and RV 1,300 1,279 1,176 21 2 % 103 9 % Total on-highway 6,190 6,334 6,287 (144 ) (2 )% 47 1 % Industrial 2,996 3,233 3,850 (237 ) (7 )% (617 ) (16 )% Stationary power 827 1,166 1,170 (339 ) (29 )% (4 ) Total sales $ 10,013 $ 10,733 $ 11,307 $ (720 ) (7 )% $ (574 ) (5 )% Unit shipments by engine classification (including unit shipments to Power Generation) were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent Midrange 446,000 440,500 509,400 5,500 1 % (68,900 ) (14 )% Heavy-duty 105,400 119,100 116,300 (13,700 ) (12 )% 2,800 2 % High-horsepower 14,800 19,800 21,600 (5,000 ) (25 )% (1,800 ) (8 )% Total unit shipments 566,200 579,400 647,300 (13,200 ) (2 )% (67,900 ) (10 )% 2013 vs. 2012 Sales Engine segment sales decrease d versus 2012 due to lower demand in stationary power, heavy-duty truck and industrial businesses, partially offset by the medium-duty truck business. The following are the primary drivers by market: Stationary power engine sales decrease d due to lower demand in power generation markets. Heavy-duty truck engine sales decrease d due to weaker demand in North American on-highway markets during the first half of the year compared to the recovery experienced in the first half of 2012 as trucking companies replaced aging fleets. 43 Table of Contents Industrial market sales decrease d primarily due to a 36 percent reduction in global mining shipments as a result of lower commodity prices and a 37 percent decline in engine shipments to North American oil and gas markets, partially offset by increased shipments to the Western European construction markets as a result of the pre-buy activity in 2013 ahead of the Tier IV emission regulations beginning in the first quarter of 2014. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales. The decrease s above were partially offset by the following: Medium-duty truck engine sales increase d due to market share gains in the North American medium-duty truck market and improved demand in the Brazilian and European truck markets. The improved sales in Brazil were primarily due to lower sales in the first half of 2012 as the result of the implementation of the Euro V emission regulations beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Total on-highway-related sales for 2013 were 62 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 59 percent in 2012 . Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decrease d versus 2012 , primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by lower research, development and engineering expenses and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. Engine segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (237 ) (10 )% (0.7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1 % (0.5 ) Research, development and engineering expenses 17 4 % (0.2 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 9 7 % 0.2 The decrease in gross margin versus 2012 was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and lower high-horsepower volumes, partially offset by improved price realization, decreased material and commodity costs and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending and the absence of restructuring charges incurred in 2012, partially offset by increased headcount. The decrease in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending in 2013, partially offset by increases in new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to increased earnings at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. within the light-duty business and Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd, partially offset by decreased earnings at Cummins Westport, Inc. and larger losses at Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (Heavy-duty) in anticipation of production in the second quarter of 2014. 2012 vs. 2011 Sales Engine segment sales decreased versus 2011 due to lower demand in the industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses, partially offset by growth in the heavy-duty truck and light-duty automotive and RV businesses. The following are the primary drivers by market: Industrial market sales decreased primarily due to a 53 percent decline in construction engine shipments in international markets, including a 72 percent decline in China, and a 44 percent decline in engine shipments to the North American oil and gas markets due to weakened natural gas prices, which were partially offset by a 4 percent increase in engine shipments in the North American construction market. 44 Table of Contents Medium-duty truck and bus sales decreased primarily due to lower demand in the Brazilian truck market due to pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the implementation of Euro V emission regulations in the first quarter of 2012 and one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with a proprietary engine in 2012. The B6.7 engine replacement was partially offset by the 2012 launch of our ISF and 9 liter engines in new light-duty on-highway and medium-duty truck applications, respectively, with this same customer. The decrease was further offset by improved demand in North American markets. The decreases above were partially offset by the following: Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to growth in the North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year, primarily as a result of the replacement of aging fleets. Light-duty automotive and RV sales increased primarily due to a 37 percent improvement in units shipped to Chrysler. Total on-highway-related sales for 2012 were 59 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 56 percent in 2011. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower gross margin, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, higher research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Engine segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $20 million in the fourth quarter. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (82 ) (3 )% 0.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses (8 ) (1 )% (0.4 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (36 ) (9 )% (0.5 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (39 ) (23 )% (0.3 ) The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to lower volumes and restructuring and other charges, which was partially offset by improved price realization, lower material costs, favorable product mix and improved product coverage. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to weaker demand for on-highway products at DCEC.

The increase s above were partially offset by the following: Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results. Fuel systems business sales decrease d primarily due to lower demand in North American on-highway markets and lower demand in Europe, partially offset by increased aftermarket demand. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increase d versus 2012 , primarily due to higher gross margin. Components segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $6 million in the fourth quarter. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 112 13 % 0.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 7 3 % 0.7 Research, development and engineering expenses (5 ) (2 )% 0.3 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (1 ) (3 )% (0.1 ) The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes in the emission solutions business and lower material and commodity costs in several businesses, partially offset by increased product coverage costs and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending in 2013, partially offset by increased compensation and variable compensation expense. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and new product development spending, partially offset by lower consulting expenses. 46 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Acquisition In April 2012, we reached an agreement to acquire the doser technology and business assets from Hilite in a cash transaction. Dosers are products that enable compliance with emission standards in certain aftertreatment systems and complement our current product offerings. The transaction was approved by German regulators in June and closed on July 18, 2012. The purchase price was $176 million. There was no contingent consideration associated with this transaction. During 2012, we expensed approximately $4 million of acquisition related costs. See Note 2 , " ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Excluding Acquisition Selected financial information for our Components segment excluding the impact of the acquisition on 2012 sales and EBIT was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 In millions 2012 2011 Amount Percent Excluding acquisition Total sales $ 3,966 $ 4,063 $ (97 ) (2 )% Segment EBIT 434 470 (36 ) (8 )% Percentage Points Segment EBIT as a percentage of total sales 10.9 % 11.6 % (0.7 ) Sales Components segment sales, excluding the acquisition, decreased versus 2011. The following are the primary drivers: Turbo technologies business sales decreased primarily due to a decline in OEM sales in Europe and China, reduced aftermarket demand and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by higher OEM demand in North America in the first half of the year. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results. Filtration business sales decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business and our exhaust business in 2011 and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related sales were $71 million in 2011. The decreases were partially offset by increased aftermarket demand in the first half of the year. Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to lower European demand and reduced aftermarket demand, which were partially offset by improved demand in North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year. The decreases above were partially offset by the emission solutions business as sales increased primarily due to higher demand in the North American on-highway market in the first half of the year and new sales in the Brazilian on-highway market as the result of new emission requirements effective January 1, 2012, partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business in the second quarter of 2011, lower price realization and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related sales were $55 million in 2011. 47 Table of Contents Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher research, development and engineering expenses. Components segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $6 million in the fourth quarter.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. In 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and recognized $68 million and $53 million, respectively, in pre-tax gain on the sales. The gains have been excluded from Components results as they were not considered in our evaluation of Components operating results for the year ended 2011.

Sales for our Power Generation segment by business (including 2011 reorganized balances) were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 In millions 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent Power products $ 1,725 $ 1,654 $ 1,636 $ 71 4 % $ 18 1 % Power systems 656 757 815 (101 ) (13 )% (58 ) (7 )% Alternators 496 566 673 (70 ) (12 )% (107 ) (16 )% Power solutions 154 291 374 (137 ) (47 )% (83 ) (22 )% Total sales $ 3,031 $ 3,268 $ 3,498 $ (237 ) (7 )% $ (230 ) (7 )% 2013 vs. 2012 Sales Power Generation segment sales decrease d versus 2012 , primarily due to lower demand in the power solutions and power systems businesses. The following are the primary drivers by business: Power solutions sales decrease d primarily due to lower volumes in the U.K., partially offset by increased sales in Asia. Power systems sales decrease d primarily due to reduced demand in India, the Middle East, China, Asia and Russia, partially offset by increased sales in Western Europe. Alternators sales decrease d primarily due to demand reductions in Europe, the U.K. and India. The decrease s above were partially offset by power products as sales increase d primarily due to higher volumes in North America and improved price realization. These increase s were partially offset by demand reductions in India and Asia and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT decrease d versus 2012 , primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Power Generation segment EBIT for 2013 included an $8 million legal settlement in the third quarter and an $8 million impairment charge for the write-off of an equity method investment in the fourth quarter, while segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $12 million in the fourth quarter. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: 49 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (70 ) (11 )% (0.9 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 14 4 % (0.3 ) Research, development and engineering expenses 3 4 % (0.1 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (8 ) (20 )% (0.1 ) The decrease in gross margin versus 2012 was due to lower volumes, partially offset by improved price realization and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The decrease s in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to the absence of restructuring charges incurred in the fourth quarter of last year and lower discretionary spending to align with slowing demand in key markets. The decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was due to an $8 million impairment charge of an equity method investment in the fourth quarter of 2013. 2012 vs. 2011 Sales Power Generation segment sales decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower demand in the alternators, power solutions and power systems businesses. The following are the primary drivers by business: Alternators sales decreased primarily due to demand reductions in Europe and Asia and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Power solutions sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes in Europe, Africa, Russia and Asia. Power systems sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes in the Middle East, North America and Latin America and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by stronger demand in Asia and improved price realization. The decreases above were partially offset by power products as sales increased primarily due to higher volumes in North America and Western Europe and improved price realization. These increases were partially offset by demand reductions in China, the U.K., Latin America and Eastern Europe and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower gross margin, higher research, development and engineering expenses, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Power Generation segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $12 million in the fourth quarter. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (60 ) (9 )% (0.4 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (6 ) (2 )% (0.8 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (22 ) (41 )% (0.8 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (7 ) (15 )% (0.1 ) The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was due to lower volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, higher material costs, increased product coverage and restructuring and other charges, which were partially offset by improved price realization. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012 to align with slowing demand in key markets. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and new product development spending. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to lower profitability at Cummins Olayan Energy Ltd. and Chongqing Cumins Engine Company, Ltd. 50 Table of Contents Distribution Segment Results Financial data for the Distribution segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 In millions 2013 2012 2011 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 3,726 $ 3,261 $ 3,021 $ 465 14 % $ 240 8 % Intersegment sales 23 16 23 7 44 % (7 ) (30 )% Total sales 3,749 3,277 3,044 472 14 % 233 8 % Depreciation and amortization 54 34 25 (20 ) (59 )% (9 ) (36 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 6 6 3 % (3 ) (100 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 165 188 172 (23 ) (12 )% 16 9 % Interest income 2 2 3 % (1 ) (33 )% Segment EBIT (1) 388 369 386 19 5 % (17 ) (4 )% Percentage Points Percentage Points Segment EBIT as a percentage of total sales 10.3 % 11.3 % 12.7 % (1.0 ) (1.4 ) _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Segment EBIT for 2013 included gains of $5 million and $7 million related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing 33 percent and 50 percent ownership in Rocky Mountain and Northwest, respectively, to fair value in accordance with GAAP.

On December 31, 2013, we also acquired the remaining interest in already consolidated Western Canada. In 2012, we purchased the majority interest in Central Power, an equity investee, as well as several immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 , " ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 51 Table of Contents 2013 vs. 2012 Sales Distribution segment sales increase d versus 2012 primarily due to $507 million of incremental sales in 2013 related to the acquisition of partially-owned North American distributors since June 2012. The acquisition-related sales by product were as follows: $236 million for the parts and filtration business, $94 million for the engine business, $117 million for the power generation business, and $60 million for the service business. These increases were partially offset by decreased engine product sales, primarily due to a significant slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets, and by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding acquisition related sales, all other changes by product line were relatively flat versus 2012 . Segment EBIT Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2013 vs. 2012 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 86 13 % (0.4 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (41 ) (8 )% 0.9 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (23 ) (12 )% (1.3 ) Distribution segment EBIT increase d versus 2012 , primarily due to higher gross margin as a result of the acquisition and consolidation of partially owned North American distributors in 2013. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees as a result of the acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets related to these acquisitions also negatively impacted EBIT for 2013. These acquisitions resulted in a $12 million gain related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing ownership interest in 2013, compared to a $7 million gain related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing 35 percent ownership in Central Power in 2012. Distribution segment EBIT also included restructuring and other charges of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. 2012 vs. 2011 Sales The 2012 Central Power acquisition related sales by product were $61 million for the parts and filtration business, $52 million for the engine business, $28 million for the power generation business, and $18 million for the service business. Distribution segment sales, excluding acquisition related sales of $159 million, increased versus 2011 due to higher demand in the parts and filtration, power generation and service businesses, partially offset by lower demand in the engine business. The following were the primary drivers by line of business: Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America and the Middle East. Power generation product sales increased primarily due to growth in East Asia and improved demand in the South Pacific, which were partially offset by a reduction in nonrecurring project-related sales in the Middle East. Service revenue increased primarily due to higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific and higher volumes in East Asia and Europe. The increases above were partially offset by the following: Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results. 52 Table of Contents Engine product sales decreased primarily due to a significant slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets and lower demand in Europe as a result of pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the 2012 emissions change for certain construction engines, which were partially offset by growth in East Asia. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses, which were partially offset by higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees and higher gross margin. Distribution segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $14 million in the fourth quarter. Major components of EBIT and related changes to segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Including acquisitions Gross margin $ 11 2 % (1.2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (46 ) (10 )% (0.3 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (3 ) (100 )% (0.1 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 16 9 % Excluding acquisitions Gross margin (18 ) (3 )% (1.1 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (23 ) (5 )% (0.4 ) Segment EBIT Excluding Acquisitions The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, unfavorable variations in geographic mix and restructuring and other charges, which were partially offset by higher volumes in most products. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was mainly due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to increased income from North American distributors.

The year ended December 31, 2011, included a $68 million gain ($37 million after-tax) and a $53 million gain ($33 million after-tax) related to the Component segment sales of certain assets and liabilities from our exhaust and light-duty filtration businesses, respectively, and a $38 million gain ($24 million after-tax) related to the insurance settlement regarding the June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. The gains and losses have been excluded from segment results as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. (2) Depreciation and amortization as shown on a segment basis excludes the amortization of debt discount and deferred costs that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as "Interest expense." 53 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. As a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2013. Under this shelf registration we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred and preference stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. In September 2013, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2043. We received net proceeds of $979 million . The senior notes pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1, commencing on April 1, 2014. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or sell, assign, convey, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets to another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to create or assume liens and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We currently anticipate using a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for the planned acquisitions of the equity that we do not already own in our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors, as well as for general corporate purposes. We plan to spend approximately $400 million to $500 million on distributor acquisitions and refinancings in 2014. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We generate significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends on our common stock, fund repurchases of common stock and make acquisitions. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2013 , other sources of liquidity included: cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion , of which approximately 53 percent was located in the U.S. and 47 percent was located outside the U.S., primarily in the U.K., China and Singapore, marketable securities of $150 million , which were located in India and the U.S. and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days, revolving credit facility with $1.7 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit and international and other domestic short-term credit facilities with $310 million available. We believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock repurchases, acquisitions and debt service obligations. We continue to generate cash from operations in the U.S. and maintain access to $1.7 billion of our revolver as noted above. Our revolving credit agreement provides us with a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes. See Note 10 , " DEBT " to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The credit agreement includes one financial covenant: a leverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.25 to 1.0. At December 31, 2013 , our leverage ratio was 0.70 to 1.0. A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2013 , the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.4 billion , the vast majority of which was located in the U.K., China, Singapore and India. The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources. If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes. For example, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the U.S. consist primarily of earnings of our China and U.K. domiciled subsidiaries. At present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted 54 Table of Contents permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. Earnings generated after 2011 from our China operations are considered permanently reinvested, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years . The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $8 million to $82 million over each of the next five years. Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

Current liabilities increase d 7 percent compared to 2012 , primarily due to an increase in accounts payable trade and an increase in other accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in taxes payable. Inventory turnover decrease d 0.3 turns compared to 2012 . The decrease was primarily due to inventory acquired as part of the acquisitions of Rocky Mountain and Northwest in 2013. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increase d $1,330 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to a decrease of $115 million during the comparable period in 2012 .

During 2013 , the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $65 million compared to a cash outflow of $775 million in 2012 . This change of $710 million was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable due to timing differences, lower net tax payments of $311 million due to the receipt of income tax refunds in 2013, which were partially offset by tax payments, and a smaller decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable in 2013 as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus 2012. Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. In 2013 , the investment return on our U.S. pension trust was 7.6 percent while our U.K. pension trust return was 10.9 percent. Approximately 77 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities. The remaining 23 percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity and insurance contracts. We made $169 million of pension contributions in 2013 , including $112 million of voluntary contributions. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits approximated $48 million , net of reimbursements, in 2013 . These contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. We anticipate making total contributions of $205 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2014 . Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2014 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements. 56 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2011 primarily due to unfavorable working capital fluctuations and lower consolidated net income, which were partially offset by a lower non-cash gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business in 2012. During 2012, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $775 million compared to a cash outflow of $154 million in 2011. This change of $621 million was primarily driven by lower accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts payable, as volumes dropped in the second half of the year, and higher cash tax payments of approximately $159 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable and a smaller increase in inventory in 2012.

On September 17, 2013, we announced our intention to acquire the equity that we do not already own in most of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors over the next three to five years . We plan to spend approximately $400 million to $500 million on distributor acquisitions and refinancing in 2014. Capital expenditures were $676 million in 2013 compared to $690 million in 2012 . Despite the challenging economies around the world, we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. We plan to spend between $700 million and $800 million in 2014 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards. Over 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the U.S. in 2014. As of December 31, 2013 , we have committed to invest an additional $52 million in existing joint ventures, of which the entire amount is expected to be funded in 2014. 2012 vs. 2011 Net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2011 primarily due to cash investments for the acquisitions of Hilite and Central Power, proceeds from the 2011 disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business, which did not repeat in 2012, and increased capital expenditures. 57 Table of Contents Financing Activities Years ended December 31, Change In millions 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 Proceeds from borrowings $ 1,004 $ 64 $ 127 $ 940 $ (63 ) Payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations (90 ) (145 ) (237 ) 55 92 Net borrowings under short-term credit agreements (3 ) 11 6 (14 ) 5 Distributions to noncontrolling interests (75 ) (62 ) (56 ) (13 ) (6 ) Dividend payments on common stock (420 ) (340 ) (255 ) (80 ) (85 ) Repurchases of common stock (381 ) (256 ) (629 ) (125 ) 373 Excess tax benefits on stock-based awards 13 14 5 (1 ) 9 Other, net 4 20 14 (16 ) 6 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 52 $ (694 ) $ (1,025 ) $ 746 $ 331 2013 vs. 2012 In September 2013, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2043. Net proceeds from the issuance were $979 million. Net cash provided by financing activities increase d versus 2012 primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and lower payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations, partially offset by higher repurchases of common stock and higher dividend payments. Our total debt was $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 , compared with $775 million as of December 31, 2012 . Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 18.1 percent at December 31, 2013 , compared with 10.0 percent at December 31, 2012 . 2012 vs. 2011 Net cash used in financing activities decreased versus 2011 primarily due to significantly lower repurchases of common stock and decreased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations, which were partially offset by higher dividend payments and decreased proceeds from borrowings. Our total debt was $775 million as of December 31, 2012, compared with $783 million as of December 31, 2011. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 10.0 percent at December 31, 2012, compared with 11.8 percent at December 31, 2011. Repurchase of Common Stock In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock, which was completed in February 2011. Repurchases under this plan by year were as follows: In millions (except per share amounts) Shares Purchased Average Cost Per Share Total Cost of Repurchases Remaining Authorized Capacity 2008 2.3 $ 55.49 $ 128 $ 372 2009 0.4 46.52 20 352 2010 3.5 68.57 241 111 2011 1.1 104.47 111 Total 7.3 $ 500 In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the $500 million program. Under this authorization, we repurchased $518 million of shares in 2011 and $256 million of shares in 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase plan. In 2013, we made the following quarterly purchases under the repurchase programs indicated: 58 Table of Contents In millions (except per share amounts) For each quarter ended Shares Purchased Average Cost Per Share Total Cost of Repurchases Remaining Authorized Capacity February 2011, $1 billion repurchase program March 31 $ $ $ 226 June 30 2.0 113.44 226 Subtotal 2.0 $ 113.44 $ 226 $ December 2012, $1 billion repurchase program June 30 0.6 $ 107.74 $ 63 $ 937 September 29 937 December 31 0.7 129.18 92 845 Subtotal 1.3 119.54 $ 155 $ 845 Total 3.3 $ 115.85 $ 381 $ 845 Quarterly Dividends In July 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.50 per share to $0.625 per share. In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.40 per share to $0.50 per share. In July 2011, the Board of Directors approved a 52 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.2625 per share to $0.40 per share. Cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2013 2012 2011 First quarter $ 0.50 $ 0.40 $ 0.2625 Second quarter 0.50 0.40 0.2625 Third quarter 0.625 0.50 0.40 Fourth quarter 0.625 0.50 0.40 Total $ 2.25 $ 1.80 $ 1.325 Total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were $420 million , $340 million and $255 million respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations. Credit Ratings A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2013 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications. In October 2012, Fitch Ratings upgraded our ratings to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable. In April 2013, Moody Investors Service, Inc. raised our rating to A3 and changed our outlook to stable. Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. confirmed our credit ratings as 'A', 'A' and 'A3', respectively, subsequent to the third quarter issuance of $1 billion in senior notes. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below.

The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $169 million as of December 31, 2013 . We are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits. 60 Table of Contents Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 11 , " PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2013 and 2012 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2013 , we recorded net deferred tax assets of $177 million . These assets included $187 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $101 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4 , " INCOME TAXES ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2013, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 30 percent of the time while returns of 8.0 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2013 one-year return of 7.6 percent , combined with the very favorable returns in 2012, has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets 61 Table of Contents experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 7.5 percent per year in 2014 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of December 31, 2013, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 5.6 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 6.5 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The one-year return for our U.K. plan was 10.9 percent for 2013 , and similar to our U.S. plan, the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 5.8 percent in 2014 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocations at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and target allocation for 2014 are as follows: U.S. Plans U.K. Plans Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Investment description 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012 Fixed income 64.0 % 57.0 % 47.5 % 45.0 % 43.7 % 46.0 % Equity securities 22.0 % 35.5 % 40.1 % 30.5 % 43.2 % 43.0 % Real estate/other 14.0 % 7.5 % 12.4 % 24.5 % 13.1 % 11.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2011 - 2013 and our expected rate of return for 2014 . Long-term Expected Return Assumptions 2014 2013 2012 2011 U.S. plans 7.50 % 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % U.K. plans 5.80 % 5.80 % 6.50 % 7.00 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability. GAAP for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $838 million ($579 million after-tax) from cumulative actuarial net losses for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2013 , we had net pension actuarial losses of $478 million and $361 million for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Net actuarial gains increased our shareholders' equity by $102 million (after-tax) in 2013 . The gains were due to a liability gain from a higher U.S. discount rate and improved plan asset performance for the U.K. plan, partially offset by U.K. liability losses from a higher inflation assumption and a lower discount rate. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. 62 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the period 2011 - 2013 and our expected cost for 2014 . In millions 2014 2013 2012 2011 Net periodic pension cost $ 57 $ 87 $ 64 $ 68 We expect 2014 net periodic pension cost to decrease significantly over 2013 , due to reduced loss amortizations resulting from improved U.S. asset performance and a higher discount rate. The increase in periodic pension cost in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount, decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our U.K. plan as we de-risk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments. The decrease in periodic pension cost in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to improved returns on assets and strong contributions in 2011. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost the discount rate. The weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2014 2013 2012 2011 U.S. plans 4.83 % 3.97 % 4.82 % 5.42 % U.K. plans 4.60 % 4.70 % 5.20 % 5.80 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Service Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch Ratings and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of December 31, 2013 , by at least two of the bond rating agencies. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits. Our model called for projected payments until current participants have received payment of benefits over a period of approximately 80 years in the U.S. and U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2014 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In millions Impact on Pension Cost Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities 0.25 percent increase $ (11 ) 0.25 percent decrease 10 Expected rate of return on assets 1 percent increase (38 ) 1 percent decrease 38 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Note 12 , " PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . 63 Table of Contents RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Specifically, the amendment requires disclosure of the line items on net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. It also requires cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period. The new rules became effective for us beginning January 1, 2013 and were adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The standard resulted in new disclosures in NOTE 16, "OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)." In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. This information enables users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position. The new rules became effective on January 1, 2013. In January 2013, the FASB further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowings and lending transactions. This standard resulted in new disclosures in NOTE 21, "DERIVATIVES."
