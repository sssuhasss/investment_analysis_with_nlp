Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Recent Events 2007 Market Dislocation During the second half of 2007, extreme dislocations emerged in the financial markets, including the leveraged finance, subprime mortgage, and commercial paper markets. These dislocations were further compounded by the decoupling of typical correlations in the various markets in which we do business. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the credit ratings of certain structured securities (e.g., CDOs) were downgraded which among other things triggered further widening of credit spreads for these types of securities. We have been an active participant in the CDO market and maintain ongoing exposure to these securities and have incurred losses associated with these exposures. For more information regarding Capital Markets and Advisory Services (CMAS) results including CDOs, leveraged finance and related ongoing exposure, see the CMAS discussion beginning on page 27. In addition, the market dislocation impacted the credit ratings of structured investment vehicles (SIVs) in the market place. GWIM manages certain cash funds which have invested in SIV transactions. We have entered into capital commitments to support these funds and have incurred losses associated with these commitments including losses on certain securities purchased earlier from these funds at fair value. For more information on our cash fund support, see the GWIM discussion beginning on page 31. In 2008, we continue to have exposure to those items noted above, and depending upon market conditions, we may experience additional losses. Current Business Environment The financial conditions mentioned above continue to negatively affect the economy and the financial services sector in 2008. The slowdown of the economy, significant decline in consumer real estate prices, and the continued and rapid deterioration in the housing sector have affected our home equity portfolio and will, in all likelihood, impact other areas of our consumer portfolio. We expect that certain industry sectors, in particular those that are dependent on the housing sector, and certain geographic regions will experience further stress. For more information on the impact of the current business environment on credit, see the Credit Risk Management discussion beginning on page 44. The subprime mortgage dislocation has also impacted the ratings of certain monoline insurance providers (monolines) which has affected the 10 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents pricing of certain municipal securities and the liquidity of the short term public finance markets. We have direct and indirect exposure to monolines and as a result are continuing to monitor this exposure as the markets evolve. For more information related to our monoline exposure, see the Industry Concentrations discussion on page 54. The above conditions together with uncertainty in energy costs and the overall economic slowdown, which may ultimately lead to recessionary conditions, will affect other markets in which we do business and will adversely impact our results in 2008. The degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions in this rapidly changing business and interest rate environment. For more information on interest rate sensitivity, see the Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities discussion on page 65. Other Recent Events In January 2008, we announced changes in our CMAS business within GCIB which better align the strategy of this business with GCIB broader integrated platform. We will continue to provide corporate, commercial and sponsored clients with debt and equity capital raising services, strategic advice, and a full range of corporate banking capabilities. However, we will reduce activities in certain structured products (e.g., CDOs) and will resize the international platform to emphasize debt, cash management, and selected trading services, including rates and foreign exchange. This realignment will result in the reduction of 650 front office personnel with additional infrastructure headcount reduction to follow. We also plan to sell our equity prime brokerage business. This is in addition to our announcement in October 2007 to eliminate approximately 3,000 positions within various businesses, which includes reductions in GCIB as part of our GCIB business strategic review to enhance the operating platform, reductions in the wholesale mortgage-related business included in GCSBB and reductions in other related infrastructure positions. In August of 2007, we made a $2.0 billion investment in Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide), the largest mortgage lender in the U.S., in the form of Series B non-voting convertible preferred securities yielding 7.25 percent. In January 2008, we announced a definitive agreement to purchase all outstanding shares of Countrywide for approximately $4.0 billion in common stock. The acquisition would make us the nation leading mortgage lender and loan servicer. The closing of this transaction is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2008. In January 2008, the Board of Directors (the Board) declared a regular quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.64 per share, payable on March 28, 2008 to common shareholders of record on March 7, 2008. In October 2007, the Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.64 per share which was paid on December 28, 2007 to common shareholders of record on December 7, 2007. In July 2007, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on common stock 14 percent from $0.56 to $0.64 per share. In January 2008, we issued 240 thousand shares of Bank of America Corporation Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series K with a par value of $0.01 per share for $6.0 billion. The fixed rate is 8.00 percent through January 29, 2018 and then adjusts to three-month LIBOR plus 363 basis points (bps) thereafter. In addition, we issued 6.9 million shares of Bank of America Corporation 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L with a par value of $0.01 per share for $6.9 billion. In November and December of 2007, we issued 41 thousand shares of Bank of America Corporation 7.25% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J with a par value of $0.01 per share for $1.0 billion. In September 2007, we issued 22 thousand shares of Bank of America Corporation 6.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I with a par value of $0.01 per share for $550 million. In December 2007, we completed the sale of Marsico Capital Management, LLC (Marsico), a 100 percent owned investment manager, to Thomas F. Marsico, founder and chief executive officer of Marsico, and realized a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.5 billion. Merger Overview On October 1, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of ABN AMRO North America Holding Company, parent of LaSalle Bank Corporation (LaSalle), for $21.0 billion in cash. With this acquisition, we significantly expanded our presence in metropolitan Chicago, Illinois and Michigan, by adding LaSalle commercial banking clients, retail customers and banking centers. On July 1, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of U.S. Trust Corporation for $3.3 billion in cash. U.S. Trust Corporation focuses exclusively on managing wealth for high net-worth and ultra high net-worth individuals and families. The acquisition significantly increases the size and capabilities of our wealth management business and positions it as one of the largest financial services companies managing private wealth in the U.S. On January 1, 2006, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of MBNA Corporation (MBNA) for $34.6 billion. The acquisition expanded our customer base and opportunity to deepen customer relationships across the full breadth of the Corporation by delivering innovative deposit, lending and investment products and services to MBNA customer base. Additionally, the acquisition allowed us to significantly increase our affinity relationships through MBNA credit card operations and sell these credit cards through our delivery channels including the retail branch network. For more information related to these mergers, see Note 2 Merger and Restructuring Activity to the Corporation Consolidated Financial Statements. 2007 Economic Overview In 2007, notwithstanding significant declines in housing, soaring oil prices and tremendous turmoil in financial markets, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 2.2 percent. Growth softened significantly in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending remained resilient, as increases in employment and wages offset the negative influences of declining home prices. Fueled by another year of strong exports and a slowdown in imports, the U.S. trade deficit fell sharply, lifting U.S. domestic production. However, declines in residential construction subtracted nearly a full percentage point from GDP growth, more than offsetting the boost provided by international trade. Corporate profits declined modestly in the second half of the year from all-time record highs. Global economies recorded their fourth consecutive year of rapid expansion, driven by sustained robust growth in China, India and other emerging market economies. Growth in Europe and Japan moderated in the second half of the year. Higher energy prices pushed up inflation throughout the year. However, excluding food and energy, core inflation receded in the second half of the year, in lagged response to the deceleration of nominal spending growth. A sharp rise in defaults on subprime mortgages and worries about the potential fallout from the faltering housing and subprime mortgage markets triggered financial market turbulence beginning in the summer. A dramatic repricing of credit risk and unprecedented capital losses stemming from sharp declines in the value of structured credit products based on subprime debt deepened the financial crisis. In response, the FRB eased short-term interest rates, reduced the discount rate relative to its federal funds rate target and in December created a new facility for auctioning short-term funds through the discount window of the Federal Reserve Banks. The fourth quarter ended on a weak note, as consumer spending moderated, businesses reduced production, employment slowed and the unemployment rate rose. Bank of America 2007 11 Table of Contents Performance Overview Net income was $15.0 billion, or $3.30 per diluted common share in 2007, decreases of 29 percent and 28 percent from $21.1 billion, or $4.59 per diluted common share in 2006. Table 1 Business Segment Total Revenue and Net Income Total Revenue (1) Net Income (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Global Consumer and Small Business Banking (2) $ 47,682 $ 44,926 $ 9,430 $ 11,378 Global Corporate and Investment Banking 13,417 21,161 538 6,032 Global Wealth and Investment Management 7,923 7,357 2,095 2,223 All Other (2) (954 ) 360 2,919 1,500 Total FTE basis 68,068 73,804 14,982 21,133 FTE adjustment (1,749 ) (1,224 ) Total Consolidated $ 66,319 $ 72,580 $ 14,982 $ 21,133 (1) Total revenue is net of interest expense, and is on a FTE basis for the business segments and All Othe r. For more information on a FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 17. (2) GCSBB is presented on a managed basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other . Global Consumer and Small Business Banking Net income decreased $1.9 billion, or 17 percent, to $9.4 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. Managed net revenue rose $2.8 billion, or six percent, to $47.7 billion driven by increases in both noninterest and net interest income. Noninterest income increased $2.1 billion, or 13 percent, to $18.9 billion driven by higher card, service charge and mortgage banking income. Net interest income increased $612 million, or two percent, to $28.8 billion due to the impacts of organic growth and the LaSalle acquisition on average loans and leases, and deposits. These increases in revenues were more than offset by the increase in provision for credit losses of $4.4 billion, or 51 percent, to $12.9 billion. This increase reflects portfolio growth and seasoning, increases from the unusually low loss levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform, the impact of housing market weakness on the home equity portfolio, and growth and deterioration in the small business portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $1.7 billion, or nine percent, mainly due to increases in personnel and technology-related costs. For more information on GCSBB , see page 21. Global Corporate and Investment Banking Net income decreased $5.5 billion, or 91 percent, to $538 million, and total revenue decreased $7.7 billion, or 37 percent, to $13.4 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. These decreases were driven by $5.6 billion in losses resulting from our CDO exposure and other trading losses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net interest income, primarily market-based, of $1.3 billion, or 14 percent. The provision for credit losses increased $643 million driven by the absence of 2006 releases of reserves, higher net charge-offs and an increase in reserves during 2007 reflecting the impact of the weak housing market particularly on the homebuilder loan portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $347 million, or three percent, mainly due to an increase in expenses related to the addition of LaSalle partially offset by a reduction in CMAS performance-based incentive compensation. For more information on GCIB , see page 25. Global Wealth and Investment Management Net income decreased $128 million, or six percent, to $2.1 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 as an increase in noninterest expense was partially offset by an increase in total revenue. Total revenue grew $566 million, or eight percent, to $7.9 billion driven by higher noninterest income of $380 million. Noninterest income increased due to growth in investment and brokerage services income of $827 million. The increase was due to higher AUM primarily attributable to the impact of the U.S. Trust Corpo- ration acquisition, net client inflows and favorable market conditions combined with an increase in brokerage activity. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in all other income of $447 million due to losses of $382 million associated with the support provided to certain cash funds. Noninterest expense increased $768 million driven by the addition of U.S. Trust Corporation, higher revenue-related expenses and marketing costs. AUM increased $100.6 billion to $643.5 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 reflecting the acquisition of U.S. Trust Corporation, net inflows and market appreciation which was partially offset by the sale of Marsico. For more information on GWIM , see page 31. All Other Net income increased $1.4 billion to $2.9 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. Excluding the securitization offset, total revenue increased $283 million resulting from an increase in noninterest income of $1.6 billion partially offset by a decrease in net interest income of $1.3 billion. The increase in noninterest income was driven by the $1.5 billion gain from the sale of Marsico and an increase of $873 million in equity investment income, partially offset by losses of $394 million on securities after they were purchased from certain cash funds managed within GWIM at fair value. In addition, net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense decreased due to certain international operations that were sold in late 2006 and the beginning of 2007. Merger and restructuring charges decreased $395 million. For more information on All Other, see page 34. Financial Highlights Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $367 million to $36.2 billion for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was driven by the contribution from market-based net interest income related to our CMAS business, higher levels of consumer and commercial loans, the impact of the LaSalle acquisition, and a one-time tax benefit from restructuring our existing non-U.S. based commercial aircraft leasing business. These increases were partially offset by spread compression, increased hedge costs and the impact of divestitures of certain foreign operations in late 2006 and the beginning of 2007. The net interest yield on a FTE basis decreased 22 bps to 2.60 percent for 2007 compared to 2006, and was driven by spread compression, and the impact of the funding of the LaSalle merger, partially offset by an improvement in market-based yield 12 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents related to our CMAS business. For more information on net interest income on a FTE basis, see Tables I and II beginning on page 73. Noninterest Income Table 2 Noninterest Income (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Card income $ 14,077 $ 14,290 Service charges 8,908 8,224 Investment and brokerage services 5,147 4,456 Investment banking income 2,345 2,317 Equity investment income 4,064 3,189 Trading account profits (losses) (5,131 ) 3,166 Mortgage banking income 902 541 Gains (losses) on sales of debt securities 180 (443 ) Other income 1,394 2,249 Total noninterest income $ 31,886 $ 37,989 Noninterest income decreased $6.1 billion to $31.9 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. Card income on a held basis decreased $213 million primarily due to the impact of higher credit losses on excess servicing income resulting from seasoning in the securitized portfolio and increases from the unusually low loss levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform. This decrease was partially offset by increases in cash advance fees and debit card interchange income. Service charges grew $684 million resulting from new account growth in deposit accounts and the beneficial impact of the LaSalle merger. Investment and brokerage services increased $691 million due primarily to organic growth in AUM, brokerage activity and the U.S. Trust Corporation acquisition. Equity investment income increased $875 million driven by the $600 million gain on the sale of private equity funds to Conversus Capital and the increase in income received on strategic investments. Trading account profits (losses) were $(5.1) billion in 2007 compared to $3.2 billion in 2006. The decrease in trading account profits (losses) was driven by losses of $4.9 billion, out of a total of $5.6 billion in losses, associated with CDO exposure and the impact of the market disruptions on various parts of our CMAS businesses in the second half of the year. For more information on the impact of these events refer to the GCIB discussion beginning on page 25. Mortgage banking income increased $361 million due to the favorable performance of the MSRs partially offset by the impact of widening credit spreads on income from mortgage production. Mortgage banking also benefited from the adoption of the fair value option. Gains (losses) on sales of debt securities were $180 million for 2007 compared to $(443) million for 2006. The losses in the prior year were largely a result of the sale of $43.7 billion of mortgage-backed debt securities in the third quarter of 2006. Other income decreased $855 million as the $1.5 billion gain from the sale of Marsico was more than offset by fourth quarter losses of $752 million, out of a total of $5.6 billion in losses associated with our CDO exposure, losses of $394 million on securities after they were purchased from certain cash funds at fair value, losses of $382 million associated with the support provided to certain cash funds managed within GWIM , and the absence of a $720 million gain on the sale of our Brazilian operations recognized in 2006. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $3.4 billion to $8.4 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher net charge-offs, reserve additions and the absence of 2006 commercial reserve releases. Higher net charge-offs of $1.9 billion were primarily driven by seasoning of the consumer portfolios, seasoning and deterioration in the small business and home equity portfolios as well as lower commercial recoveries. Reserves were increased in the home equity and homebuilder loan portfolios on continued weakness in the housing market. Reserves were also added for small business portfolio seasoning and deterioration as well as growth in the consumer portfolios. These increases were partially offset by reductions in reserves from the sale of the Argentina portfolio in the first quarter of 2007. For more information on credit quality, see Provision for Credit Losses beginning on page 58. Noninterest Expense Table 3 Noninterest Expense (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Personnel $ 18,753 $ 18,211 Occupancy 3,038 2,826 Equipment 1,391 1,329 Marketing 2,356 2,336 Professional fees 1,174 1,078 Amortization of intangibles 1,676 1,755 Data processing 1,962 1,732 Telecommunications 1,013 945 Other general operating 5,237 4,580 Merger and restructuring charges 410 805 Total noninterest expense $ 37,010 $ 35,597 Noninterest expense increased $1.4 billion to $37.0 billion in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to increases in personnel expense and other general operating expense partially offset by a decrease in merger and restructuring charges. Personnel expense increased $542 million due to the acquisitions of LaSalle and U.S. Trust Corporation partially offset by a reduction in performance-based incentive compensation within GCIB . Other general operating expense increased by $657 million and was impacted by our acquisitions and various other items including litigation- related costs. Merger and restructuring charges decreased $395 million mainly due to the declining integration costs associated with the MBNA acquisition partially offset by costs associated with the integration of U.S. Trust Corporation and LaSalle. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $5.9 billion in 2007 compared to $10.8 billion in 2006, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.4 percent in 2007 and 33.9 percent in 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower pre-tax income, a one-time tax benefit from restructuring our existing non-U.S. based commercial aircraft leasing business and an increase in the relative percentage of our earnings taxed solely outside of the U.S. In addition, the 2007 effective tax rate excludes the impact of a $175 million charge in 2006 resulting from a change in tax legislation. For more information on income tax expense, see Note 18 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Growth in period end total assets was due to an increase in loans and leases, AFS debt securities and all other assets. The increase in loans and leases was attributable to organic growth and the LaSalle merger. The increases in AFS debt securities and all other assets were driven by the LaSalle merger. The fair value of the assets acquired in the LaSalle merger was approximately $120 billion. All other assets also increased due to higher loans held-for-sale and the fair market value adjustment associated with our investment in China Construction Bank (CCB). Average total assets in 2007 increased $135.4 billion, or nine percent, from 2006 primarily due to the increase in average loans and leases driven by the same factors as described above. Average trading account assets also increased during 2007 reflective of growth in the underlying business in the first half of 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in AFS debt securities. The acquisition of LaSalle occurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 minimizing its impact on the average balance sheet. At December 31, 2007, total liabilities were $1.6 trillion, an increase of $244.5 billion, or 18 percent, from December 31, 2006. Average total liabilities in 2007 increased $129.2 billion, or 10 percent, from 2006. The increase in period end and average total liabilities was attributable to increases in deposits and long-term debt, which were utilized to support the growth in overall assets. In addition, the increase in period end and average total liabilities was due to the funding of, and the assumption of liabilities associated with, the LaSalle merger. The fair value of the liabilities assumed in the LaSalle merger was approximately $100 billion. Trading Account Assets Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed income securities (including government and corporate debt), equity and convertible instruments. The average balance increased $42.0 billion to $187.3 billion in 2007, due to growth in client-driven market-making activities in interest rate, credit and equity products but was negatively impacted by the market disruptions in the second half of 2007. For additional information, see Market Risk Management beginning on page 61. Debt Securities AFS debt securities include fixed income securities such as mortgage-backed securities, foreign debt, ABS, municipal debt, U.S. Government agencies and corporate debt. We use the AFS portfolio primarily to manage interest rate risk and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on these investments. The average balance in the debt securities portfolio decreased $38.8 billion from 2006 due to the third quarter 2006 sale of $43.7 billion of mortgage-backed securities as well as maturities and paydowns. The period end balances were also impacted by the addition of LaSalle. For additional information on our AFS debt securities portfolio, see Market Risk Management Securities on page 66 and Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loans and Leases, Net of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Average loans and leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, was $766.3 billion in 2007, an increase of 19 percent from 2006. The average consumer loan and lease portfolio increased $88.3 billion primarily due to higher retained mortgage production. The average commercial loan and lease portfolio increased $35.4 billion primarily due to organic growth. The average commercial and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans and leases increased due to the addition of loans acquired as a result of the LaSalle merger. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 44, Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Note 7 Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All Other Assets Period end all other assets increased $64.4 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of 23 percent from December 31, 2006, driven primarily by an increase of $15.9 billion in loans held-for-sale and a pre-tax $13.4 billion fair value adjustment associated with our CCB investment. Additionally, the increase in all other assets was impacted by the LaSalle merger. 14 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Deposits Average deposits increased $44.2 billion to $717.2 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a $31.3 billion increase in average domestic interest-bearing deposits and a $16.6 billion increase in average foreign interest-bearing deposits. We categorize our deposits as core or market-based deposits. Core deposits are generally customer-based and represent a stable, low-cost funding source that usually reacts more slowly to interest rate changes than market-based deposits. Core deposits include savings, NOW and money market accounts, consumer CDs and IRAs, and noninterest-bearing deposits. Core deposits exclude negotiable CDs, public funds, other domestic time deposits and foreign interest-bearing deposits. Average core deposits increased $19.3 billion to $593.9 billion in 2007, a three percent increase from the prior year. The increase was attributable to growth in our average consumer CDs and IRAs due to a shift from noninterest-bearing and lower yielding deposits to our higher yielding CDs. Average market-based deposit funding increased $24.9 billion to $123.3 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increases of $16.6 billion in foreign interest-bearing deposits and $8.4 billion in negotiable CDs, public funds and other time deposits related to funding of growth in core and market-based assets. The increase in deposits was also impacted by the assumption of deposits, primarily money market, consumer CDs, and other domestic time deposits associated with the LaSalle merger. Trading Account Liabilities Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in fixed income securities (including government and corporate debt), equity and convertible instruments. The average balance increased $18.0 billion to $82.7 billion in 2007, which was due to growth in client-driven market- making activities in equity products, partially offset by a reduction in usage targets for a variety of client activities. Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide a funding source to supplement deposits in our ALM strategy. The average balance increased $47.1 billion to $171.3 billion in 2007, mainly due to increased commercial paper and Federal Home Loan Bank advances to fund core asset growth, primarily in the ALM portfolio and the funding of the LaSalle acquisition. Long-term Debt Average long-term debt increased $39.7 billion to $169.9 billion. The increase resulted from the funding of core asset growth, and the funding of, and assumption of liabilities associated with, the LaSalle merger. For additional information, see Note 12 Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Shareholders Equity Period end and average shareholders equity increased $11.5 billion and $6.2 billion due to net income, increased net gains in accumulated OCI, including an $8.4 billion, net-of-tax, fair value adjustment relating to our investment in CCB, common stock issued in connection with employee benefit plans, and preferred stock issued. These increases were partially offset by dividend payments, share repurchases and the adoption of certain new accounting standards.

Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently. Operating Basis Presentation In managing our business, we may at times look at performance excluding certain nonrecurring items. For example, as an alternative to net income, we view results on an operating basis, which represents net income excluding merger and restructuring charges. The operating basis of presentation is not defined by GAAP. We believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges, which represent events outside our normal operations, provides a meaningful year-to-year comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations. Net Interest Income FTE Basis In addition, we view net interest income and related ratios and analysis (i.e., efficiency ratio, net interest yield and operating leverage) on a FTE basis. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, we believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Performance Measures As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio, net interest yield and operating leverage utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points we are earning over the cost of funds. Operating leverage measures the total percentage revenue growth minus the total percentage expense growth for the corresponding period. During our annual integrated planning process, we set operating leverage and efficiency targets for the Corporation and each line of business. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Targets vary by year and by business, and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business, investment appetite, competitive environment, market factors, and other items (e.g., risk appetite). The aforementioned performance measures and ratios, return on average assets and dividend payout ratio, as well as those measures discussed more fully below, are presented in Table 6. Return on Average Common Shareholders Equity and Return on Average Tangible Shareholders Equity We also evaluate our business based upon ROE and ROTE measures. ROE and ROTE utilize non-GAAP allocation methodologies. ROE measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders equity allocated to that unit. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of shareholders equity reduced by goodwill. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital) at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation. In addition, profitability, relationship, and investment models all use ROE as key measures to support our overall growth goal.

(3) Represents the impact of securitizations utilizing actual bond costs. This is different from the business segment view which utilizes funds transfer pricing methodologies. Core Net Interest Income Managed Basis We manage core net interest income managed basis, which adjusts reported net interest income on a FTE basis for the impact of market-based activities and certain securitizations, net of retained securities. As discussed in the GCIB business segment section beginning on page 25, we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for CMAS . We also adjust for loans that we originated and subsequently sold into certain securitizations. These securitizations include off-balance sheet loans and leases, primarily credit card securitizations where servicing is retained by the Corporation, but excludes first mortgage securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses, is recorded for assets that have been securitized as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and record servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where appropriate. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation provides additional clarity in managing our results. An analysis of core net interest income managed basis, core average earning assets managed basis and core net interest yield on earning assets managed basis, which adjusts for the impact of these two non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown in the table above. Core net interest income on a managed basis increased $107 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was driven by higher levels of consumer and commercial loans, the impact of the LaSalle acquisition, and a one-time tax benefit from restructuring our existing non-U.S. based commercial aircraft leasing business. These increases were partially offset by spread compression, increased hedge costs and the impact of divestitures of certain foreign operations in late 2006 and the beginning of 2007. On a managed basis, core average earning assets increased $84.1 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to higher levels of consumer and commercial managed loans and increased levels from ALM activities partially offset by a decrease in average balances from the divestitures mentioned above. Core net interest yield on a managed basis decreased 31 bps to 3.82 percent compared to 2006 and was driven by spread compression, higher costs of deposits, the impact of the funding of the LaSalle merger and the sale of certain foreign operations. Business Segment Operations Segment Description We report the results of our operations through three business segments: GCSBB, GCIB and GWIM , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. For more information on our basis of presentation, selected financial information for the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period end total asset amounts, see Note 22 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP methodologies and performance measures, many of which are discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 17. We begin by evaluating the operating results of the businesses which by definition excludes merger and restructuring charges. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies which are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. The management accounting reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue, expense and capital. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. Bank of America 2007 19 Table of Contents Our ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect net interest income. The results of the business segments will fluctuate based on the performance of corporate ALM activities. Some ALM activities are recorded in the businesses ( e.g., Deposits ) such as external product pricing decisions, including deposit pricing strategies, as well as the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process. The net effects of other ALM activities are reported in each of our segments under ALM/Other . In addition, certain residual impacts of the funds transfer pricing process are retained in All Other. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments based on pre-determined means. The most significant of these expenses include data processing costs, item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies which reflect utilization. Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each unit credit, market, interest rate and operational risk components. The Corporation as a whole benefits from risk diversification across the different businesses. This benefit is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment and is recorded in ALM/Other . The nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page 40. Average equity is allocated to the business segments and related businesses, and is impacted by the portion of goodwill that is specifically assigned to the businesses and the unallocated portion of goodwill that resides in ALM/Other. 20 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Global Consumer and Small Business Banking 2007 (Dollars in millions) Total (1) Deposits Card Services (1) Consumer Real Estate (2) ALM/ Other Net interest income (3) $ 28,809 $ 9,423 $ 16,562 $ 2,281 $ 543 Noninterest income: Card income 10,189 2,155 8,028 6 Service charges 6,008 6,003 5 Mortgage banking income 1,333 1,333 All other income 1,343 (4 ) 943 54 350 Total noninterest income 18,873 8,154 8,971 1,398 350 Total revenue, net of interest expense 47,682 17,577 25,533 3,679 893 Provision for credit losses (4) 12,929 256 11,317 1,041 315 Noninterest expense 20,060 9,106 8,294 2,033 627 Income (loss) before income taxes 14,693 8,215 5,922 605 (49 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (3) 5,263 2,988 2,210 234 (169 ) Net income $ 9,430 $ 5,227 $ 3,712 $ 371 $ 120 Net interest yield (3) 8.15 % 2.97 % 7.87 % 2.04 % n/m Return on average equity (5) 14.94 33.61 8.43 9.00 n/m Efficiency ratio (3) 42.07 51.81 32.49 55.24 n/m Period end total assets (6) $ 442,987 $ 358,626 $ 257,000 $ 133,324 n/m 2006 (Dollars in millions) Total (1) Deposits Card Services (1) Consumer Real Estate (2) ALM/ Other Net interest income (3) $ 28,197 $ 9,405 $ 16,357 $ 1,994 $ 441 Noninterest income: Card income 9,374 1,907 7,460 7 Service charges 5,342 5,338 4 Mortgage banking income 877 877 All other income 1,136 1 819 27 289 Total noninterest income 16,729 7,246 8,279 915 289 Total revenue, net of interest expense 44,926 16,651 24,636 2,909 730 Provision for credit losses (4) 8,534 165 8,089 63 217 Noninterest expense 18,375 8,783 7,519 1,718 355 Income before income taxes 18,017 7,703 9,028 1,128 158 Income tax expense (3) 6,639 2,840 3,328 416 55 Net income $ 11,378 $ 4,863 $ 5,700 $ 712 $ 103 Net interest yield (3) 8.20 % 2.93 % 8.52 % 2.19 % n/m Return on average equity (5) 18.11 33.42 12.90 22.18 n/m Efficiency ratio (3) 40.90 52.75 30.52 59.06 n/m Period end total assets (6) $ 399,373 $ 339,717 $ 235,106 $ 101,175 n/m (1) Presented on a managed basis, specifically Card Services .

We achieve this strategy through our ability to offer a wide range of products and services through a franchise that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia. We also provide credit card products to customers in Canada, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., we serve approximately 59 million consumer and small business relationships utilizing our network of 6,149 banking centers, 18,753 domestic branded ATMs, and telephone and Internet channels. Within GCSBB , there are three primary businesses: Deposits, Card Services , and Consumer Real Estate . In addition, ALM/Other includes the results of ALM activities and other consumer-related businesses (e.g., insurance). GCSBB , specifically Card Services , is presented on a managed basis. For a reconciliation of managed GCSBB to held GCSBB , see Note 22 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2007, Visa Inc. filed a registration statement with the SEC with respect to a proposed IPO. Subject to market conditions and other factors, Visa Inc. expects the IPO to occur in the first half of 2008. We expect to record a gain associated with the IPO. In addition, we expect that a portion of the proceeds from the IPO will be used by Visa Inc. to fund liabilities arising from litigation which would allow us to record an offset to the litigation liabilities that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 as discussed below. Net income decreased $1.9 billion, or 17 percent, to $9.4 billion compared to 2006 as increases in noninterest income and net interest income were more than offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $612 million, or two percent, to $28.8 billion due to the impacts of organic growth and the LaSalle acquisition on average loans and leases, and deposits compared to 2006. Noninterest income increased $2.1 billion, or 13 percent, to $18.9 billion compared to the same period in 2006, mainly due to increases in card income, service charges and mortgage banking income. Provision for credit losses increased $4.4 billion, or 51 percent, to $12.9 billion compared to 2006. This increase primarily resulted from a $3.2 billion increase in Card Services and a $978 million increase in Consumer Real Estate . For further discussion of the increase in provision for credit losses related to Card Services and Consumer Real Estate , see their respective discussions. Noninterest expense increased $1.7 billion, or nine percent, to $20.1 billion largely due to increases in personnel-related expenses, Visa-related litigation costs, equally allocated to Card Services and Treasury Services on a management accounting basis, and technology related costs. For additional information on Visa-related litigation, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deposits Deposits provides a comprehensive range of products to consumers and small businesses. Our products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest and interest-bearing checking accounts. Debit card results are also included in Deposits . Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenues from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending activity and our ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generate fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient fund fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, while debit cards generate merchant interchange fees based on purchase volume. Excluding accounts obtained through acquisitions, we added approximately 2.3 million net new retail checking accounts in 2007. These additions resulted from continued improvement in sales and service results in the Banking Center Channel and Online, and the success of such products as Keep the Change TM , Risk Free CDs, Balance Rewards and Affinity. We continue to migrate qualifying affluent customers and their related deposit balances from GCSBB to GWIM . In 2007, a total of $11.4 billion of deposits were migrated from GCSBB to GWIM compared to $10.7 billion in 2006. After migration, the associated net interest income, service charges and noninterest expense are recorded in GWIM . Net income increased $364 million, or seven percent, to $5.2 billion compared to 2006 as an increase in noninterest income was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income remained relatively flat at $9.4 billion compared to 2006 as the addition of LaSalle and higher deposit spreads resulting from disciplined pricing were offset by the impact of lower balances. Average deposits decreased $3.2 billion, or one percent, largely due to the migration of customer relationships and related balances to GWIM , partially offset by the acquisition of LaSalle. The increase in noninterest income was driven by higher service charges of $665 million, or 12 percent, primarily as a result of new demand deposit account growth and the addition of LaSalle. Additionally, debit card revenue growth of $248 million, or 13 percent, was due to a higher number of checking accounts, increased usage, the addition of LaSalle and market penetration (i.e., increase in the number of existing account holders with debit cards). Noninterest expense increased $323 million, or four percent, to $9.1 billion compared to 2006, primarily due to the addition of LaSalle, and to higher account and transaction volumes. Card Services Card Services, which excludes the results of debit cards (included in Deposits ), provides a broad offering of products, including U.S. Consumer and Business Card, Unsecured Lending, and International Card. We offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit card products and have become the leading issuer of credit cards through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe. During 2007, Merchant Services was transferred to Treasury Services within GCIB. Previously their results were reported in Card Services. Prior period amounts have been reclassified. 22 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents The Corporation reports its GCSBB results, specifically Card Services , on a managed basis, which is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of GCSBB . Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the Corporation to diversify funding sources. Loan securitization removes loans from the Consolidated Balance Sheet through the sale of loans to an off-balance sheet QSPE which is excluded from the Corporation Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. Securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition, excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans. Net income decreased $2.0 billion, or 35 percent, to $3.7 billion compared to 2006 as growth in noninterest income and net interest income was more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $205 million, or one percent, to $16.6 billion as an increase in managed average loans and leases of $18.5 billion was partially offset by spread compression. Noninterest income increased $692 million, or eight percent, to $9.0 billion mainly due to higher cash advance fees related to organic loan growth in domestic credit card and unsecured lending. All other income increased $124 million primarily due to higher foreign revenues. Provision for credit losses increased $3.2 billion, or 40 percent, to $11.3 billion compared to 2006. The increase was primarily driven by higher managed net losses from portfolio seasoning and increases from unusually low loss levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform. The higher provision was also driven by reserve increases in our small business portfolio reflective of growth in the business and portfolio deterioration. In addition, higher provision was due to seasoning of the unsecured lending portfolio. These increases in provision were partially offset by a higher level of reserve reduction from the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitization trust. Noninterest expense increased $775 million, or 10 percent, to $8.3 billion compared to 2006, largely due to increases in personnel-related expenses, Card Services allocation of the Visa-related litigation costs and technology related costs. For additional information on Visa-related litigation, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) Includes U.S. consumer card and foreign credit card. Does not include business card and unsecured lending. The table above and the discussion below presents select key indicators for the Card Services and credit card portfolios. Managed Card Services net losses increased $2.9 billion to $10.1 billion, or 4.81 percent of average outstandings, compared to $7.2 billion, or 3.78 percent (3.93 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. This increase was primarily driven by portfolio seasoning and increases from the unusually low loss levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform. Managed Card Services total average loans and leases increased $18.5 billion to $209.8 billion compared to the same period in 2006, driven by growth in the unsecured lending, foreign and domestic card portfolios. Managed credit card net losses increased $1.8 billion to $8.2 billion, or 4.79 percent of average credit card outstandings, compared to $6.4 billion, or 3.90 percent (3.99 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. The increase was driven by portfolio seasoning and increases from the unusually low loss levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform. Managed credit card total average loans and leases increased $8.0 billion to $171.4 billion compared to the same period in 2006. The increase was driven by growth in the foreign and domestic portfolios. For more information on credit quality, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management beginning on page 45. Bank of America 2007 23 Table of Contents Consumer Real Estate Consumer Real Estate generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. Consumer Real Estate products are available to our customers through a retail network of personal bankers located in 6,149 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in nearly 200 locations and through a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. Consumer Real Estate products include fixed and adjustable rate loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, lines of credit and home equity loans. Mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while retaining the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet for ALM purposes. Consumer Real Estate is not impacted by the Corporation mortgage production retention decisions as Consumer Real Estate is compensated for the decision on a management accounting basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other . The Consumer Real Estate business includes the origination, fulfillment, sale and servicing of first mortgage loan products, reverse mortgage products and home equity products. Servicing activities primarily include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties. Servicing income includes ancillary income derived in connection with these activities such as late fees. Within GCSBB , the Consumer Real Estate first mortgage and home equity production were $93.3 billion and $69.2 billion for 2007 compared to $76.9 billion and $67.9 billion in 2006. During the second quarter of 2007, the Corporation completed the purchase of a reverse mortgage business which increased the Corporation offerings of reverse mortgages. Net income for Consumer Real Estate decreased $341 million to $371 million compared to 2006 as increases in mortgage banking income and net interest income were more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income grew $287 million, or 14 percent, to $2.3 billion and was driven by loan balances in our home equity business partially offset by spread compression. Average loans and leases increased $20.7 billion, or 24 percent. The increase in mortgage banking income of $456 million, or 52 percent, to $1.3 billion was primarily due to the election under SFAS 159 to account for certain mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value, favorable performance of the MSRs and increased production income partially offset by widening of credit spreads during the year. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159 on January 1, 2007, mortgage loan origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings when incurred. Previously, mortgage loan origination fees and costs would have been capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income upon the sale of such loans. For more information on the adoption of SFAS 159 on mortgage banking income, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 68. Noninterest expense increased $315 million, or 18 percent, to $2.0 billion compared to 2006, driven by costs associated with increased volume and the increase in cost related to the adoption of SFAS 159 as discussed above. Provision for credit losses increased $978 million to $1.0 billion compared to 2006. This increase was driven by higher losses inherent in the home equity portfolio reflective of portfolio seasoning and the impacts of the weak housing market, particularly in geographic areas which have experienced the most significant home price declines driving a reduction in collateral value. The Consumer Real Estate servicing portfolio includes loans serviced for others, and originated and retained residential mortgages. The servicing portfolio at December 31, 2007 was $516.9 billion, $97.4 billion higher than at December 31, 2006, driven by production. Included in this amount was $259.5 billion of residential first mortgage loans serviced for others. At December 31, 2007, the residential first mortgage MSR balance was $3.1 billion, an increase of $184 million, or six percent, from December 31, 2006. This value represented 118 bps of the related unpaid principal balance, a seven bps decrease from December 31, 2006. ALM/Other ALM/Other is comprised primarily of the allocation of a portion of the Corporation net interest income from ALM activities and the results of other consumer-related businesses (e.g., insurance). Net income increased $17 million compared to 2006 as higher contributions from ALM activities were offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Provision for credit losses increased $98 million to $315 million compared to 2006. This increase was driven by higher losses inherent in the small business lending portfolio managed outside of Card Services.

GCIB provides a wide range of financial services to both our issuer and investor clients that range from business banking clients to large international corporate and institutional investor clients using a strategy to deliver value-added financial products and advisory solutions. GCIB products and services are delivered from three primary businesses: Business Lending, CMAS , and Treasury Services , and are provided to our clients through a global team of client relationship managers and product partners. In addition, ALM/Other includes the results of ALM activities and other GCIB activities (e.g., Commercial Insurance business which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2007). Our clients are supported through offices in 22 countries that are divided into four distinct geographic regions: U.S. and Canada; Asia; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and Latin America. For more information on our foreign operations, see Foreign Portfolio beginning on page 56. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted SFAS 159 and elected to account for loans and loan commitments to certain large corporate clients at fair value. For more information on the adoption of SFAS 159, see Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements and see page 49 for a discussion of loans and loan commitments measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159. The results of loans and loan commitments to certain large corporate clients for which the Corporation elected the fair value option (including the associated risk mitigation tools) are recorded in CMAS . Net income decreased $5.5 billion, or 91 percent, to $538 million and total revenue decreased $7.7 billion, or 37 percent, to $13.4 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. These decreases were driven by $5.6 billion of losses resulting from our CDO exposure and other trading losses. Additionally, we experienced increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, which were partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Net interest income increased $1.3 billion, or 14 percent, due to higher market-based net interest income of $1.1 billion and the FTE impact of a one-time tax benefit from restructuring our existing non-U.S. based commercial aircraft leasing business. Additionally, the benefit of growth in average loans and leases of $41.4 billion, or 18 percent, was partially offset by spread compression on core lending and deposit-related activities, and a change in the mix between interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits as clients maintained lower noninterest-bearing compensating balances by shifting to interest bearing and/or higher yielding investment alternatives. The growth in average loans and average deposits was due to organic growth as well as the LaSalle merger. Noninterest income decreased $9.1 billion, or 81 percent, in 2007 compared to 2006, driven by declines in trading account profits (losses) of $8.1 billion and all other income of $1.1 billion. For more information on these decreases, see the CMAS discussion. Provision for credit losses was $652 million in 2007 compared to $9 million in 2006. The increase was driven by the absence of 2006 releases of reserves, higher net charge-offs and an increase in reserves during 2007 reflecting the impact of the weak housing market particularly on the homebuilder loan portfolio. Net charge-offs increased in the retail automotive and other dealer-related portfolios due to growth, seasoning and deterioration, as well as from a lower level of commercial recoveries. Noninterest expense increased $347 million, or three percent, mainly due to the addition of LaSalle and Visa-related litigation costs, equally allocated to Treasury Services and Card Services on a management accounting basis, partially offset by a reduction in performance-based incentive compensation in CMAS . For additional information on Visa- related litigation, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Lending Business Lending provides a wide range of lending-related products and services to our clients through client relationship teams along with various product partners. Products include commercial and corporate bank loans and commitment facilities which cover our business banking clients, middle market commercial clients and our large multinational corporate clients. Real estate lending products are issued primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and commercial real estate firms. Leasing and asset-based lending products offer our clients innovative financing solutions. Products also include indirect consumer loans which allow us to offer financing through automotive, marine, motorcycle and recreational vehicle dealerships across the U.S. Business Lending also contains the results for the economic hedging of our risk to certain credit counterparties utilizing various risk mitigation tools. Net income decreased $128 million, or six percent, to $2.1 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 as increases in net interest income and noninterest income were more than offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $445 million, or 10 percent, driven by the FTE impact of approximately $350 million related to a one-time tax benefit from restructuring our existing non-U.S. based commercial aircraft leasing business, and average loan growth of 14 percent. These increases were partially offset by the impact of spread compression on the loan portfolio. The increase in average loans and leases was attributable to growth in commercial loans, the LaSalle merger and increases in the indirect consumer loan portfolio related to bulk purchases of retail automotive loans. The increase in noninterest income of $112 million, or 11 percent, was driven by improved economic hedging results of our exposures to certain large corporate clients and higher tax credits from community development activities partially offset by derivative fair value adjustments related to an option to purchase retail automotive loans. Provision for credit losses was $647 million in 2007 compared to negative $2 million in 2006. The increase was driven by the absence of 2006 releases of reserves related to favorable commercial credit market conditions, higher net charge-offs and an increase in reserves during 2007 reflecting the impact of the weak housing market particularly on the homebuilder loan portfolio. Net charge-offs increased in 2007 as retail automotive and other dealer-related portfolio losses rose due to growth, 26 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents seasoning and deterioration, and the level of commercial recoveries declined. Noninterest expense increased $111 million, or five percent, primarily due to the LaSalle merger. Capital Markets and Advisory Services CMAS provides financial products, advisory services and financing globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate issuer clients to provide debt and equity underwriting and distribution capabilities, merger-related advisory services and risk management solutions using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed income and mortgage-related products. The business may take positions in these products and participate in market-making activities dealing in government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and ABS. Underwriting debt and equity, securities research and certain market-based activities are executed through Banc of America Securities, LLC which is a primary dealer in the U.S. In January 2008, we announced changes in our CMAS business which better align the strategy of this business with GCIB broader integrated platform. We will continue to provide corporate, commercial and sponsored clients with debt and equity capital-raising services, strategic advice, and a full range of corporate banking capabilities. We will reduce activities in certain structured products (e.g., CDOs) and will resize the international platform to emphasize debt, cash management, and trading services, including rates and foreign exchange. The realignment will result in the reduction of front office personnel with additional infrastructure headcount reduction to follow. We also plan to sell our equity prime brokerage business. CMAS evaluates its results using market-based revenue that is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income. The following table presents further detail regarding market-based revenue. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed income from liquid products (primarily interest rate and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and public finance), credit products (primarily investment and noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations and credit derivatives), structured products (primarily CMBS, residential mortgage-backed securities, structured credit trading and CDOs), and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

A variety of factors influence results including volume of activity, the degree in which we successfully anticipate market movements, and how our hedges perform in the various markets. During the second half of 2007, extreme dislocations emerged in the financial markets, including leveraged finance, subprime mortgage, and the commercial paper markets, and these dislocations were further compounded by the decoupling of typical correlations in the various markets in which we participate. These conditions created less liquidity, a flight to quality, greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the credit ratings of certain structured securities (e.g., CDOs) were downgraded which among other things triggered further widening of credit spreads for this type of security. We have been an active participant in the CDO market, maintain ongoing exposure to these securities and incurred losses associated with these exposures. Many of these conditions continued into 2008 and it is unclear how long these conditions and the overall economic slowdown may continue and what impact they will ultimately have on our results. CMAS recognized a net loss of $3.4 billion in 2007, a decrease of $5.0 billion, compared to 2006 driven by a decrease in market-based revenue of $8.2 billion. The decrease was driven by $5.6 billion of losses resulting from our CDO exposure and other trading losses. Partially offsetting this decrease was a reduction in noninterest expense due to lower performance-based incentive compensation. Investment banking income increased $61 million to $2.5 billion due to growth in advisory fees. This growth was driven by increased market activity primarily in the first half of the year partially offset by reduced debt underwriting fees that were affected by the market disruptions during the second half of the year which included the utilization of fees to distribute leveraged loan commitments. Sales and trading revenue declined $8.3 billion to a loss of $2.3 billion in 2007. While structured products and credit products reported losses for 2007, liquid products and equities compared reasonably well with 2006 given the market conditions. Liquid products revenue decreased $47 million as the negative impact of spread widening and correlations breaking down (e.g., correlation between certain municipal market indices and bond market swap spreads) were partially offset by the strength in interest rate products and foreign exchange contracts. Credit products losses were $537 million, a decline in revenue of $1.4 billion compared to 2006. Losses resulted from positions taken in the market as a result of customer market making activities as the widening of spreads during the second half of the year had a negative impact on these positions. In addition, certain indices became extremely volatile and diverged from other related indices and from single name credit risk (bonds, loans or derivatives) in our portfolio. This negatively impacted our hedging of portfolios of single name credits with derivatives based on these indices. One example of this divergence was the widening of the spread between the investment grade cash and the credit derivative markets. In addition, losses also resulted from positions taken in the market as the widening of spreads during the second half of the year had a negative impact on these positions. We also incurred losses of $292 million, net of $471 million of fees, on leveraged loans, loan commitments and the Corporation share of the leveraged forward calendar. Losses incurred on our leveraged exposure were not concentrated in any one type (senior secured, covenant light or subordinated/senior unsecured) and were generally due to wider new issuance credit spreads. Since the negotiated spreads were lower than the then current new issuance spread, a fair value loss Bank of America 2007 27 Table of Contents resulted. In several instances, commitments were either terminated by the client or interest rate concessions (e.g., an increase in the stated coupon) were obtained from the borrowers, thereby increasing the value of the loans, in each case negating the need for any writedown. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation share of the leveraged finance forward calendar that consisted primarily of senior secured exposure was $12.2 billion and our funded position held for distribution was $6.1 billion. In addition, we had limited investment grade exposure that was in line with our normal exposure levels. Structured products losses were $5.2 billion, with a decline in revenue of $6.6 billion in 2007 compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by $5.6 billion of losses resulting from our CDO exposure, $125 million of losses on CMBS funded debt and the forward calendar and $875 million related to other structured products. See the detailed CDO exposure discussion to follow. Other structured products, including residential mortgage-backed securities and structured credit trading, were negatively impacted by spread widening due to the credit market disruptions during the second half of the year and by the breakdown of the expected hedge correlations. For example, the divergence in valuation of agency-based mortgage products, principally derivatives and forward sales contracts, used to economically hedge non-agency mortgage exposure resulted in losses on our residential mortgage-backed securities trading positions. At the end of the year, we held $13.7 billion of funded CMBS debt of which $6.9 billion were floating-rate acquisition related financings to major, well known operating companies. In addition, we had a forward calendar of just over $2.0 billion of which $1.1 billion were floating-rate acquisition related financings. Equity products revenue decreased $273 million primarily due to lower client activity in equity capital markets and equity derivatives combined with reduced trading results. Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure at December 31, 2007 CDO vehicles are special purpose entities that hold diversified pools of fixed income securities. CDO vehicles issue multiple tranches of debt securities, including commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. We receive fees for structuring CDO vehicles and/or placing debt securities with third party investors as part of our structured credit products business. Our CDO exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts), warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information on our CDO liquidity commitments refer to Collateralized Debt Obligations as part of Off- and On-Balance Sheet Arrangements beginning on page 35. Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated securities, issued by the CDO vehicles. 28 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents The following table presents our super senior CDO exposure at December 31, 2007.

(2) Includes highly-rated CLO and CMBS super senior exposure. (3) Net of insurance. (4) For additional information on our super senior liquidity exposure of $12.3 billion, see the CDO discussion beginning on page 37. At December 31, 2007, super senior exposure, net of writedowns, of $11.6 billion in the form of cash positions, liquidity commitments, and derivative contracts consisted of net subprime super senior exposure of approximately $8.2 billion and net non-subprime super senior exposure of $3.5 billion. During 2007, we recorded losses of $4.0 billion associated with our subprime super senior CDO exposure. The losses reduced trading account profits (losses) by approximately $3.2 billion and other income by approximately $750 million. In addition, we incurred approximately $1.1 billion in losses related to subprime sales and trading positions, approximately $300 million related to our CDO warehouse, and approximately $200 million to cover counterparty risk on the insured CDOs. For more information on our super senior liquidity exposure, see the CDO discussion beginning on page 37. Our net subprime super senior liquidity commitments were $4.8 billion where we have recorded losses of $2.7 billion. The collateral supporting the high grade exposure consisted of about 60 percent subprime of which approximately 65 percent was made up of 2006 and 2007 vintages while the remaining amount was comprised of higher quality vintages from 2005 and prior. The mezzanine exposure is collateralized with about 40 percent of subprime assets of which approximately 60 percent are of higher quality vintages from 2005 and prior. The CDOs-squared exposure is supported by approximately 75 percent of subprime collateral, the majority of which were later vintages. Our net other subprime super senior exposure was $3.4 billion where we have recorded losses of $1.3 billion. Other subprime super senior exposure consists primarily of our cash and derivative positions including the unfunded commitments. The collateral underlying the high grade exposure is similar to our high grade collateral discussed above. The mezzanine exposure underlying collateral was heavily weighted to subprime with approximately 65 percent coming from later vintages while the CDOs-squared collateral was made up of approximately 50 percent subprime assets comprised of later vintages. We also had net non-subprime super senior CDO exposure of $3.5 billion which primarily included highly-rated CLO and CMBS super senior exposures. The net non-subprime super senior exposure is comprised of $3.0 billion of super senior liquidity commitment exposure and $458 million of high grade other super senior exposure. We recorded losses of $57 million associated with these exposures. These losses were primarily driven by spread widening rather than impairment of principal. In addition to the table above, we also had CDO exposure with a market value of approximately $815 million in our CDO warehouse of which $314 million was classified as subprime, and CDO exposure of approximately $1.0 billion related to our sales and trading activities of which $279 million was classified as subprime. The subprime exposure related to our CDO warehouse and sales and trading activities is carried at approximately 30 percent of par value. As mentioned above, during the fourth quarter, the credit ratings of certain CDO structures were downgraded which among other things triggered widening of credit spreads for this type of security. CDO-related markets experienced significant liquidity constraints impacting the availability and reliability of transparent pricing. We subsequently valued these CDO structures assuming they would terminate and looked through the structures to the underlying net asset values supported by the underlying securities. We were able to obtain security values using external pricing services for approximately 70 percent of the CDO exposure for which we used the average of all prices obtained by security. The majority of the remaining positions where no pricing quotes were available were valued using matrix pricing by aligning the value to securities that had similar vintage of underlying assets and ratings, using the lowest rating between the rating services. The remaining securities were valued using projected cash flows, similar to the valuation of an interest-only strip, based on Bank of America 2007 29 Table of Contents estimated average life, seniority level and vintage of underlying assets. We assigned a zero value to the CDO positions for which an event of default had been triggered. The value of cash held by the trustee for all CDO structures was also incorporated into the resulting net asset value. At December 31, 2007, we held $5.1 billion of purchased insurance on our CDO exposure of which 66 percent was provided by monolines in the form of CDS, total-return-swaps (TRS) or financial guarantees. The majority of this purchased insurance relates to the high grade super senior exposure. In the case of default we will first look to the underlying securities and then to recovery on purchased insurance. We valued these contracts by referencing the fair value of the CDO and subsequently adjusted these fair values downward by $200 million due to counterparty credit risk. For more information on our credit exposure to monolines, see Industry Concentrations beginning on page 54. Treasury Services Treasury Services provides integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients worldwide through our network of proprietary offices and special clearing arrangements. Our clients include multinationals, middle-market companies, correspondent banks, commercial real estate firms and governments. Our products and services include treasury management, trade finance, foreign exchange, short-term credit facilities and short-term investing options. Net interest income is derived from interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits, sweep investments, and other liability management products. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenues from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending activity and our ALM activities. The revenue is attributed to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Noninterest income is generated from payment and receipt products, merchant services, wholesale card products, and trade services and is comprised largely of service charges which are net of market-based earnings credit rates applied against noninterest-bearing deposits. During 2007, Merchant Services was transferred to Treasury Services . Previously, these results were reported in Card Services in GCSBB . Prior period amounts have been reclassified. Net income decreased $237 million, or 10 percent, in 2007 compared to 2006 driven by the increase in noninterest expense combined with a decrease in revenue. Net interest income decreased $64 million, or two percent, due to the negative impact of a change in the mix between interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits as clients maintained lower noninterest-bearing compensating balances by shifting to interest-bearing and/or higher yielding investment alternatives, and spread compression resulting from the rate environment and competitive pricing. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in average deposits of $7.3 billion due to organic growth as well as the LaSalle merger. Noninterest income was relatively flat at $3.3 billion as the increase in service charges was more than offset by the decrease in all other income. Service charges increased $102 million due to organic growth, including the impact of deposit product shifts mentioned above, providing a partial offset to lower net interest income. All other income decreased $131 million due to the sale of a business related to our merchant services activities in the prior year. Noninterest expense increased $295 million, or eight percent, mainly due to Treasury Services allocation of the Visa-related litigation costs and the addition of LaSalle. ALM/Other ALM/Other includes an allocation of a portion of the Corporation net interest income from ALM activities as well as our Commercial Insurance business. Net income decreased $90 million, or 46 percent, in 2007 compared to 2006 mainly due to a decrease in net interest income of $167 million, resulting from a lower contribution from the Corporation ALM activities, and increased noninterest expense partially offset by an increase in all other income. All other income increased $122 million due to the sale of our Commercial Insurance business in the fourth quarter of 2007. Noninterest expense increased $98 million due to severance costs associated with the GCIB strategic review implemented in 2007 as well as increased occupancy costs. 30 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Global Wealth and Investment Management 2007 (Dollars in millions) Total U.S. Trust (1) Columbia Management Premier Banking and Investments ALM/ Other Net interest income (2) $ 3,857 $ 1,036 $ 15 $ 2,655 $ 151 Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 4,210 1,226 1,857 950 177 All other income (144 ) 57 (366 ) 146 19 Total noninterest income 4,066 1,283 1,491 1,096 196 Total revenue, net of interest expense 7,923 2,319 1,506 3,751 347 Provision for credit losses 14 (14 ) 27 1 Noninterest expense 4,635 1,592 1,196 1,700 147 Income before income taxes 3,274 741 310 2,024 199 Income tax expense (2) 1,179 274 114 749 42 Net income $ 2,095 $ 467 $ 196 $ 1,275 $ 157 Net interest yield (2) 3.06 % 2.69 % n/m 2.70 % n/m Return on average equity (3) 18.87 17.25 11.29 % 72.44 n/m Efficiency ratio (2) 58.50 68.67 79.39 45.31 n/m Period end total assets (4) $ 157,157 $ 51,044 $ 2,617 $ 113,329 n/m 2006 (Dollars in millions) Total U.S. Trust (1) Columbia Management Premier Banking and Investments ALM/ Other Net interest income (2) $ 3,671 $ 902 $ (37 ) $ 2,552 $ 254 Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 3,383 914 1,532 778 159 All other income 303 80 44 125 54 Total noninterest income 3,686 994 1,576 903 213 Total revenue, net of interest expense 7,357 1,896 1,539 3,455 467 Provision for credit losses (39 ) (52 ) 12 1 Noninterest expense 3,867 1,233 1,014 1,560 60 Income before income taxes 3,529 715 525 1,883 406 Income tax expense (2) 1,306 265 194 697 150 Net income $ 2,223 $ 450 $ 331 $ 1,186 $ 256 Net interest yield (2) 3.50 % 2.94 % n/m 2.98 % n/m Return on average equity (3) 22.28 30.43 20.42 % 70.57 n/m Efficiency ratio (2) 52.57 65.04 65.88 45.15 n/m Period end total assets (4) $ 125,287 $ 33,648 $ 3,082 $ 93,992 n/m (1) In July 2007, the operations of the acquired U.S. Trust Corporation were combined with the former Private Bank creating U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management .

GWIM provides a wide offering of customized banking, investment and brokerage services tailored to meet the changing wealth management goals of our individual and institutional customer base. Our clients have access to a range of services offered through three primary businesses: U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust); Columbia Management (Columbia) ; and Premier Banking and Investments (PB&I) . In addition, ALM/Other primarily includes the results of ALM activities. In December of 2007, we completed the sale of Marsico and realized a pre-tax gain on this transaction of approximately $1.5 billion recognized in All Other . The business results prior to the closing of the Marsico sale are reflected within the Columbia business. Net income decreased $128 million, or six percent, to $2.1 billion in 2007, due mainly to losses associated with the support provided to certain cash funds managed within Columbia and an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $186 million, or five percent, to $3.9 billion driven by the impact of the U.S. Trust Corporation acquisition and organic growth in average deposit and loan balances. The growth in balances was partially offset by spread compression and a shift in the deposit product mix. GWIM deposit growth benefited from the migration of customer relationships and related balances from GCSBB, organic growth and the U.S. Trust Corporation acquisition. A more detailed discussion regarding migrated customer relationships and related balances is provided in the PB&I discussion. Noninterest income increased $380 million, or 10 percent, to $4.1 billion driven by an increase in investment and brokerage services of $827 million, or 24 percent. This increase was due to higher AUM primarily attributable to the impact of the U.S. Trust Corporation acquisition, net client inflows and favorable market conditions combined with an increase in brokerage activity. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in all other income due to losses associated with the support provided to certain cash funds managed within Columbia . Noninterest expense increased $768 million, or 20 percent, to $4.6 billion driven by the addition of U.S. Trust Corporation, higher revenue-related expenses and increased marketing costs. Client Assets The following table presents client assets which consist of AUM, client brokerage assets and assets in custody. Client Assets December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Assets under management $ 643,531 $ 542,977 Client brokerage assets (1) 222,661 203,799 Assets in custody 167,575 107,902 Less: Client brokerage assets and assets in custody included in assets under management (87,071 ) (67,509 ) Total net client assets $ 946,696 $ 787,169 (1) Client brokerage assets include non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets. AUM increased $100.6 billion, or 19 percent, to $643.5 billion as of December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, driven by the U.S. Trust Corporation acquisition, which contributed $115.6 billion, as well as net inflows and market appreciation partially offset by the sale of Marsico, which resulted in a decrease of $60.9 billion. As of December 31, 2007, client brokerage assets increased by $18.9 billion, or nine percent, to $222.7 billion compared to the same period in 2006, driven by increased brokerage activity. Assets in custody increased $59.7 billion, or 55 percent, to $167.6 billion compared to the same period in 2006, driven mainly by U.S. Trust Corporation which contributed $45.0 billion. U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management In July 2007, we completed the acquisition of U.S. Trust Corporation for $3.3 billion in cash combining it with The Private Bank and its ultra-wealthy extension, Family Wealth Advisors , to form U.S. Trust. The results of the combined business were reported for periods beginning on July 1, 2007. Prior to July 1, 2007, the results solely reflect that of the former Private Bank . U.S. Trust provides comprehensive wealth management solutions to wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $3 million. In addition, U.S. Trust provides resources and customized solutions to meet clients wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking services as well as specialty asset management services (oil and gas, real estate, farm and ranch, timberland, private businesses and tax advisory). Clients also benefit from access to resources available through the Corporation including capital markets products, large and complex financing solutions, and its extensive banking platform. Net income increased $17 million, or four percent, compared to 2006, to $467 million due to higher total revenue partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $134 million due to the acquisition of U.S. Trust Corporation and organic growth in average loans and leases and average deposits. This increase was partially offset by spread compression and the shift in deposit product mix. Growth in noninterest income was driven by a $312 million increase in investment and brokerage services related to acquisitions and organic growth. Noninterest expense increased $359 million to $1.6 billion driven by acquisitions and higher personnel-related expenses. Columbia Management Columbia is an asset management business serving the needs of both institutional clients and individual customers. Columbia provides asset management products and services, including mutual funds and separate accounts. Columbia mutual fund offerings provide a broad array of investment strategies and products including equity, fixed income (taxable and nontaxable) and money market (taxable and nontaxable) funds. Columbia distributes its products and services directly to institutional clients, and distributes to individuals through U.S. Trust, PB&I and nonproprietary channels including other brokerage firms. 32 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents In December 2007, we completed the sale of Marsico and realized a pre-tax gain on this transaction of approximately $1.5 billion recognized in All Other . The business results prior to the closing of the Marsico sale are reflected within the Columbia business. Net income decreased $135 million, or 41 percent, to $196 million driven by a decrease of $410 million in all other income. This decrease was due primarily to losses associated with the support provided to certain cash funds. Partially offsetting this decrease was higher investment and brokerage services income of $325 million driven by the contribution from the U.S. Trust Corporation acquisition, net client inflows and favorable market conditions. We provided support to certain cash funds managed within Columbia . The funds for which we provided support typically invest in high quality, short-term securities with a weighted average maturity of 90 days or less, including a limited number of securities issued by SIVs. Due to market disruptions, certain SIV investments were downgraded by the rating agencies and experienced a decline in fair value. We entered into capital commitments which required the Corporation to provide up to $565 million in cash to the funds in the event the net asset value per unit of a fund declines below certain thresholds. The capital commitments expire no later than the third quarter of 2010. At December 31, 2007, losses of $382 million had been recognized and $183 million is still outstanding associated with this capital commitment. Additionally, we purchased SIV investments from the funds at their fair value of $561 million. Losses of $394 million on these investments were recorded within All Other due to declines in fair value subsequent to the purchase of such securities. We may from time to time, but are under no obligation to, provide additional support to funds managed within Columbia . Future support, if any, may take the form of additional capital commitments to the funds or the purchase of assets from the funds. We are not the primary beneficiary of the cash funds and do not consolidate the cash funds managed within Columbia because the subordinated support provided by the Corporation will not absorb a majority of the variability created by the assets of the funds. The cash funds had total AUM of approximately $189 billion at December 31, 2007. Premier Banking and Investments PB&I includes Banc of America Investments , our full-service retail brokerage business and our Premier Banking channel. PB&I brings personalized banking and investment expertise through priority service with client-dedicated teams. PB&I provides a high-touch client experience through a network of approximately 5,600 client facing associates to our affluent customers with a personal wealth profile that includes investable assets plus a mortgage that exceeds $500,000 or at least $100,000 of investable assets. PB&I includes the impact of migrating qualifying affluent customers, including their related deposit balances, from GCSBB to our PB&I model. After migration, the associated net interest income, service charges and noninterest expense is recorded in PB&I . The growth reported in the financial results of PB&I includes both the impact of migration, as well as the impact of incremental organic growth from providing a broader array of financial products and services to PB&I customers. For 2007 and 2006, a total of $11.4 billion and $10.7 billion of deposits were migrated from GCSBB to PB&I . Net income increased $89 million, or eight percent, to $1.3 billion compared to the same period in 2006 due to an increase in total revenues. Net interest income increased $103 million, or four percent, to $2.7 billion driven by higher average deposit and loan balances partially offset by a shift of the product mix in the deposit portfolio and spread compression. Noninterest income increased $193 million, or 21 percent, to $1.1 billion driven by higher investment and brokerage services income. Noninterest expense increased $140 million, or nine percent, to $1.7 billion primarily due to increases in personnel-related expense driven by the expansion of client facing associates and higher incentives. The growth in PB&I revenues was nine percent, of which approximately seven percent was attributable to the impact of migration and two percent reflected incremental organic growth. ALM/Other ALM/Other primarily includes the results of ALM activities. Net income decreased $99 million, or 39 percent, to $157 million compared to 2006. The decrease was driven by a $103 million decrease in net interest income due to a reduction in the contribution from ALM activities and an increase in noninterest expense of $87 million.

All Other results include a corresponding securitization offset which removes the impact of these securitized loans in order to present the consolidated results on a GAAP basis (i.e., held basis). See the GCSBB section beginning on page 21 for information on the GCSBB managed results. The following All Other discussion focuses on the results on an as adjusted basis excluding the securitization offset. For additional information, see Note 22 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the securitization offset discussed above, All Other includes our Equity Investments businesses and Other . Equity Investments includes Principal Investing, Corporate Investments and Strategic Investments. Principal Investing is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately-held and publicly-traded companies at all stages of their life cycle from start-up to buyout. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund and are accounted for at fair value. In addition, Principal Investing has unfunded equity commitments related to some of these investments. For more information on these commitments, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Investments primarily includes investments in publicly-traded equity securities and funds which are accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities. Strategic Investments includes investments of $16.4 billion in CCB, $2.6 billion in Grupo Financiero Santander, S.A. (Santander), $2.6 billion Banco Ita and other investments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, the shares of CCB are accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities and carried at fair value with a corresponding net-of-tax offset to accumulated OCI. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, these shares were accounted for at cost as they are non-transferable until October 2008. We also hold an option to increase our ownership interest in CCB to 19.1 percent. Additional shares received upon exercise of this option are restricted through August 2011. This option expires in February 2011. The strike price of the option is based on the IPO price that steps up on an annual basis and is currently at 103 percent of the IPO price. The strike price of the option is capped at 118 percent of the IPO price depending when the option is exercised. Our investment in Santander is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The restricted shares of Banco Ita are currently carried at cost but, similar to CCB, will be accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities and carried at fair value with an offset net-of-tax to accumulated OCI beginning in the second quarter of 2008. Income associated with Equity Investments is recorded in equity investment income. Other includes the residual impact of the allowance for credit losses and the cost allocation processes, merger and restructuring charges, intersegment eliminations, and the results of certain businesses that are expected to be or have been sold or are in the process of being liquidated. Other also includes certain amounts associated with ALM activities, including the residual impact of funds transfer pricing allocation methodologies, amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations that do not qualify for SFAS 133 hedge accounting treatment, foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to SFAS 52 revaluation of foreign denominated debt issuances, certain gains (losses) on sales of whole mortgage loans, and gains (losses) on sales of debt securities. Other also includes adjustments to noninterest income and income tax expense to remove the FTE impact of items (primarily low-income housing tax credits) that have been grossed up within noninterest income to a FTE amount in the business segments. Net income increased $1.4 billion to $2.9 billion primarily due to an increase in noninterest income combined with decreases in all other noninterest expense, merger and restructuring charges and provision for credit losses partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income decreased $1.3 billion resulting largely from the absence of net interest income due to the sale of the Latin American operations and Hong Kong-based retail and commercial banking business which were included in our 2006 results. Net interest income was also adversely impacted by the implementation of new accounting guidance (FSP 13-2) which decreased net interest income by approximately $230 million. Noninterest income increased $1.6 billion driven by the $1.5 billion gain from the sale of Marsico. In addition, noninterest income increased 34 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents due to higher equity investment income and the absence of a loss of $496 million on the sale of mortgage-backed debt securities which occurred in the prior year. Partially offsetting these items was a $720 million gain on the sale of our Brazilian operations in 2006 and losses in 2007 of $394 million on securities after they were purchased at fair value from certain cash funds managed within GWIM . In addition, all noninterest income line items were impacted by the absence of noninterest income due to the sale of the Latin American operations and Hong Kong-based retail and commercial banking business which were included in our 2006 results. The following table presents the components of All Other equity investment income and a reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for 2007 and 2006. Components of Equity Investment Income (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Principal Investing $ 2,217 $ 1,894 Corporate and Strategic Investments 1,528 978 Total equity investment income included in All Other 3,745 2,872 Total equity investment income included in the business segments 319 317 Total consolidated equity investment income $ 4,064 $ 3,189 Equity investment income increased $873 million primarily due to the $600 million gain on the sale of private equity funds to Conversus Capital and an increase of $533 million in dividends from CCB, including a special dividend of $184 million prior to CCB 2007 share listing. Partially offsetting these increases was a $341 million gain in 2006 recorded on the liquidation of a strategic European investment. Provision for credit losses decreased $119 million to negative $251 million compared to negative $132 million in 2006, mainly due to reserve reductions from the sale of our Argentina portfolio during the first quarter of 2007 and improved performance of the remaining portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we have previously exited. Merger and restructuring charges decreased $395 million to $410 million compared to $805 million for 2006 due to declining integration costs associated with the MBNA acquisition offset by costs associated with the integration of U.S. Trust Corporation and LaSalle. For additional information on merger and restructuring charges, see Note 2 Merger and Restructuring Activity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in all other noninterest expense of $992 million was largely driven by the absence of operating costs after the sale of the Latin America operations and Hong Kong-based retail and commercial banking business which were included in our 2006 results. Off- and On-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the ordinary course of business, we support our customers financing needs by facilitating their access to the commercial paper market. In addition, we utilize certain financing arrangements to meet our balance sheet management, funding and liquidity needs. For additional information on our liquidity risk, see Liquidity Risk and Capital Management beginning on page 41. These activities utilize SPEs, typically in the form of corporations, limited liability companies, or trusts, which raise funds by issuing short-term commercial paper or similar instruments to third party investors. These SPEs typically hold various types of financial assets whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the SPEs. Investors have recourse to the assets in the SPE and often benefit from other credit enhancements, such as overcollateralization in the form of excess assets in the SPE, liquidity facilities, and other arrangements. As a result, the SPEs can typically obtain a favorable credit rating from the rating agencies, resulting in lower financing costs for our customers.

(2) We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary that will absorb the majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns of the VIEs or both. (3) For additional information on our CDO exposures and related writedowns at December 31, 2007, see the CDO discussion beginning on page 28. We have liquidity agreements, SBLCs or other arrangements with the SPEs, as described below, under which we are obligated to provide funding in the event of a market disruption or other specified event or otherwise provide credit support to the entities (hereinafter referred to as liquidity exposure). We manage our credit risk and any market risk on these arrangements by subjecting them to our normal underwriting and risk management processes. Our credit ratings and changes thereto will affect the borrowing cost and liquidity of these SPEs. In addition, significant changes in counterparty asset valuation and credit standing may also affect the ability of the SPEs to issue commercial paper. The contractual or notional amount of these commitments as presented in Table 8, represents our maximum possible funding obligation and is not, in management view, representative of expected losses or funding requirements. From time to time, we may purchase commercial paper issued by these SPEs in connection with market-making activities or for investment purposes. During the second half of 2007, there were instances in which the asset-backed commercial paper market became illiquid due to market perceptions of uncertainty and certain investment activities were affected. As a result, at December 31, 2007, we held $6.6 billion of commercial paper on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet that was issued in connection with our liquidity obligations to unconsolidated CDOs summarized in the table above. At December 31, 2006, we held $123 million of commercial paper issued by the SPEs included in the table above. The table above presents our liquidity exposure to these consolidated and unconsolidated SPEs, which include VIEs and QSPEs. VIEs are SPEs which lack sufficient equity at risk or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest. QSPEs are SPEs whose activities are strictly limited to holding and servicing financial assets. Some, but not all, of the liquidity commitments to VIEs are considered to be significant variable interests and are disclosed in Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Those liquidity commitments that are not significant variable interests are not required to be included in Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2007 the Corporation total liquidity exposure to SPEs was $104.1 billion, an increase of $35.5 billion from December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to increases in corporation-sponsored multi-seller conduits and municipal bond trusts and corporate SPEs. The increase of $23.0 billion in corporation-sponsored multi-seller conduits was primarily due to organic growth in the business. The increase of $9.8 billion in municipal bond trusts and corporate SPEs was mainly due to the acquisition of LaSalle. Corporation-Sponsored Multi-Seller Conduits We administer three multi-seller conduits which provide a low-cost funding alternative to our customers by facilitating their access to the commercial paper market. Our customers sell or otherwise transfer assets to the conduits, which in turn issue high-grade, short-term commercial paper that is collateralized by the underlying assets. We receive fees for providing combinations of liquidity and SBLCs or similar loss protection commitments to the conduits. These commitments represent significant variable interests in the SPEs, which are discussed in more detail in Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Third parties participate in a small number of the liquidity facilities on a pari passu basis with the Corporation. At December 31, 2007, our liquidity commitments to the conduits were collateralized by various classes of assets. Assets held in the conduits incorporate features such as overcollateralization and cash reserves which are designed to provide credit support at a level that is equivalent to an investment grade as determined in accordance with internal risk rating guidelines. During 2007, there were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets. We are the primary beneficiary of one conduit which is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2007, our liquidity commitments to this conduit were collateralized by credit card loans (21 percent), auto loans (14 percent), equipment loans (13 percent), and student loans (eight percent). None of these assets are subprime residential mortgages. In addition, 29 percent of our commitments were 36 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents collateralized by projected cash flows from long-term contracts (e.g., television broadcast contracts, stadium revenues and royalty payments) which, as mentioned above, incorporate features that provide credit support at a level equivalent to an investment grade. At December 31, 2007, the weighted average life of assets in the consolidated conduit was 5.4 years and the weighted average maturity of commercial paper issued by this conduit was 40 days. Assets of the Corporation are not available to pay creditors of the consolidated conduit except to the extent the Corporation may be obligated to perform under the liquidity commitments and SBLCs. Assets of the consolidated conduit are not available to pay creditors of the Corporation. We do not consolidate the other two conduits as we do not expect to absorb a majority of the variability of the conduits. At December 31, 2007, our liquidity commitments to the unconsolidated conduits were collateralized by student loans (27 percent), credit card loans and trade receivables (10 percent each), and auto loans (eight percent). Less than one percent of these assets are subprime residential mortgages. In addition, 29 percent of our commitments were collateralized by the conduits short-term lending arrangements with investment funds, primarily real estate funds, which as mentioned above, incorporate features that provide credit support at a level equivalent to an investment grade. Amounts advanced under these arrangements will be repaid when the investment funds issue capital calls to their qualified equity investors. At December 31, 2007, the weighted average life of assets in the unconsolidated conduits was 2.6 years and the weighted average maturity of commercial paper issued by these conduits was 36 days. The liquidity commitments and SBLCs provided to unconsolidated conduits are included in Table 10 in the Obligations and Commitments section beginning on page 38. We have no other contractual obligations to the unconsolidated conduits, nor do we intend to provide noncontractual or other forms of support. On a combined basis, the unconsolidated conduits issued approximately $27 million of capital notes and equity interests to third parties. This represents the maximum amount of loss that would be absorbed by the third party investors. Based on an analysis of projected cash flows, we have determined that the Corporation will not absorb a majority of the variability created by the assets of the conduits. Despite the market disruptions in the second half of 2007, the conduits did not experience any material difficulties in issuing commercial paper. The Corporation did not purchase any commercial paper issued by the conduits other than incidentally and in its role as commercial paper dealer. Municipal Bond Trusts and Corporate SPEs We have provided a total of $17.7 billion and $7.9 billion in liquidity support to municipal bond trusts and corporate SPEs at December 31, 2007 and 2006. We administer municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds, some of which are callable prior to maturity, for which we provided liquidity support of $13.4 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006. In addition, we administer several conduits to which we provided $4.3 billion and $5.3 billion of liquidity support at December 31, 2007 and 2006. As it relates to the municipal bond trusts the weighted average remaining life of the bonds at December 31, 2007 was 20.8 years. Substantially all of the bonds are rated AAA or AA and some of the bonds benefit from being wrapped by monolines. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2007. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly basis to third party investors. The floating-rate investors have the right to tender the certificates at any time upon seven days notice. We serve as remarketing agent and liquidity provider for the trusts. Should we be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, we are generally obligated to purchase them at par. We are not obligated to purchase the certificate if a bond credit rating declines below investment grade or in the event of certain defaults or bankruptcy of the issuer and/or insurer. The total notional amount of floating-rate certificates for which we provide liquidity support was $13.4 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Some of these trusts are QSPEs. We consolidate those trusts that are not QSPEs if we hold the residual interest or otherwise expect to absorb a majority of the variability of the trusts. We have $6.1 billion of liquidity commitments to unconsolidated trusts at December 31, 2007, which are included in Table 10 in the Obligations and Commitments section beginning on page 38. Assets of the other corporate conduits consisted primarily of high-grade, long-term municipal, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities which had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 7.5 years at December 31, 2007. Substantially all of the securities are rated AAA or AA and some of the bonds benefit from being wrapped by monolines. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or insurers during 2007. These conduits, which are QSPEs, obtain funding by issuing commercial paper to third party investors. At December 31, 2007, the weighted average maturity of the commercial paper was 25 days. We have entered into derivative contracts which provide interest rate, currency and a pre-specified amount of credit protection to the entities in exchange for the commercial paper rate. In addition, we may be obligated to purchase assets from the vehicles if the assets or insurers are downgraded. If an asset rating declines below a certain investment quality as evidenced by its credit rating or defaults, we are no longer exposed to the risk of loss. Due to the market disruptions during the second half of 2007, these conduits began to experience difficulties in issuing commercial paper as credit spreads widened. On occasion, including in the first quarter of 2008, we held some of the issued commercial paper when marketing attempts were unsuccessful. In the event that we are unable to remarket the conduits commercial paper such that it no longer qualifies as a QSPE, we would consolidate the conduit which may have an adverse impact on the fair value of the related derivative contracts. At December 31, 2007 we did not hold any commercial paper issued by the conduits. We have no other contractual obligations to the unconsolidated bond trusts and conduits described above, nor do we intend to provide noncontractual or other forms of support. Derivative activity related to these entities is included in Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on QSPEs, see Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on our monoline exposure, see Industry Concentrations beginning on page 54. Collateralized Debt Obligation Vehicles CDOs are SPEs that hold diversified pools of fixed income securities. They issue multiple tranches of debt securities, including commercial paper and equity securities. We receive fees for structuring the CDOs and/or placing debt securities with third party investors. We provided total liquidity support of $12.3 billion and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006 consisting of $10.0 billion and $2.1 billion of written put options and $2.3 billion and $5.5 billion of other forms of liquidity support. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we provided liquidity support in the form of written put options on $10.0 billion and $2.1 billion of commercial paper issued by CDOs, including $3.2 billion issued by a consolidated CDO at December 31, 2007. No third parties provide similar Bank of America 2007 37 Table of Contents commitments to these CDOs. The commercial paper is the most senior class of securities issued by the CDOs and benefits from the subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated securities. The amount that is principally backed by subprime residential mortgage exposure (net of insurance and prior to writedowns) totaled $7.4 billion. This amount included approximately $2.8 billion of high grade ABS, $4.2 billion of CDOs-squared, of which $3.2 billion were consolidated, and $363 million of mezzanine ABS. The commercial paper subject to the put options is the most senior class of securities issued by the CDOs and benefits from the subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated securities. We are obligated under the written put options to provide funding to the CDOs by purchasing the commercial paper at predetermined contractual yields in the event of a severe disruption in the short-term funding market as evidenced by the inability of the CDOs to issue commercial paper at spreads below a predetermined rate. Prior to the second half of 2007, we believed that the likelihood of our experiencing an economic loss as the result of our obligations under the written put options was remote. However, due to severe market disruptions during the second half of 2007, the CDOs holding the put options began to experience difficulties in issuing commercial paper. Shortly thereafter, a significant portion of the assets held in these CDOs were downgraded or threatened with downgrade by the rating agencies. As a result of these factors, we began to purchase commercial paper that could not be issued to third parties at less than the contractual yield specified in our liquidity obligations. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the written put options. These written put options are recorded as derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in trading account profits (losses). Derivative activity related to these entities is included in Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also administer a CDO conduit that obtains funds by issuing commercial paper to third party investors. The conduit held $2.3 billion and $5.5 billion of assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 consisting of super senior tranches of debt securities issued by other CDOs, none of which are principally backed by subprime residential mortgages at December 31, 2007. We provide liquidity support equal to the amount of assets in this conduit which obligates us to purchase the commercial paper at a predetermined contractual yield in the event of a severe disruption in the short-term funding market as evidenced by the inability of the conduit to issue commercial paper at spreads below a predetermined rate. In addition, we are obligated to purchase assets from the conduit or absorb market losses on the sale of assets in the event of a downgrade or decline in credit quality of the assets. Our $2.3 billion liquidity commitment to the conduit at December 31, 2007 is included in Table 10 in the Obligations and Commitments section. We are the sole provider of liquidity to the CDO vehicle. During the fourth quarter of 2007, as contractually allowed in our role as conduit administrator, the Corporation removed certain assets from the CDO conduit due to a decline in credit quality. The CDO conduit also began to experience difficulties in issuing commercial paper due to market disruptions during the second half of 2007, and we began to purchase commercial paper that could not be issued to third parties at less than the contractual yield specified in our liquidity obligations. At December 31, 2007, we held $6.6 billion of commercial paper on the balance sheet that was issued by unconsolidated CDO vehicles of which $5.0 billion related to the written put options and $1.6 billion related to other liquidity support. We also held AFS debt securities in consolidated CDO vehicles with a fair value of $2.8 billion that were principally related to certain assets that were removed from the CDO conduit, as discussed above. We recorded losses of $3.2 billion, net of insurance, in trading account profits (losses) in 2007 of which $2.7 billion related to written put options and $519 million related to other liquidity support. These losses are included in the $4.0 billion of net writedowns on super senior CDO exposure which is discussed in more detail beginning on page 28. Asset Acquisition Conduits We administer two unconsolidated conduits which acquire assets on behalf of our customers. The return on the assets held in the conduits, which consist principally of liquid exchange-traded securities and some leveraged loans, is passed through to our customers through a series of derivative contracts. We consolidate a third conduit which holds subordinated debt securities for our benefit. These conduits obtain funding through the issuance of commercial paper and subordinated certificates to third party investors. Repayment of the commercial paper and certificates is assured by derivative contracts between the Corporation and the conduits, and we are reimbursed through the derivative contracts with our customers. Our performance under the derivatives is collateralized by the underlying assets. Derivative activity related to these entities is included in Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Despite the market disruptions in the second half of 2007, the conduits did not experience any material difficulties in issuing commercial paper. The Corporation did not hold a significant amount of commercial paper issued by the conduits at any time during 2007. At December 31, 2007, the weighted average life of commercial paper issued by the conduits was 34 days. We have no other contractual obligations to the conduits described above, nor do we intend to provide noncontractual or other forms of support. Customer-Sponsored Conduits We provide liquidity facilities to conduits that are sponsored by our customers and which provide them with direct access to the commercial paper market. We are typically one of several liquidity providers for a customer conduit. We do not provide SBLCs or other forms of credit enhancement to these conduits. Assets of these conduits consist primarily of auto loans, student loans and credit card receivables. The liquidity commitments benefit from structural protections which vary depending upon the program, but given these protections, the exposures are viewed to be of investment grade quality. These commitments are included in Table 10 in the Obligations and Commitments section. As we typically provide less than 20 percent of the total liquidity commitments to these conduits and do not provide other forms of support, we have concluded that we do not hold a significant variable interest in the conduits and they are not included in our discussion of VIEs in Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Obligations and Commitments We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. 38 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Included in purchase obligations are vendor contracts of $4.9 billion, commitments to purchase securities of $3.7 billion and commitments to purchase loans of $27.1 billion. The most significant of our vendor contracts include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plans, Nonqualified Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans assets and any participant contributions, if applicable. During 2007 and 2006, we contributed $243 million and $2.6 billion to the Plans, and we expect to make at least $206 million of con- tributions during 2008. The following table does not include UTBs of $3.1 billion associated with FIN 48 and tax-related interest and penalties of $573 million. Debt, lease, equity and other obligations are more fully discussed in Note 12 Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Plans and UTBs are more fully discussed in Note 16 Employee Benefit Plans and Note 18 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 9 presents total long-term debt and other obligations at December 31, 2007.

Many of our lending relationships contain funded and unfunded elements. The funded portion is reflected on our balance sheet. For lending relationships carried at historical cost, the unfunded component of these commitments is not recorded on our balance sheet until a draw is made under the credit facility; however, a reserve is established for probable losses. For lending commitments for which we have elected to account for under SFAS 159, the fair value of the commitment is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The Corporation also manages certain concentrations of commitments (e.g., bridge financing) through its established originate to distribute strategy. For more information on these commitments and guarantees, including equity commitments, see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the adoption of SFAS 159, see Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. The table below summarizes the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date. At December 31, 2007, the unfunded lending commitments related to charge cards (nonrevolving card lines) to individuals and government entities guaranteed by the U.S. Government in the amount of $9.9 billion (related outstandings of $193 million) were not included in credit card line commitments in the table below. Other Commitments We provided support to cash funds managed within GWIM by purchasing certain assets at fair value and by committing to provide a limited amount of capital to the funds.

Bank of America 2007 39 Table of Contents Managing Risk Overview Our management governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of our business through an integrated planning and review process that includes strategic, financial, associate, customer and risk planning. We derive much of our revenue from managing risk from customer transactions for profit. In addition to qualitative factors, we utilize quantitative measures to optimize risk and reward trade offs in order to achieve growth targets and financial objectives while reducing the variability of earnings and minimizing unexpected losses. Risk metrics that allow us to measure performance include economic capital targets and corporate risk limits. By allocating economic capital to a line of business, we effectively manage that business ability to take on risk. Review and approval of business plans incorporate approval of economic capital allocation, and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting. Industry, country, trading, asset allocation and other limits supplement the allocation of economic capital. These limits are based on an analysis of risk and reward in each line of business and management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. Our risk management process continually evaluates risk and appropriate metrics needed to measure it. Our business exposes us to the following major risks: strategic, liquidity, credit, market and operational risk. Strategic risk is the risk that adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, execution and/or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives. Liquidity risk is the inability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty inability to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions, such as interest rate movements. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or external events. The following sections, Strategic Risk Management on page 41, Liquidity Risk and Capital Management beginning on page 41, Credit Risk Management beginning on page 44, Market Risk Management beginning on page 61 and Operational Risk Management beginning on page 68, address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage. Risk Management Processes and Methods We have established and continually enhance control processes and use various methods to align risk-taking and risk management throughout our organization. These control processes and methods are designed around three lines of defense : lines of business, enterprise functions and Corporate Audit. The lines of business are the first line of defense and are responsible for identifying, quantifying, mitigating and monitoring all risks within their lines of business, while certain enterprise-wide risks are managed centrally. For example, except for trading-related business activities, interest rate risk associated with our business activities is managed centrally as part of our ALM activities. Line of business management makes and executes the business plan and is closest to the changing nature of risks and, therefore, we believe is best able to take actions to manage and mitigate those risks. Our lines of business prepare periodic self-assessment reports to identify the status of risk issues, including mitigation plans, if appropriate. These reports roll up to executive management to ensure appropriate risk management and oversight, and to identify enterprise-wide issues. Our management processes, structures and policies aid us in complying with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision-making and accountability. Wherever practical, we attempt to house decision-making authority as close to the transaction as possible while retaining supervisory control functions from both in and outside of the lines of business. The key elements of the second line of defense are Risk Management, Compliance, Finance, Global Technology and Operations, Human Resources, and Legal functions. These groups are independent of the lines of businesses and are organized on both a line of business and enterprise-wide basis. For example, for Risk Management, a senior risk executive is assigned to each of the lines of business and is responsible for the oversight of all the risks associated with that line of business. Enterprise-level risk executives have responsibility to develop and implement polices and practices to assess and manage enterprise-wide credit, market and operational risks. Corporate Audit, the third line of defense, provides an independent assessment of our management and internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and operating information is materially complete, accurate and reliable; and employees actions are in compliance with corporate policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations. We use various methods to manage risks at the line of business levels and corporate-wide. Examples of these methods include planning and forecasting, risk committees and forums, limits, models, and hedging strategies. Planning and forecasting facilitates analysis of actual versus planned results and provides an indication of unanticipated risk levels. Generally, risk committees and forums are composed of lines of business, risk management, treasury, compliance, legal and finance personnel, among others, who actively monitor performance against plan, limits, potential issues, and introduction of new products. Limits, the amount of exposure that may be taken in a product, relationship, region or industry, seek to align corporate-wide risk goals with those of each line of business and are part of our overall risk management process to help reduce the volatility of market, credit and operational losses. Models are used to estimate market value and net interest income sensitivity, and to estimate expected and unexpected losses for each product and line of business, where appropriate. Hedging strategies are used to manage the risk of borrower or counterparty concentration risk and to manage market risk in the portfolio. The formal processes used to manage risk represent only one portion of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our associates are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Ethics, we set a high standard for our associates. The Code of Ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of our products or services to our customers. We instill a risk-conscious culture through communications, training, policies, procedures, and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the linkage between the associate performance management process and individual compensation to encourage associates to work toward corporate-wide risk goals. 40 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Oversight The Board oversees the risk management of the Corporation through its committees, management committees and the Chief Executive Officer. The Board Audit Committee monitors (1) the effectiveness of our internal controls, (2) the integrity of our Consolidated Financial Statements and (3) compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees the internal audit function and the independent registered public accountant. The Board Asset Quality Committee oversees credit risks and related topics that may impact our assets and earnings. The Finance Committee, a management committee, oversees the development and performance of the policies and strategies for managing the strategic, credit, market, and operational risks to our earnings and capital. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, oversees our policies and processes designed to assure sound market risk and balance sheet management. The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC) has been designated by ALCO as the primary governance authority for Global Markets Risk Management. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, oversees our policies and processes designed to assure sound operational and compliance risk management. The Credit Risk Committee (CRC), a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, oversees and approves our adherence to sound credit risk management policies and practices. Certain CRC approvals are subject to the oversight of the Board Asset Quality Committee. The Executive Management Team (i.e., Chief Executive Officer and select executives of the management team) reviews our corporate strategies and objectives, evaluates business performance, and reviews business plans including economic capital allocations to the Corporation and lines of business. Management continues to direct corporate-wide efforts to address the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision new risk-based capital standards (Basel II). The Audit Committee and Finance Committee oversee management plans to comply with Basel II. For additional information, see the Basel II discussion on page 43 and Note 15 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is the risk that adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, execution and/or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives. We use an integrated planning process to help manage strategic risk. A key component of the planning process aligns strategies, goals, tactics and resources throughout the enterprise. The process begins with the creation of a corporate-wide business plan which incorporates an assessment of the strategic risks. This business plan establishes the corporate strategic direction. The planning process then cascades through the lines of business, creating business line plans that are aligned with the Corporation strategic direction. At each level, tactics and metrics are identified to measure success in achieving goals and assure adherence to the plans. As part of this process, the lines of business continuously evaluate the impact of changing market and business conditions, and the overall risk in meeting objectives. See the Operational Risk Management section beginning on page 68 for a further description of this process. Corporate Audit in turn monitors, and independently reviews and evaluates, the plans and measurement processes. One of the key tools we use to manage strategic risk is economic capital allocation. Through the economic capital allocation process, we effectively manage each line of business ability to take on risk. Review and approval of business plans incorporate approval of economic capital allocation, and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting. Economic capital allocation plans for the lines of business are incorporated into the Corporation operating plan that is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Liquidity Risk and Capital Management Liquidity Risk Liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth and business operations, and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events. Sources of liquidity include deposits and other customer-based funding, and wholesale market-based funding. We manage liquidity at two levels. The first is the liquidity of the parent company, which is the holding company that owns the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The second is the liquidity of the banking subsidiaries. The management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the parent company and banking subsidiaries have different funding needs and sources, and are subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements. Through ALCO, the Finance Committee is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy as well as approving operating and contingency procedures, and monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis. Corporate Treasury is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategy. In order to ensure adequate liquidity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions, we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility and diversity. Key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on customer-based funding, maintaining direct relationships with wholesale market funding providers, and maintaining the ability to liquefy certain assets when, and if, requirements warrant. We develop and maintain contingency funding plans for both the parent company and bank liquidity positions. These plans evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained. The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period, and define roles and responsibilities. They are reviewed and approved annually by ALCO. Bank of America 2007 41 Table of Contents Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. The credit ratings of Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. are reflected in the table below. Table 11 Credit Ratings December 31, 2007 Bank of America Corporation Bank of America, N.A. Senior Debt Subordinated Debt Commercial Paper Short-term Borrowings Long-term Debt Moody Investors Service Aa1 Aa2 P-1 P-1 Aaa Standard & Poor AA AA- A-1+ A-1+ AA+ Fitch Ratings AA AA- F1+ F1+ AA Under normal business conditions, primary sources of funding for the parent company include dividends received from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of senior and subordinated debt, as well as commercial paper and equity. Primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt and commercial paper, share repurchases, dividends paid to shareholders, and subsidiary funding through capital or debt. The parent company maintains a cushion of excess liquidity that would be sufficient to fully fund the holding company and nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period during which funding from normal sources is disrupted. The primary measure used to assess the parent company liquidity is the Time to Required Funding during such a period of liquidity disruption. This measure assumes that the parent company is unable to generate funds from debt or equity issuance, receives no dividend income from subsidiaries, and no longer pays dividends to shareholders while continuing to meet nondiscretionary uses needed to maintain bank operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent company and affiliated companies. Under this scenario, the amount of time the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered the Time to Required Funding. ALCO approves the target range set for this metric, in months, and monitors adherence to the target. Maintaining excess parent company cash ensures that Time to Required Funding remains in the target range of 21 to 27 months and is the primary driver of the timing and amount of the Corporation debt issuances. As of December 31, 2007 Time to Required Funding was 19 months compared to 24 months at December 31, 2006. The reduction reflects the funding of the LaSalle acquisition for $21.0 billion in cash which closed on October 1, 2007. We had anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2007 that the Time to Required Funding would decrease slightly below our target range as a result of the funding of the LaSalle acquisition. We anticipate returning to our target range in 2008 due in part to the issuance of preferred stock in the first quarter of 2008. For additional information on our recent preferred stock issuances, see the Preferred Stock discussion on page 44. The primary sources of funding for our banking subsidiaries include customer deposits and wholesale market based funding. Primary uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include growth in the core asset portfolios, including loan demand, and in the ALM portfolio. We use the ALM portfolio primarily to manage interest rate risk and liquidity risk. One ratio that can be used to monitor the stability of funding composition is the loan to domestic deposit ratio. This ratio reflects the percent of loans and leases that are funded by domestic core deposits, a relatively stable funding source. A ratio below 100 percent indicates that our loan portfolio is completely funded by domestic core deposits. The ratio was 127 percent at December 31, 2007 compared to 118 percent at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio, and a decision to retain a larger share of mortgage production on the Corporation balance sheet. The strength of our balance sheet is a result of rigorous financial and risk discipline. Our core deposit base, which is a low cost funding source, is often used to fund the purchase of incremental assets (primarily loans and securities), the composition of which impacts our loan to deposit ratio. Mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans have prepayment risk which must be managed. Repricing of deposits is a key variable in this process. The capital generated in excess of capital adequacy targets and to support business growth, is available for the payment of dividends and share repurchases. ALCO determines prudent parameters for wholesale market-based borrowing and regularly reviews the funding plan for the bank subsidiaries to ensure compliance with these parameters. The contingency funding plan for the banking subsidiaries evaluates liquidity over a 12-month period in a variety of business environment scenarios assuming different levels of earnings performance and credit ratings as well as public and investor relations factors. Funding exposure related to our role as liquidity provider to certain off-balance sheet financing entities is also measured under a stress scenario. In this analysis, ratings are downgraded such that the off-balance sheet financing entities are not able to issue commercial paper and backup facilities that we provide are drawn upon. In addition, potential draws on credit facilities to issuers with ratings below a certain level are analyzed to assess potential funding exposure. We originate loans for retention on our balance sheet and for distribution. As part of our originate to distribute strategy, commercial loan originations are distributed through syndication structures, and residential mortgages originated by Consumer Real Estate are frequently distributed in the secondary market. In connection with our balance sheet management activities, we may retain mortgage loans originated as well as purchase and sell loans based on our assessment of market conditions. Regulatory Capital At December 31, 2007, the Corporation operated its banking activities primarily under three charters: Bank of America, N.A., FIA Card Services, N.A. and LaSalle Bank, N.A. As a regulated financial services company, we are governed by certain regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Corporation, Bank of America, N.A., and FIA Card Services, N.A., were classified as well-capitalized for regulatory purposes, the highest classification. At December 31, 2007, LaSalle Bank, N.A. was also classified as well-capitalized for regulatory purposes. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2007 that management believes have changed the Corporation s, Bank of America, N.A. s, FIA Card Services, N.A. s, and LaSalle Bank, N.A. capital classifications. 42 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Table 12 Reconciliation of Tier 1 and Total Capital December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Tier 1 Capital Total shareholders equity $ 146,803 $ 135,272 Goodwill (77,530 ) (65,662 ) Nonqualifying intangible assets (1) (5,239 ) (3,782 ) Effect of net unrealized (gains) losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities and net (gains) losses on derivatives recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax (2,149 ) 6,565 Unamortized net periodic benefit costs recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax 1,301 1,428 Trust securities (2) 16,863 15,942 Other 3,323 1,301 Total Tier 1 Capital 83,372 91,064 Long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 Capital 31,771 24,546 Allowance for loan and lease losses 11,588 9,016 Reserve for unfunded lending commitments 518 397 Other (3) 6,471 203 Total Capital $ 133,720 $ 125,226 (1) Nonqualifying intangible assets of the Corporation are comprised of certain core deposit intangibles, affinity relationships and other intangibles. (2) Trust securities are net of unamortized discounts. (3) Includes 45 percent, or $6.0 billion, of the pre-tax fair value adjustment related to the Corporation stock investment in CCB. Certain corporate sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are deconsolidated under FIN 46R. As a result, the Trust Securities are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On March 1, 2005, the FRB issued Risk-Based Capital Standards: Trust Preferred Securities and the Definition of Capital (the Final Rule) which allows Trust Securities to continue to qualify as Tier 1 Capital with revised quantitative limits that would be effective after a five-year transition period. As a result, we continue to include Trust Securities in Tier 1 Capital. The Final Rule limits restricted core capital elements to 15 percent for internationally active bank holding companies. In addition, the FRB revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. Internationally active bank holding companies are those with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or on-balance sheet exposure greater than $10 billion. At December 31, 2007, our restricted core capital elements comprised 20.3 percent of total core capital elements. We expect to be fully compliant with the revised limits prior to the implementation date of March 31, 2009. Table 12 reconciles the Corporation total shareholders equity to Tier 1 and Total Capital as defined by the regulations issued by the FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios were 6.87 percent, 11.02 percent, and 5.04 percent, respectively. During 2007, the Corporation completed its acquisitions of U.S. Trust Corporation for $3.3 billion in cash and LaSalle for $21.0 billion in cash. As a result of these acquisitions, the Corporation Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage ratios were reduced by approximately 130 bps, 145 bps and 90 bps, respectively, at December 31, 2007. In January 2008, we issued 240 thousand shares of Bank of America Corporation Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series K with a par value of $0.01 per share for $6.0 billion. The fixed rate is 8.00 percent through January 29, 2018 and then adjusts to three-month LIBOR plus 363 bps thereafter. In addition, we issued 6.9 million shares of Bank of America Corporation 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L with a par value of $0.01 per share for $6.9 billion. Based on December 31, 2007 balances, the Corporation Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios are expected to increase by approximately 105 bps and its Tier 1 Leverage ratio is expected to increase by approximately 75 bps as a result of these issuances. See Note 15 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Corporation regulatory capital. Basel II In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks. Similar to economic capital measures, Basel II seeks to address credit risk, market risk and operational risk. While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the Corporation also maintains a certain threshold in terms of regulatory capital to adhere to legal standards of capital adequacy. These thresholds or leverage ratios will continue to be utilized for the foreseeable future. On December 7, 2007, the U.S. regulatory agencies published the final Basel II rules (Basel II Rules). The Basel II Rules establish requirements for the U.S. implementation and provide detailed capital requirements for credit and operational risk under Pillar 1, supervisory requirements under Pillar 2 and disclosure requirements under Pillar 3. We are still awaiting final rules for market risk requirements under Basel II. The Basel II Rules allow U.S. financial institutions to begin parallel reporting as early as 2008. During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations under both the current (Basel I) rules and the Basel II Rules should be reported to the financial institutions regulatory supervisors for examination and compliance for at least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel period and subsequent three-year transition period are successfully completed, the financial institution will utilize Basel II as their means of capital adequacy assessment, measurement and reporting and discontinue use of Basel I. We continue execution efforts to ensure preparedness with all Basel II requirements. The goal is to achieve full compliance by the end of the three-year implementation period in 2011. Further, internationally Basel II was implemented in several countries during the second half of 2007, while others will begin implementation in 2008 and 2009. Bank of America 2007 43 Table of Contents Dividends In 2007, the Corporation paid cash dividends of $10.7 billion on its common stock. Effective for the third quarter 2007 dividend, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend 14 percent from $0.56 to $0.64 per share. In October 2007, the Board declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.64 which was paid on December 28, 2007 to common shareholders of record on December 7, 2007. In January 2008, the Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.64 per common share payable on March 28, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 7, 2008. In 2007, the Corporation paid a total of $182 million in cash dividends on its various series of preferred stock. In January 2008, we also declared five dividends in regards to preferred stock. The first was a $1.75 regular quarterly cash dividend on the 7 percent Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series B, payable April 25, 2008 to shareholders of record on April 11, 2008. The second was a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.38775 per depositary share on the 6.204% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D, payable March 14, 2008 to shareholders of record on February 29, 2008. The third was a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.33342 per depositary share on the Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E, payable on February 15, 2008 to shareholders of record on January 31, 2008. The fourth was a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.41406 per depositary share on the 6.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I, payable April 1, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2008. The fifth was the initial cash dividend of $0.35750 per depositary share on the 7.25% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J, payable on February 1, 2008 to shareholders of record on January 15, 2008. Common Share Repurchases We expect to continue to repurchase shares, from time to time, in the open market or in private transactions through our approved repurchase programs. We repurchased approximately 73.7 million shares of common stock in 2007 which more than offset the 53.5 million shares issued under employee stock plans. In January 2007, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 200 million shares of the Corporation common stock at an aggregate cost not to exceed $14.0 billion to be completed within a period of 12 to 18 months of which the lesser of approximately $13.5 billion, or 189.4 million shares, remains available for repurchase under the program at December 31, 2007. Preferred Stock In January 2008, we issued 240 thousand shares of Bank of America Corporation Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series K with a par value of $0.01 per share for $6.0 billion. The fixed rate is 8.00 percent through January 29, 2018 and then adjusts to three-month LIBOR plus 363 bps thereafter. In addition, we issued 6.9 million shares of Bank of America Corporation 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L with a par value of $0.01 per share for $6.9 billion. In November and December 2007, the Corporation issued 41 thousand shares of Bank of America Corporation 7.25% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J, with a par value of $0.01 per share for $1.0 billion. In September 2007, the Corporation issued 22 thousand shares of Bank of America Corporation 6.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I, with a par value of $0.01 per share for $550 million. For additional information on the issuance and redemption of preferred stock, see Note 14 Shareholders Equity and Earnings per Common Share to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, derivatives, trading account assets, assets held-for-sale, deposit overdrafts and unfunded lending commitments that include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale are recorded at fair value, or the lower of cost or fair value. Loans and unfunded commitments, which the Corporation elected to account for at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159, are also recorded at fair value. Credit risk for these categories of assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustment recorded in earnings in the period incurred. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current mark-to-market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded credit exposures. For additional information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 4 Derivatives and Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For credit risk purposes, we evaluate our consumer businesses on both a held and managed basis. Managed basis assumes that loans that have been securitized were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. We evaluate credit performance on a managed basis as the receivables that have been securitized are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans. In addition to the discussion of credit quality statistics of both held and managed loans included in this section, refer to the Card Services discussion beginning on page 22. For additional information on our managed portfolio and securitizations, see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below. The financial market conditions that existed in the second half of 2007 have continued to affect the economy and the financial services sector in 2008. It remains unclear what impact the housing downturn, declines in real estate values and the overall economic slowdown will ultimately have and how long these conditions will exist. We expect that certain industry sectors, in particular those that are dependent on the housing sector, and certain geographic regions, will experience further stress. Continued deterioration of the housing market, including recessionary conditions, will negatively impact the credit quality of our consumer portfolio as well as the credit quality of the consumer dependent sectors of our commercial portfolio and will result in a higher provision for credit losses in future periods. The degree of the impact will be dependent upon the duration and severity of the housing downturn. As part of our credit risk management culture, we continually evaluate our credit standards and adjust them to be consistent with changes in the environment. For exam- 44 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents ple, we have adjusted our underwriting criteria, as well as enhanced our line management and collection strategies across the consumer businesses. In the commercial businesses, we have increased the frequency of portfolio monitoring and are aggressively managing exposure when we begin to see signs of deterioration. Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. In addition, credit decisions are statistically based with tolerances set to decrease the percentage of approvals as the risk profile increases. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a critical component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in the determination of both new and existing credit decisions, portfolio management strategies including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, determination of the allowance for credit losses, and economic capital allocations for credit risk. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and charge-offs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management of Consumer Credit Risk Concentrations Consumer credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that credit concentrations do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage credit exposure in numerous ways such as by product and geography in order to achieve the desired mix. Additionally, to enhance our overall risk management strategy credit protection is purchased on certain portions of our portfolio. Our consumer loan portfolio in the states of California, Florida, New York and Texas represented in aggregate 43 percent and 42 percent of total managed consumer loans at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our consumer loan portfolio in the state of California represented approximately 24 percent and 23 percent of total managed consumer loans at December 31, 2007 and 2006, primarily driven by the consumer real estate portfolio. Our consumer loan portfolio in the state of Florida is our second largest concentration and represented approximately eight percent of total managed consumer loans at both December 31, 2007 and 2006, primarily driven by the consumer real estate portfolio. New York and Texas represented six percent and five percent of total managed consumer loans at both December 31, 2007 and 2006. No state other than California, and no single Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented more than 10 percent of the total managed consumer portfolio. No other single state represented over five percent of total managed consumer loans. We have mitigated a portion of our credit risk in our residential mortgage loan portfolio by using synthetic securitizations. These agreements are cash collateralized and will reimburse us in the event that losses exceed established loss levels. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $140.0 billion and $130.0 billion of mortgage loans were protected by these agreements. In addition, we have entered into credit protection agreements with government-sponsored agencies on approximately $33.0 billion and $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, providing full protection on conforming residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. Our regulatory risk-weighted assets were reduced as a result of these transactions because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, these transactions had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $49.0 billion and $36.4 billion, and resulted in increases of 27 bps and 30 bps in our Tier 1 Capital ratio at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

These loans are charged-off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due. (2) Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases were 0.62 percent and 0.22 percent on a held basis, and 0.52 percent and 0.18 percent on a managed basis at December 31, 2007 and 2006. (3) Accruing consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases were 0.57 percent and 0.58 percent on a held basis, and 0.89 percent and 0.88 percent on a managed basis at December 31, 2007 and 2006. (4) Net charge-off/loss ratios are calculated as held net charge-offs or managed net losses divided by average outstanding held or managed loans and leases during the year for each loan and lease category. (5) Home equity loan balances previously included in direct/indirect consumer and other consumer were reclassified to home equity to conform to current year presentation. Additionally, certain foreign consumer balances were reclassified from other consumer to direct/indirect consumer to conform to current year presentation. (6) Outstandings include foreign consumer loans of $3.4 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006. (7) Outstandings include foreign consumer loans of $829 million and $2.3 billion and consumer finance loans of $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006. n/a = not applicable Consumer Credit Portfolio Table 13 presents our held and managed consumer loans and leases, and related credit quality information for 2007 and 2006. Overall, consumer credit quality indicators deteriorated from the favorable levels experienced in 2006. Weakness in the housing markets resulted in rising credit risk, most notably in home equity. Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 50 percent of held consumer loans and leases and 42 percent of managed consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2007. Approximately 24 percent of the managed residential portfolio is in GCSBB and GWIM and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our customers. The remaining portion of the managed portfolio is mostly in All Other , and is comprised of purchased and originated residential mortgage loans used in our overall ALM activities. Residential mortgage loans to borrowers in the state of California represented 34 percent and 33 percent of total residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California represented 11 percent of the total residential mortgage portfolio at both 2007 and 2006. In addition, residential mortgage loans to borrowers in the state of Florida represented six percent and seven percent of the total residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006. No single MSA within Florida represented more than 10 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2007 and 2006. A portion of our credit risk on 68 percent and 56 percent of our residential mortgage loans in California and Florida was mitigated through the purchase of credit protection. See Management of Consumer Credit Risk Concentrations beginning on page 45 for more information. On a held basis, outstanding loans and leases increased $33.8 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 driven by retained mortgage production and the acquisition of LaSalle. Nonperforming balances increased $1.3 billion due to portfolio seasoning reflective of growth in the business and the impact of the weak housing market. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest of $237 million and $118 million were related to repurchases pursuant to our servicing agreements with Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage pools where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Due to current market conditions, members of the mortgage servicing industry are evaluating a number of programs for identifying subprime residential mortgage loan borrowers who are at risk of default and offering loss mitigation strategies, including repayment plans and loan modifications, to such borrowers. Generally these programs require that the borrower and subprime residential mortgage loan meet certain criteria in order to qualify for a modification. The SEC Office of the Chief Accountant (OCA) noted that if certain loan modification requirements are met, the OCA will not object to continued status of the transferee as a QSPE under SFAS 140. We do not currently originate or service significant subprime residential mortgage loans, nor do we hold a significant amount of beneficial interests in QSPE securitizations of subprime residential mortgage loans. We do not expect that the implementation of these programs will have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 46 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Credit Card Domestic The consumer domestic credit card portfolio is managed in Card Services . Outstandings in the held domestic credit card loan portfolio increased $4.6 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to organic growth in the portfolio partially offset by an increase in securitized levels. The $136 million decrease in held domestic loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest was driven by the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the securitization trust and an increased level of securitizations partially offset by portfolio seasoning. Net charge-offs for the held domestic portfolio decreased $31 million to $3.1 billion, or 5.29 percent of total average held credit card domestic loans compared to 4.85 percent (5.00 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. Net charge-offs decreased primarily due to the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the securitization trust and an increased level of securitizations as well as the absence of 2006 charge-offs related to changes made in credit card minimum payment requirements. These decreases were partially offset by portfolio seasoning and increases from the unusually low charge-off levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform. Managed domestic credit card outstandings increased $9.3 billion to $151.9 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to an increase in retail and cash volumes and lower payment rates. Managed net losses increased $1.6 billion to $7.0 billion, or 4.91 percent of total average managed domestic loans compared to 3.89 percent (3.96 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. The increases were primarily due to portfolio seasoning and increases from the unusually low loss levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform. See page 48 for a discussion of the impact of SOP 03-3 on managed losses and net charge-offs. Credit Card Foreign The consumer foreign credit card portfolio is managed in Card Services . Outstandings in the held foreign credit card loan portfolio increased $4.0 billion to $15.0 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, organic growth and portfolio acquisitions. Net charge-offs for the held foreign portfolio increased $153 million to $378 million, or 3.06 percent of total average held credit card foreign loans compared to 2.46 percent (3.05 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. The increases in held net charge-offs were due to seasoning of the European portfolio and strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Managed foreign credit card outstandings increased $3.9 billion to $31.8 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the same reasons as the increase in held outstandings stated above. Net losses for the managed foreign portfolio increased $274 million to $1.3 billion, or 4.24 percent of total average managed credit card foreign loans compared to 3.95 percent (4.17 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. The increases in managed net losses were due to the same reasons as the increases in held net charge-offs stated above. See page 48 for a discussion of the impact of SOP 03-3 on managed losses and net charge-offs. Home Equity At December 31, 2007, approximately 74 percent of the managed home equity portfolio was included in GCSBB , while the remainder of the portfolio was mostly in GWIM . This portfolio consists of both revolving and non-revolving first and second lien residential mortgage loans and lines of credit. On a held basis, outstanding home equity loans increased $26.9 billion, or 31 percent, at December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, largely due to organic home equity production and the LaSalle acquisition. Nonperforming home equity loans increased $1.0 billion and net charge-offs increased $223 million to $274 million or 0.28 percent of total average held home equity loans compared to 0.07 percent in 2006. These increases were driven by deterioration in the housing markets, including significant declines in home prices in certain geographic areas, as well as the seasoning of the portfolio reflective of growth. Although it remains unclear how long the recent and accelerated declines in the consumer housing markets will continue, this recent deterioration will negatively impact our home equity portfolio and will result in a higher provision for credit losses. Direct/Indirect Consumer At December 31, 2007, approximately 50 percent of the managed direct/indirect portfolio was included in Business Lending (automotive, marine, motorcycle and recreational vehicle loans); 44 percent was included in GCSBB (student and other non-real estate secured and unsecured personal loans) and the remainder was included in GWIM (other non-real estate secured and unsecured personal loans). On a held basis, outstanding loans and leases increased $17.5 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 due to growth in the Card Services unsecured lending product, retail automotive portfolio purchases and reduced securitization activity. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest increased $367 million due to portfolio seasoning reflective of growth in the businesses and reduced securitization activity. Net charge-offs increased $763 million to $1.4 billion, or 1.95 percent of total average held direct/indirect loans compared to 1.14 percent (1.36 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. The increases were primarily driven by growth, seasoning and increases from the unusually low charge-off levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform in the Card Services unsecured lending portfolio, growth, seasoning and deterioration in the retail automotive and other dealer-related portfolios and the impact of the Corporation discontinuing sales of receivables into the unsecured lending trust. Managed direct/indirect loans outstanding increased $12.3 billion to $78.6 billion in 2007 compared to 2006, driven by growth in the Card Services unsecured lending product and retail automotive portfolio purchases. Net losses for the managed loan portfolio increased $678 million to $1.6 billion, or 2.14 percent of total average managed direct/indirect loans compared to 1.49 percent (1.69 percent excluding the impact of SOP 03-3) in 2006. The increases were primarily driven by growth, seasoning and increases from the unusually low loss levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform in the Card Services unsecured lending portfolio and higher losses in the retail automotive and other dealer-related portfolios due to growth, seasoning and deterioration. See page 48 for a discussion of the impact of SOP 03-3 on managed losses and net charge-offs. Other Consumer At December 31, 2007, approximately 78 percent of the other consumer portfolio was primarily associated with the portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we have previously exited and was included in All Other . The remainder consisted of the foreign consumer loan portfolio which was mostly included in Card Services . Other consumer outstanding loans and leases decreased $1.2 billion, or 24 percent, at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, driven mainly by the sale of our Latin American operations. The Corporation classifies deposit overdraft charge-offs as other consumer. Net charge-offs increased $61 million, or 357 bps, compared to 2006 driven by overdraft net charge-offs associated with deposit account growth. Bank of America 2007 47 Table of Contents SOP 03-3 SOP 03-3 addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor initial investment in loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. SOP 03-3 requires that impaired loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this SOP (categories of loans for which it is probable, at the time of acquisition, that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected). The prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan, a pool of loans, a group of loans, and loans acquired in a purchase business combination. In accordance with SOP 03-3, certain acquired loans of LaSalle in 2007 and MBNA in 2006 that were considered impaired were written down to fair value at the acquisition date. Therefore, reported net charge-offs and managed net losses were lower since these impaired loans that would have been charged off during the period were reduced to fair value as of the acquisition date. SOP 03-3 does not apply to the acquired loans that have been securitized as they are not held on the Corporation Balance Sheet. Consumer net charge-offs, managed net losses, and associated ratios excluding the impact of SOP 03-3 for 2007 and 2006 are presented in Table 14. Management believes that excluding the impact of SOP 03-3 provides a more accurate reflection of portfolio credit quality. Table 14 Consumer Net Charge-offs/Managed Net Losses (Excluding the Impact of SOP 03-3) (1, 2, 3, 4) Held Managed Net Charge-offs Ratio Net Losses Ratio (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Residential mortgage $ 59 $ 39 0.02 % 0.02 % $ 59 $ 39 0.02 % 0.02 % Credit card domestic 3,063 3,193 5.29 5.00 6,960 5,494 4.91 3.96 Credit card foreign 378 278 3.06 3.05 1,254 1,033 4.24 4.17 Home equity 282 51 0.29 0.07 282 51 0.29 0.07 Direct/Indirect consumer 1,375 729 1.96 1.36 1,605 1,044 2.14 1.69 Other consumer 278 217 6.54 2.97 278 217 6.54 2.97 Total consumer $ 5,435 $ 4,507 1.07 1.07 $ 10,438 $ 7,878 1.69 1.50 (1) Excluding the impact of SOP 03-3 is a non-GAAP financial measure. The impact of SOP 03-3 on average outstanding held and managed consumer loans and leases in 2007 and 2006 was not material. (2) Net charge-off/loss ratios are calculated as held net charge-offs or managed net losses divided by average outstanding held or managed loans and leases during the year for each loan and lease category. (3) Historical ratios have been adjusted for home equity, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer due to the reclassification of home equity loan balances from direct/indirect consumer to home equity, and certain foreign consumer loans from other consumer to direct/indirect consumer. (4) Including the impact of SOP 03-3 would decrease net charge-offs on residential mortgage $2 million, home equity $8 million, direct/indirect consumer $2 million in 2007. Including the impact of SOP 03-3 would decrease net charge-offs on credit card domestic $99 million, credit card foreign $53 million and direct/indirect consumer $119 million in 2006. 48 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Table 15 Nonperforming Consumer Assets Activity (1) (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Nonperforming loans and leases Balance, January 1 $ 1,030 $ 785 Additions to nonperforming loans and leases: LaSalle balance, October 1, 2007 232 New nonaccrual loans and leases 3,829 1,432 Reductions in nonperforming loans and leases: Paydowns and payoffs (260 ) (157 ) Sales (117 ) Returns to performing status (2) (855 ) (698 ) Charge-offs (3) (374 ) (150 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (152 ) (65 ) Transfers to loans held-for-sale (8 ) Total net additions to nonperforming loans and leases 2,412 245 Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 31 3,442 1,030 Foreclosed properties Balance, January 1 59 61 Additions to foreclosed properties: LaSalle balance, October 1, 2007 70 New foreclosed properties 468 159 Reductions in foreclosed properties: Sales (82 ) (76 ) Writedowns (239 ) (85 ) Total net additions to (reductions in) foreclosed properties 217 (2 ) Total foreclosed properties, December 31 276 59 Nonperforming consumer assets, December 31 $ 3,718 $ 1,089 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases 0.62 % 0.22 % Nonperforming consumer assets as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties 0.67 0.23 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming loans held-for-sale included in other assets of $95 million and $30 million in 2007 and 2006. (2) Consumer loans and leases may be restored to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (3) Our policy is not to classify consumer credit card and consumer non-real estate loans and leases as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity. Nonperforming Consumer Assets Activity Table 15 presents the additions and reductions to nonperforming assets in the held consumer portfolio during 2007 and 2006. Net additions to nonperforming loans and leases in 2007 were $2.4 billion compared to $245 million in 2006. The increase in 2007 was driven by seasoning of the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios reflective of growth in these businesses and the weakening housing market. The nonperforming consumer loans and leases ratio increased 40 bps compared to 2006 driven by increases in the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios, especially in geographic regions most impacted by home price declines and in part due to our Community Reinvestment Act portfolio. These factors also drove the increase in foreclosed properties of $217 million and home price declines drove higher writedowns. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of their financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower or counterparty, most of our commercial credit exposure or transactions are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis. If necessary, risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow or financial situation of a borrower or counterparty. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. Risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our lines of business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations Portfolio credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure, and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography and customer relationship. Distribution of loans and leases by loan size is an additional measure of the portfolio risk diversification. We also review, measure, and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate borrowings by region and by country. Tables 19, 21, 24 and 25 summarize our concentrations. Additionally, we utilize syndication of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio. Bank of America 2007 49 Table of Contents From the perspective of portfolio risk management, customer concentration management is most relevant in GCIB . Within that segment Business Lending and CMAS businesses, we facilitate bridge financing (high grade debt, high yield debt, CMBS and equity) to fund acquisitions, recapitalizations and other short-term needs as well as provide syndicated financing for our clients. These concentrations are managed in part through our established originate to distribute strategy. These client transactions are sometimes large and leveraged. They can also have a higher degree of risk as we are providing offers or commitments for various components of the clients capital structures, including lower rated unsecured and subordinated debt tranches and/or equity. In many cases, these offers to finance will not be accepted. If accepted, these conditional commitments are often retired prior to or shortly following funding via the placement of securities, syndication or the client decision to terminate. Where we have a binding commitment and there is a market disruption or other unexpected event, there may be heightened exposure in the portfolios and forward calendar, and a higher potential for writedown or loss unless the terms of the commitment can be modified and/or an orderly disposition of the exposure can be made. The Corporation share of the leveraged finance and CMBS forward calendars were $12.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Funded leveraged finance and CMBS exposure included in assets held-for-sale totaled $6.1 billion and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2007. The funded CMBS exposure includes amounts assumed with the acquisition of LaSalle. The funded CMBS debt consisted of $6.9 billion of floating-rate acquisition related financings to major, well known operating companies. In addition, of the CMBS forward calendar, $1.1 billion were floating-rate acquisition related financings. Writedowns were taken on both funded and forward calendar commitments to reflect the current market prices, if available, or the estimated price at which the exposures could be distributed in the market. In the first quarter of 2008 the leveraged finance markets began to experience disruptions similar to those experienced in the second half of 2007 and it is unclear what impact these conditions will have on our results. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Corporation accounted for all loans in the held-to-maturity portfolio on a historical cost basis and incurred losses on this portfolio were charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation elected to account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments (including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes), which exceed the Corporation single name credit risk concentration guidelines at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159. The Corporation initially adopted the fair value option for $4.0 billion of outstanding commercial loans as of January 1, 2007 and recorded pre-tax net losses of $21 million (net of adjustments related to the allowance for loan and lease losses and direct loan origination fees and costs) representing the excess of carrying value over fair value of the funded loans, with the after-tax amount recorded in retained earnings. The Corporation also initially adopted the fair value option for $21.1 billion of unfunded commercial commitments, including letters of credit, as of January 1, 2007, and recorded pre-tax net losses of $321 million (net of associated adjustments related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments) representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the unfunded lending commitments, with the after-tax amount recorded in retained earnings. After the initial application of SFAS 159, any fair value adjustment upon origination and subsequent changes in the fair value of loans and unfunded commitments is recorded in other income. By including the credit risk of the borrower in the fair value adjustments, any credit deterioration or improvement is recorded immediately as part of the fair value adjustment. As a result, the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are no longer used to capture credit losses inherent in these nonperforming or impaired loans and unfunded commitments. The remaining Commercial Credit Portfolio tables have been modified to exclude loans and unfunded commitments that are carried at fair value and to adjust certain ratios for this accounting change. See Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the adoption of SFAS 159. At December 31, 2007, outstanding commercial loans measured at fair value had an aggregate fair value of $4.59 billion recorded in loans and leases and included commercial domestic loans of $3.50 billion, commercial foreign loans of $790 million and commercial real estate loans of $304 million. The Corporation recorded net losses of $139 million in other income resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio during 2007. In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit had an aggregate fair value of $660 million and were recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The December 31, 2007 aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit subject to fair value treatment was $20.9 billion. Net losses resulting from changes in fair value of commitments and letters of credit of $274 million were recorded in other income during 2007. Commercial Credit Portfolio Commercial credit quality indicators deteriorated from favorable levels experienced in 2006, in part attributable to the weakness in the housing and financial markets. The loans and leases net charge-off ratio increased to 0.40 percent from 0.13 percent a year ago. The increase was principally attributable to seasoning and deterioration in our small business portfolio in GCSBB as well as a lower level of commercial recoveries in GCIB and GWIM . Excluding small business commercial domestic the total commercial net charge-off ratio was 0.08 percent compared to a net recovery ratio of 0.03 percent in 2006, primarily due to a lower level of recoveries in 2007. The nonperforming loan and commercial utilized criticized exposure ratios were 0.67 percent and 4.17 percent at December 31, 2007 compared to 0.31 percent and 2.20 percent at December 31, 2006, mostly related to the addition of LaSalle and exposure to the homebuilder and mortgage lender sectors. 50 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Table 16 presents our commercial loans and leases and related credit quality information for 2007 and 2006.

The increase in 2007 to commercial committed exposure was due to the addition of LaSalle and organic growth as discussed in the sections on the following pages. The increase in derivative assets of $11.2 billion was centered in credit derivatives, interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, and was driven by growth in the businesses, widening credit spreads and the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.

Balances and ratios have been adjusted to exclude assets held-for-sale at December 31, 2007 and 2006 and exposure measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159 at December 31, 2007. Had criticized exposure in the assets held-for-sale and fair value portfolios been included, the ratio of commercial utilized criticized exposure to total commercial utilized exposure would have been 4.77 percent and 2.23 percent at December 31, 2007 and 2006. (2) Exposure includes standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers acceptances for which the bank is legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. (3) Ratios are calculated as commercial utilized criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized exposure for each exposure category. (4) Excludes small business commercial domestic exposure. Table 18 presents commercial utilized criticized exposure by product type and as a percentage of total commercial utilized exposure. Commercial utilized criticized exposure increased $10.5 billion, or 149 percent, primarily due to increases in commercial real estate and commercial domestic of which LaSalle contributed $5.1 billion as discussed in more detail in the product sections below. The table above excludes utilized criticized exposure related to assets held-for-sale of $2.9 billion and $600 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006 and other utilized criticized exposure measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159 of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007. See Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the fair value portfolio. Criticized assets in the held-for-sale portfolio, are carried at the lower of cost or market, including bridge exposure of $2.3 billion and $550 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006 which funded in the normal course of our Business Lending and CMAS businesses and are managed in part through our originate to distribute strategy (see Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations beginning on page 49 for more information on bridge financing). The level of funded, criticized bridge exposures in the held-for-sale portfolio increased as a result of adverse market conditions in the second half of 2007. Had criticized exposure in the assets held-for-sale and fair value portfolios been included, the ratio of commercial utilized criticized exposure to total commercial utilized exposure would have been 4.77 percent and 2.23 percent at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Commercial Domestic At December 31, 2007, approximately 89 percent of the commercial domestic portfolio, excluding small business, was included in Business Lending (business banking, middle market and large multinational corporate loans and leases) and CMAS (acquisition and bridge financing). The remaining 11 percent was mostly in GWIM (business-purpose loans for wealthy individuals). Outstanding commercial domestic loans and leases including loans measured at fair value, increased $45.8 billion to $194.0 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 driven primarily by an increase in loans within GCIB related to the addition of LaSalle and organic growth. Nonperforming commercial domestic loans increased by $364 million to $869 million primarily driven by the addition of LaSalle. Net charge-offs were up $163 million from 2006 driven primarily by a lower level of recoveries. Criticized utilized commercial domestic exposure excluding assets in the held-for-sale and fair value portfolios, increased $4.0 billion to $8.8 billion primarily driven by the addition of LaSalle, higher exposure to mortgage lenders and asset-based lending. Commercial Real Estate The commercial real estate portfolio is mostly managed in Business Lending and consists of loans issued primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans and leases, including loans measured at fair value, increased $25.3 billion to $61.6 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was related to the acquisition of LaSalle, which increased outstandings by approximately $18.8 billion, and organic growth. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions with increases in Illinois, the Midwest and California largely related to the addition of LaSalle. Organic growth was strong in the Northeast and in retail, office and apartment property types. The addition of LaSalle contributed to growth in residential and broadly across all other property types. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans increased $981 million to $1.1 billion and utilized criticized exposure increased $6.0 billion to $6.8 billion attributable to the continuing impact of the housing slowdown on the homebuilding sector as well as the addition of LaSalle. Nonperforming loans and utilized criticized exposure in the homebuilding sector were $792 million and $5.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007 compared to $71 million and $348 million at December 31, 2006. Net charge-offs were up $44 million from 2006 principally related to the homebuilder sector of the portfolio. At December 31, 2007, we had homebuilder-related exposure of $13.6 billion in loans and $21.6 billion in commercial committed exposure, of which 39 percent was criticized and six percent was classified as nonperforming. Assets held-for-sale associated with commercial real estate increased $8.6 billion to $13.8 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to 2006, driven by reduced market liquidity resulting in a higher level of warehoused assets pending commercial mortgage-backed securitizations and the addition of LaSalle. Refer to Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations on page 49 for a discussion of our CMBS exposure. 52 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Table 19 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region and property type diversification.

(2) Distribution is based on geographic location of collateral. Geographic regions are in the U.S. unless otherwise noted. (3) The geographically diversified category is comprised primarily of unsecured outstandings to real estate investment trusts and national home builders whose portfolios of properties span multiple geographic regions. (4) Includes commercial real estate loans measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159 of $304 million at December 31, 2007. (5) Represents loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate, but the exposure is not secured by the listed property types. Commercial Lease Financing The commercial lease financing portfolio is managed in Business Lending . Outstanding loans and leases increased $718 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the addition of LaSalle which was partially offset by the adoption of FSP 13-2. Net charge-offs were $2 million compared to net recoveries of $28 million in 2006. Commercial Foreign The commercial foreign portfolio is managed primarily in Business Lending and CMAS . Outstanding loans and leases, including loans measured at fair value, increased by $8.5 billion to $29.2 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 driven by organic growth combined with strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the sale of our Latin American operations. Criticized utilized exposure, excluding criticized assets in the held-for-sale and fair value portfolios, decreased $62 million to $509 million, primarily attributable to the sale of our Latin American operations. Net charge-offs were $1 million compared to net recoveries of $8 million in 2006. This increase was driven primarily by a lower level of recoveries in our large corporate portfolio. For additional information on the commercial foreign portfolio, refer to the Foreign Portfolio discussion beginning on page 56. Small Business Commercial Domestic The small business commercial domestic portfolio (business card and small business loans) is managed in GCSBB . Outstanding small business commercial domestic loans and leases increased $4.0 billion to $17.8 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 driven by organic growth in the small business card portfolio. Approximately 64 percent of the small business commercial domestic outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2007 was credit card related products. Nonperforming small business commercial domestic loans increased $56 million to $135 million, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest increased $228 million to $427 million and criticized loans increased $419 million or 174 bps, to $796 million, or 4.46 percent, at December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Small business commercial domestic net charge-offs were up $508 million, or 257 bps, to $869 million, or 5.57 percent. The increases were driven by portfolio seasoning as well as deterioration particularly in states with the weakest housing markets. Approximately 70 percent of the small business commercial domestic net charge-offs for 2007 were credit card related products. Bank of America 2007 53 Table of Contents Nonperforming Commercial Assets Activity Table 20 presents the additions and reductions to nonperforming assets in the commercial portfolio during 2007 and 2006. The increase in nonaccrual loans and leases for 2007 was primarily attributable to homebuilder and mortgage company exposure, and the addition of LaSalle.

There were no nonperforming loans measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159 in 2007. See Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in the fair value portfolio during 2007. (2) Includes small business commercial domestic activity. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be restored to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (4) Certain loan and lease products, including business card, are not classified as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity. Industry Concentrations Table 21 presents commercial committed and commercial utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and the unfunded portion of certain credit exposure. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits, as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The CRC oversees industry limits governance. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased by $167.9 billion, or 27 percent, in 2007 compared to 2006, with $86.6 billion, or 52 percent of the increase, attributable to LaSalle. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased by $108.4 billion, or 31 percent, in 2007 compared to 2006, with $57.6 billion, or 53 percent, of the increase attributable to LaSalle. The overall commercial credit utilization rate was largely unchanged year over year, increasing from 56 percent to 57 percent. Real estate remains our largest industry concentration, accounting for 14 percent of total commercial committed exposure at December 31, 2007. Growth of $38.2 billion, or 52 percent, was driven primarily by LaSalle, which contributed $27.0 billion. Diversified financials grew by $19.1 billion, or 28 percent, due to a combination of increased activity in interest rate products, client transactions booked in the bank sponsored multi-seller conduits, and LaSalle. Government and public education exposure increased $18.2 billion, or 46 percent, due primarily to financing commitments to student lenders. Retailing exposure grew by $11.1 billion, or 25 percent, principally due to LaSalle. Capital goods grew by $15.0 billon, or 40 percent, attributed equally to organic growth and LaSalle. Monolines exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under the insurance portfolio industry limits. Direct commercial committed exposure to monolines, consisted of revolvers of $203 million and net mark-to-market derivative exposure, of $420 million at December 31, 2007. We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations, credit enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying 54 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents securities. In the case of default we first look to the underlying securities and then to recovery on the purchased insurance. See page 28 for discussion on credit protection purchased on our CDO exposure. We also have indirect exposure as we invest in securities where the issuers have purchased wraps (i.e., insurance). For example, municipalities and corporations purchase protection in order to enhance their pricing power which has the effect of reducing their cost of borrowings. If the rating agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on the market value of the security. We have further exposure related to our public finance business where we are the lead manager or remarketing agent for transactions that are wrapped including auction rate securities (ARS), tender option municipal bonds (TOBs), and variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs). We are the lead manager on municipal and, to a lesser extent, student loan ARS where a high percentage of the programs are wrapped by either monolines or other financial guarantors. However, we are only the remarketing agent on TOBs and VRDBs transactions. Recent concerns about monoline downgrades or insolvency has caused disruptions in each of these markets as investor concerns have impacted overall market liquidity and bond prices. We continue to have liquidity exposure to these markets and instruments, and as market conditions continue to evolve, these conditions may impact our results. For information on our liquidity exposure to our public finance business, see the municipal bond trusts and corporate SPEs discussion beginning on page 37. Credit protection is purchased to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposure. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. Since December 31, 2006, our net credit default protection purchased has been reduced by $1.1 billion to $7.1 billion as we continue to reposition the level of purchased protection based on our current view of the underlying credit risk in the portfolio. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio of $7.1 billion and $8.3 billion. The net mark-to-market impacts, including the cost of credit default protection, resulted in net gains of $160 million in 2007 compared to net losses of $241 million in 2006. The average VAR for these credit derivative hedges was $22 million and $54 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The decrease in VAR was driven by a reduction in the average amount of credit protection outstanding during the year. There is a diversification effect between the credit derivative hedges and the market-based trading portfolio such that their combined average VAR was $55 million and $57 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Refer to the Trading Risk Management discussion beginning on page 62 for a description of our VAR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio.

(2) In addition to unrated names, NR includes $550 million and $302 million in net credit default swaps index positions at December 31, 2007 and 2006. While index positions are principally investment grade, credit default swaps indices include names in and across each of the ratings categories. Foreign Portfolio Our foreign credit and trading portfolio is subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political developments, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage foreign risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk including cross-border risk is provided by the Country Risk Committee. Table 24 presents total foreign exposure broken out by region at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Total foreign exposure includes credit exposure net of local liabilities, securities, and other investments domiciled in countries other than the United States. Credit card exposure is reported on a funded basis. Total foreign exposure can be adjusted for externally guaranteed exposure and certain collateral types. Exposure which is assigned external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposure with tangible collateral is reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross- border resale agreements, exposure is assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting rules. Our total foreign exposure was $138.1 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $8.1 billion from December 31, 2006. Europe accounted for $74.7 billion, or 54 percent, of total foreign exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries with the largest concentration in the commercial sector which accounted for approximately 46 percent of the total exposure in Europe. The decline of $10.6 billion was driven by lower cross-border other financing exposure, as well as higher local funding available to net against local exposures in the United Kingdom. Asia Pacific was our second largest foreign exposure at $42.1 billion, or 30 percent, of total foreign exposure at December 31, 2007. The growth of $14.7 billion in Asia Pacific was primarily driven by the fair value adjustment associated with our CCB investment. Table 24 Regional Foreign Exposure (1, 2, 3) December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Europe $ 74,725 $ 85,279 Asia Pacific 42,081 27,403 Latin America 10,944 8,998 Middle East 1,481 811 Africa 470 317 Other 8,361 7,131 Total regional foreign exposure $ 138,062 $ 129,939 (1) In the balances above, local funding or liabilities are subtracted from local exposures as allowed by the FFIEC. (2) Exposures have been reduced by $6.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2006 related to the cash applied as collateral to derivative assets. (3) Generally, cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting rules. Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded from this presentation. 56 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Latin America accounted for $10.9 billion, or eight percent of total foreign exposure at December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 22 percent, from December 31, 2006. The increase in exposure in Latin America was primarily due to higher exposures in Brazil, Mexico, and Chile. For more information on our Asia Pacific and Latin America exposure, see the discussion below on foreign exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets. At December 31, 2007, China was the only country where total cross-border exposure of $17.0 billion, which mostly related to our investment in CCB, was between 0.75 percent and 1.00 percent of total assets. At December 31, 2007, we did not operate in any country where the total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the United Kingdom had total cross-border exposure of $12.7 billion and $17.3 billion representing 0.74 percent and 1.18 percent of total assets. As presented in Table 25, foreign exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets increased $19.6 billion to $40.4 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to $20.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the fair value adjustment associated with our CCB investment as well as higher exposures across most categories in all regions. Foreign exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented 29 percent and 16 percent of total foreign exposure at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007, 71 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Asia Pacific, compared to 58 percent at December 31, 2006. Asia Pacific emerging markets exposure increased by $16.5 billion. Growth was driven by higher cross-border exposure mainly in China, India, South Korea and Singapore. Our exposure in China was primarily related to the carrying value of our equity investment in CCB which accounted for $16.4 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007, 23 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Latin America compared to 36 percent at December 31, 2006. Latin America emerging markets exposure increased by $2.0 billion driven by higher cross-border exposure in Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, as well as an increase in our equity investment in Banco Ita . During the first quarter of 2007, the Corporation completed the sale of its operations in Chile and Uruguay for approximately $750 million in equity of Banco Ita . The carrying value of our investment in Banco Ita accounted for $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion of exposure in Brazil at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The December 31, 2007 equity investment in Banco Ita represents seven percent of its outstanding voting and non-voting shares. Our investment in Banco Ita is currently carried at cost and will be accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities and carried at fair value beginning in the second quarter of 2008.

The definition that we use includes all countries in Asia Pacific excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand; all countries in Latin America excluding Cayman Islands and Bermuda; all countries in Middle East and Africa; and all countries in Central and Eastern Europe excluding Greece. There was no emerging market exposure included in the portfolio measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159 at December 31, 2007. (2) Includes acceptances, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. (3) Derivative assets are reported on a mark-to-market basis and have been reduced by the amount of cash collateral applied of $57 million and $9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 there were $2 million and less than $1 million of other marketable securities collateralizing derivative assets for which credit risk has not been reduced. (4) Generally, cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent with FFIEC reporting rules. Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded from this presentation. (5) Cross-border exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers or counterparties with a country of residence other than the one in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, consistent with FFIEC reporting rules. (6) Local country exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers with a country of residence in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated. Local funding or liabilities are subtracted from local exposures as allowed by the FFIEC. Total amount of available local liabilities funding local country exposure at December 31, 2007 was $21.6 billion compared to $20.7 billion at December 31, 2006. Local liabilities at December 31, 2007 in Asia Pacific and Latin America were $19.7 billion and $1.9 billion, of which $7.9 billion were in Hong Kong, $6.2 billion in Singapore, $2.5 billion in South Korea, $1.8 billion in Mexico, $1.1 billion in China, $836 million in India, and $508 million in Taiwan. There were no other countries with available local liabilities funding local country exposure greater than $500 million. (7) Securities/Other Investments include an investment of $16.4 billion in CCB. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Corporation equity investment in CCB was accounted for at fair value. Previously, the investment in CCB was accounted for at cost. (8) No country included in Other Asia Pacific, Other Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe had total foreign exposure of more than $500 million. Bank of America 2007 57 Table of Contents The increased exposures in Mexico were attributable to higher cross-border corporate securities trading exposure and loans and loan commitments. Our 24.9 percent investment in Santander accounted for $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion of exposure in Mexico at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, five percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and Africa. Middle East and Africa emerging markets exposure increased by $825 million driven by higher cross-border other financing exposure and loans and loan commitments. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $3.4 billion, or 67 percent, to $8.4 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. The consumer portion of the provision for credit losses increased $1.8 billion to $6.5 billion compared to 2006. Higher net charge-offs from portfolio seasoning, reflective of growth in the businesses and increases from the unusually low charge-off levels experienced in 2006 post bankruptcy reform drove a portion of the increase. Additionally, reserve increases related to higher losses inherent in our home equity portfolio, reflecting growth in the business and the impact of the weak housing market, as well as seasoning of the Card Services consumer portfolios contributed to the increased provision expense. The increases were partially offset by reserve reductions from the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitization trust and to a lesser extent, improved performance of the remaining portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we have previously exited. The commercial portion of the provision for credit losses increased $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion compared to 2006. Higher net charge-offs from seasoning and deterioration in our small business portfolios within GCSBB as well as a lower level of commercial recoveries in GCIB and GWIM drove a portion of the increase. Reserve increases for seasoning of growth and deterioration in the small business portfolio within GCSBB , the absence of prior year reserve releases in GCIB and portfolio deterioration reflecting the impact of the weak housing market, particularly on our homebuilder loan portfolio within GCIB , also drove the year over year increase. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of reserves in All Other reflecting the sale of our Argentina portfolio during the first quarter of 2007. The provision for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments was $28 million in 2007 compared to $9 million in 2006. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans measured at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159 as subsequent mark-to-market adjustments related to loans measured at fair value include a credit risk component. The allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on two components. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of these two components. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers those commercial loans measured at historical cost that are either nonperforming or impaired. An allowance is allocated when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) are lower than the carrying value of that loan. For purposes of computing the specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product type and risk rating of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers performing consumer and commercial loans and leases measured at historical cost. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic or obligor concentrations within each portfolio segment, and any other pertinent information. The commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2007, quarterly updating of historical loss experience did not have a material impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2007, quarterly updating of the loss forecast models resulted in increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses primarily due to growth and seasoning of the consumer portfolios and higher inherent losses in the home equity and small business portfolios. Included within this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single name defaults. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in Table 27 was $6.8 billion at December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.2 billion from December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to an increase in reserves during 2007 for higher losses inherent in our home equity portfolio reflective of the impact of the weak housing market as well as growth and seasoning of the Card Services consumer portfolios. These increases were partially offset by reserve reductions from the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitizations trust, net new issuances of securitizations, and improved performance of the remaining portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we have previously exited. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2007, a $1.4 billion increase from December 31, 2006. The LaSalle acquisition increased the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses $676 million. In addition, the increase in commercial domestic allowance levels was primarily attributable to an increase in reserves for higher losses inherent in the small business portfolio within GCSBB . Commercial real estate allowance levels increased mainly due to the LaSalle acquisition and portfolio deterioration reflecting the impact of the weak housing market, particularly on our homebuilder loan portfolio within GCIB . Commercial foreign allowance levels decreased due to the sales of our Latin American portfolios and operations. 58 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.33 percent at December 31, 2007, compared to 1.28 percent at December 31, 2006. The increase in the ratio was driven by reserve increases for higher inherent losses in the small business and home equity portfolios within GCSBB , reflecting growth of these businesses and deterioration in the portfolios, and seasoning of the Card Services unsecured lending portfolio as well as discontinuing sales of new receivables into the unsecured lending trust. These increases were partially offset by growth in the residential mortgage portfolio, which has a low loss profile, as the Corporation increased retention of residential mortgage loans for ALM purposes. Also offsetting the increases were reserve reductions related to the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitization trust and the sales of our Latin American portfolios and operations. Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments measured at historical cost, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, except utilization assumptions are considered. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes to the reserve generally made through the provision for credit losses. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2007 was $518 million, a $121 million increase from December 31, 2006 primarily driven by the acquisition of LaSalle.

(4) In 2007, the impact of SOP 03-3 decreased net charge-offs by $75 million. Excluding the impact of SOP 03-3, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding measured at historical cost in 2007 would have been 0.85 percent and the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to net charge-offs would have been 1.77 percent at December 31, 2007. (5) In 2006, the impact of SOP 03-3 decreased net charge-offs by $288 million. Excluding the impact of SOP 03-3, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding measured at historical cost in 2006 would have been 0.74 percent, and the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to net charge-offs would have been 1.87 percent at December 31, 2006. 60 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents For reporting purposes, we allocate the allowance for credit losses across products. However, the allowance is available to absorb any credit losses without restriction. Table 27 presents our allocation by product type.

Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and proprietary trading operations, ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). GAAP requires a historical cost view of traditional banking assets and liabilities. However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to fair value certain loan and deposit products in accordance with SFAS 159. For further information on fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include related derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards and deposits. Mortgage Risk Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, other interest rates and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages, and collateralized mortgage obligations including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of mortgage-backed securities which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage secu- Bank of America 2007 61 Table of Contents rities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 21 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, forwards, swaps, swaptions and securities. Equity Market Risk Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange traded funds, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), over-the-counter equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. Commodity Risk Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power, and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. Issuer Credit Risk Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration, or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed income instruments. Market Liquidity Risk Market liquidity risk represents the risk that expected market activity changes dramatically and in certain cases may even cease to exist. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact in an orderly manner and may impact our results. This impact could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are impacted by the disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management. Trading Risk Management Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on page 68. Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. The GRC, chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALCO as the primary governance authority for Global Markets Risk Management including trading risk management. The GRC focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting CMAS and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. At the GRC meetings, the committee considers significant daily revenues and losses by business along with an explanation of the primary driver of the revenue or loss. Thresholds are established for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is made to the GRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses which exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility. 62 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents The histogram of daily revenue or loss above is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 71 percent of the trading days. During the second half of 2007, CDO- related markets experienced significant liquidity constraints impacting the availability and reliability of transparent pricing resulting in the valuation of CDOs becoming more complex and time consuming. Accordingly, it was not possible to mark these positions to market on a daily basis. As a result, we recorded valuation adjustments in trading account profits (losses) of approximately $4.0 billion on certain discrete dates relating to our super senior CDO exposure. For further discussion of our super senior CDO exposure and related losses see page 28. Excluding the discrete writedowns on our super senior CDO exposure, 21 percent of the total trading days had losses greater than $10 million, and the largest loss was $159 million. This can be compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 96 percent of the trading days and there were no losses greater than $10 million, and the largest loss was $10 million. The increase in the total trading days with losses greater than $10 million was due to the period of market disruption during the second half of 2007. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VAR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VAR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit excesses are communicated to management for review. A VAR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. The VAR represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence. VAR depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. Within any VAR model, there are sig- nificant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VAR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VAR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products which do not have extensive historical price data, or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. Our VAR model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and assumes a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. A VAR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are however many limitations inherent in a VAR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VAR model. This was of particular relevance in the last part of 2007 when markets experienced a period of extreme illiquidity resulting in losses that were far outside of the normal loss forecasts by VAR models. Due to these limitations, we have historically used the VAR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to various degrees. See discussion on stress testing on the following page. On a quarterly basis, the accuracy of the VAR methodology is reviewed by backtesting (i.e., comparing actual results against expectations derived from historical data) the VAR results against the daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed the VAR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. Bank of America 2007 63 Table of Contents The graph above shows daily trading-related revenue and VAR excluding the discrete writedowns on our super senior CDO exposure for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Excluding these writedowns, actual losses exceeded daily trading VAR fourteen times in the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and losses did not exceed daily trading VAR in the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The losses that exceeded daily trading VAR for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, occurred during the market disruption which took place during the second half of 2007. The sudden increase in market volatility during this period produced a large number of price changes that exceeded the 99 th percentile of the three year history used for our VAR calculations. Table 28 presents average, high and low daily trading VAR for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase in average VAR from 2006 was driven by the increased market volatility during the second half of 2007. In particular, with the dislocation in structured and credit products, many credit spreads used in the calculation of VAR increased by unprecedented amounts. In addition, many trading assets became extremely illiquid which required changes in assumptions to properly incorporate them in the VAR model as was the case with our CDO exposure for which we have updated our model at various times during the second half of 2007. In periods of stress, the GRC members communicate daily to discuss losses, VAR limit excesses and the impact to regulatory capital. As a result of this process, the lines of business may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macro economic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure. Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VAR model suggests results can exceed our estimates, we also stress test our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various types of stress tests are run regularly against the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes which occurred during a set of extended historical market events. The results of these scenarios are reported daily to management. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, the largest daily losses among these scenarios ranged from $9 million to $529 million.

The table above does not include credit protection purchased to manage our counterparty credit risk. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the average VAR of this protection was $9 million. 64 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Hypothetical scenarios evaluate the potential impact of extreme but plausible events over periods as long as one month. These scenarios are developed to address perceived vulnerabilities in the market and in our portfolios, and are periodically updated. They are also reviewed and updated to reflect changing market conditions, such as were experienced during the second half of 2007. For example, many trading assets became extremely illiquid which required changes in assumptions to properly incorporate them in the stress models. This was the case with our CDO-related exposure for which we have updated our models at various times during the second half of 2007. Management reviews and evaluates results of these scenarios monthly. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, the largest daily losses among these scenarios ranged from $459 million to $1.5 billion. Worst-case losses, which represent the most extreme losses in our daily VAR calculation, are reported daily. Finally, desk-level stress tests are performed daily for individual businesses. These stress tests evaluate the potential adverse impact of large moves in the market risk factors to which those businesses are most sensitive. Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading exposures. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income managed basis. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income managed basis caused by changes in market interest rates. Client facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. Interest rate risk from these activities, as well as the impact of changing market conditions, is managed through our ALM activities. Simulations are used to estimate the impact on core net interest income managed basis using numerous interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends and strategies. These simulations evaluate how the above mentioned scenarios impact core net interest income managed basis on short-term financial instruments, debt securities, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivative instruments. In addition, these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics. These simulations do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. Management analyzes core net interest income managed basis forecasts utilizing different rate scenarios, with the base case utilizing the forward interest rates. Management frequently updates the core net interest income managed basis forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and market conditions. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest income managed basis. These baseline forecasts take into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning, and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by forward interest rates. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have to these static baseline forecasts in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The spot and 12-month forward monthly rates used in our respective baseline forecasts at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are shown in Table 29. Table 30 reflects the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income managed basis over the next twelve months from December 31, 2007 and 2006, resulting from a 100 bp gradual parallel increase, a 100 bp gradual parallel decrease, a 100 bp gradual curve flattening (increase in short-term rates or decrease in long-term rates) and a 100 bp gradual curve steepening (decrease in short-term rates or increase in long-term rates) from the forward market curve. For further discussion of core net interest income managed basis see page 19. The sensitivity analysis in Table 30 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated years. The estimated exposure is reported on a managed basis and reflects impacts that may be realized primarily in net interest income and card income. This sensitivity analysis excludes any impact that could occur in the valuation of retained interests in the Corporation securitizations due to changes in interest rate levels. For additional information on securitizations, see Note 8 Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2007, our core net interest income managed basis became more liability sensitive as we positioned ourselves for greater downside risk than was reflected in the forward curve. We evaluate our balance sheet position on an ongoing basis. Since December 31, 2007, we have repositioned our balance sheet to a more modest level given changes in forward rates and we will continue to evaluate our balance sheet positioning going forward. Over a 12-month horizon, we would benefit from falling rates or a steepening of the yield curve beyond what is already implied in the forward market curve. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. Securities The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position. The securities portfolio is primarily comprised of debt securities and includes mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser extent corporate, municipal and other investment grade debt securities. During 2007 and 2006, we purchased AFS debt securities of $28.0 billion and $40.9 billion, sold $27.9 billion and $55.1 billion, and had maturities and received paydowns of $19.2 billion and $22.4 billion. We realized $180 million in gains and $443 million in losses on sales of debt securities during 2007 and 2006. Additionally, during 2007, we acquired $32.4 billion of AFS debt securities as part of the LaSalle and U.S. Trust Corporation acquisitions and continue to evaluate the appropriate holding levels. The value of our accumulated OCI loss related to AFS debt securities improved by a pre-tax amount of $2.0 billion during 2007, driven by a decrease in interest rates. For those securities that are in an unrealized loss position we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery. Accumulated OCI includes $6.5 billion in after-tax gains at December 31, 2007, related to unrealized gains associated with our AFS securities portfolio, including $1.9 billion of unrealized losses related to AFS debt securities and $8.4 billion of unrealized gains related to AFS marketable equity securities. Total market value of the AFS debt securities was $213.3 billion at December 31, 2007 with a weighted average duration of 4.3 years and primarily relates to our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Prospective changes to the accumulated OCI amounts for the AFS securities portfolio will be driven by further interest rate, credit or price fluctuations (including market value fluctuations associated with our CCB investment), the collection of cash flows including prepayment and maturity activity, and the passage of time. During the fourth quarter of 2007, shares of the Corporation strategic investment in CCB are now accounted for as AFS marketable equity securities and are carried at a fair value of $16.2 billion. The unrealized gain on this investment of $8.4 billion net-of-tax is subject to currency and price fluctuation, and is recorded in accumulated OCI. In connection with adopting SFAS 159, the Corporation reclassified approximately $3.7 billion from AFS debt securities to trading account assets during the first quarter of 2007. There were no net unrealized gains or losses associated with these securities recorded in accumulated OCI as these securities were hedged using SFAS 133 hedge accounting. Accordingly, there was no impact on the Corporation transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of SFAS 159 on January 1, 2007. Residential Mortgage Portfolio During 2007 and 2006, we purchased $22.5 billion and $42.3 billion of residential mortgages related to ALM activities, and added $66.3 billion and $51.9 billion of originated residential mortgages. We sold $34.0 billion and $11.0 billion of residential mortgages during 2007 and 2006, which included $23.7 billion and $9.2 billion of originated residential mortgages, resulting in gains of $271 million and $98 million. Additionally, we received paydowns of $28.2 billion and $24.7 billion during 2007 and 2006. The ending balance at December 31, 2007 was $274.9 billion compared to $241.2 billion at December 31, 2006. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to mitigate our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures, and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as certain equity investments in foreign subsidiaries. Table 31 reflects the notional amounts, fair value, weighted average receive fixed and pay fixed rates, expected maturity, and estimated duration of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio over the course of 2007 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivative portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate environment, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. Our interest rate swap positions (including foreign exchange contracts) changed to a net receive fixed position of $101.9 billion on December 31, 2007 compared to a net receive fixed position of $12.3 billion on December 31, 2006. Changes in the notional levels of our interest rate swap position were driven by the net termination of $88.9 billion in pay fixed swaps, the net termination of $9.5 billion in U.S. dollar denominated receive fixed swaps, and the addition of $10.2 billion in foreign denominated receive fixed swaps. The notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps increased $22.6 billion to $54.5 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $31.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The notional amount of our option position decreased $103.2 billion to $140.1 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $243.3 billion at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the notional amount of options was due to the net terminations and expirations of $85.0 billion in caps and floors and terminations of $18.2 billion of swaptions. 66 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Table 31 Asset and Liability Management Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Contracts December 31, 2007 Fair Value Expected Maturity Average Estimated Duration (Dollars in millions, average estimated duration in years) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Receive fixed interest rate swaps (1, 2) $ 992 3.70 Notional amount $ 81,965 $ 4,869 $ 48,908 $ 3,252 $ 1,630 $ 2,508 $ 20,798 Weighted average fixed rate 4.34 % 4.03 % 3.91 % 4.35 % 4.50 % 4.88 % 5.34 % Pay fixed interest rate swaps (1) (429 ) 5.37 Notional amount $ 11,340 $ $ $ $ $ 1,000 $ 10,340 Weighted average fixed rate 5.04 % % % % % 5.45 % 5.00 % Foreign exchange basis swaps (2, 3, 4) 6,164 Notional amount $ 54,531 $ 2,537 $ 4,463 $ 5,839 $ 4,294 $ 8,695 $ 28,703 Option products (5) (155 ) Notional amount 140,114 130,000 10,000 76 38 Foreign exchange contracts (2, 4, 6) (499 ) Notional amount (7) 31,054 1,438 2,047 4,171 1,235 3,150 19,013 Futures and forward rate contracts (3 ) Notional amount (7) 752 752 Net ALM contracts $ 6,070 December 31, 2006 Fair Value Expected Maturity (Dollars in millions, average estimated duration in years) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Average Estimated Duration Receive fixed interest rate swaps (1, 2) $ (748 ) 4.42 Notional amount $ 91,502 $ 2,795 $ 7,844 $ 48,900 $ 3,252 $ 1,630 $ 27,081 Weighted average fixed rate 4.90 % 4.80 % 4.41 % 4.90 % 4.35 % 4.50 % 5.14 % Pay fixed interest rate swaps (1) 261 2.93 Notional amount $ 100,217 $ 15,000 $ 2,500 $ 44,000 $ $ 250 $ 38,467 Weighted average fixed rate 4.98 % 5.12 % 5.11 % 4.86 % % 5.43 % 5.06 % Foreign exchange basis swaps (2, 3, 4) 1,992 Notional amount $ 31,916 $ 174 $ 2,292 $ 3,012 $ 5,351 $ 3,962 $ 17,125 Option products (5) 317 Notional amount 243,280 200,000 43,176 70 34 Foreign exchange contracts (2, 4, 6) (319 ) Notional amount (7) 20,319 (753 ) 1,588 1,901 3,850 1,104 12,629 Futures and forward rate contracts (46 ) Notional amount (7) 8,480 8,480 Net ALM contracts $ 1,457 (1) At December 31, 2007, $45.0 billion of the receive fixed interest rate swap notional represented forward starting swaps that will not be effective until their respective contractual start dates.

(4) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain foreign debt issued by the Corporation which substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (5) Option products of $140.1 billion at December 31, 2007 are comprised of $120.1 billion in purchased caps and $20.0 billion in sold floors. At December 31, 2006, option products included $225.1 billion in caps and $18.2 billion in swaptions. (6) Foreign exchange contracts include foreign-denominated and cross-currency receive fixed interest rate swaps as well as foreign currency forward rate contracts. Total notional was comprised of $31.3 billion in foreign-denominated and cross-currency receive fixed swaps and $211 million in foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31, 2007 and $21.0 billion in foreign-denominated and cross-currency receive fixed swaps and $697 million in foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31, 2006. (7) Reflects the net of long and short positions. The table above includes derivatives utilized in our ALM activities, including those designated as SFAS 133 accounting hedges and economic hedges. The fair value of net ALM contracts increased $4.6 billion from a gain of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2006 to a gain of $6.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to gains from changes in the value of foreign exchange basis swaps of $4.2 billion, and U.S. dollar denominated receive fixed interest rate swaps of $1.7 billion. These gains were partially offset by losses from changes in the value of pay fixed interest rate swaps of $690 million, option products of $472 million, and foreign exchange contracts of $180 million. The increase in the value of foreign exchange basis swaps was due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the value of U.S. dollar denominated receive fixed interest rate swaps and the decrease in the value of the pay fixed interest rate swaps were due to decreases in interest rates during 2007. The decrease in the value of the option portfolio was primarily attributable to decreases in interest rates during 2007, net terminations and expirations of caps and floors, and terminations of swaptions. The decrease in the value of foreign exchange contracts was largely due to the increase in foreign interest rates during 2007. The Corporation uses interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). From time to time, the Corporation also utilizes equity-indexed derivatives accounted for as SFAS 133 cash flow hedges to minimize exposure to price fluctuations on the forecasted purchase or sale of certain equity investments. The net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, was $4.4 billion at December 31, 2007. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period when the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes to Bank of America 2007 67 Table of Contents prices or interest rates beyond what is already implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2007, the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.3 billion, or 19 percent within the next year, 68 percent within five years, and 89 percent within 10 years, with the remaining 11 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts included in accumulated OCI for terminated derivative contracts were losses of $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, net-of-tax, at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Losses on these terminated derivative contracts are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Mortgage Banking Risk Management IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges of IRLCs and residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2007, the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale was $18.6 billion. The Corporation adopted SFAS 159 as of January 1, 2007 and elected to account for certain originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value. Subsequent to the adoption, mortgage loan origination costs are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. Previously, mortgage loan origination costs would have been capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income upon the sale of such loans. At December 31, 2007, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale in connection with mortgage banking activities for which the fair value option was elected had an aggregate fair value of $9.56 billion and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $9.82 billion. Net gains resulting from changes in fair value of loans held-for-sale that we originated, including realized gains and losses on sale of $333 million, were recorded in mortgage banking income during 2007. The adoption of SFAS 159 resulted in an increase of $256 million in mortgage banking income during 2007, and in an increase of $212 million in noninterest expense during 2007. We manage changes in the value of MSRs by entering into derivative financial instruments. MSRs are a nonfinancial asset created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps as economic hedges of MSRs. At December 31, 2007, the amount of MSRs identified as being hedged by derivatives was approximately $3.1 billion. The notional amount of the derivative contracts designated as economic hedges of MSRs at December 31, 2007 was $69.0 billion. For additional information on MSRs see Note 21 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operational Risk Management Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, including system conversions and integration, and external events. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. We approach operational risk from two perspectives: corporate-wide and line of business-specific. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee provides oversight of significant corporate-wide operational and compliance issues. Within Global Risk Management, Enterprise Operational Risk Management develops policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the Corporation. We also mitigate operational risk through a broad-based approach to process management and process improvement. Improvement efforts are focused on reduction of variation in outputs. We have a dedicated Quality and Productivity team to manage and certify the process management and improvement efforts. For selected risks, we use specialized support groups, such as Information Security and Supply Chain Management, to develop corporate-wide risk management practices, such as an information security program and a supplier program to ensure that suppliers adopt appropriate policies and procedures when performing work on behalf of the Corporation. These specialized groups also assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the individual businesses. These groups also work with line of business executives and risk executives to develop appropriate policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each line of business. Through training and communication efforts, compliance and operational risk awareness is driven across the Corporation. The lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including operational risks. Operational and Compliance Risk executives, working in conjunction with senior line of business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor operational risk in each business line. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business recovery planning and new product introduction processes. In addition, the lines of business are responsible for monitoring adherence to corporate practices. Line of business management uses a self-assessment process, which helps to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of the self-assessment process is to periodically assess changing market and business conditions, to evaluate key operational risks impacting each line of business, and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. In addition to information gathered from the self-assessment process, key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on both a corporate and a line of business level. Recent Accounting and Reporting Developments See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates are summarized below. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation process that, with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the model. Where alternatives exist, we 68 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact net income. Separate from the possible future impact to net income from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet measurement, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation lending activities that are carried at historical cost. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the Credit Risk Management section beginning on page 44 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions made in this process, estimates of the portfolio inherent risks and overall collectibility change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries and individual borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include: (i) risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, (ii) market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, (iii) product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, (iv) loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases, (v) adjustments made to assess current events and conditions, (vi) considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and (vii) overall credit conditions. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and leases. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk rating for commercial loans and leases measured at historical cost and rated under the internal risk rating scale, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loans and lease losses would increase by approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2007. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases measured at historical cost at December 31, 2007 was 1.33 percent and this hypothetical increase in the allowance would raise the ratio to approximately 1.50 percent. Our allowance for loans and lease losses is also sensitive to the loss rates used for the consumer and commercial portfolios. A 10 percent increase in the loss rates used on the consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios measured at historical cost would increase the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2007 by approximately $820 million, of which $690 million would relate to consumer and $130 million to commercial. These sensitivity analyses do not represent management expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of a downgrade of one level of the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases within a short period of time is remote. The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Effective January 1, 2007, we determined the fair market values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in SFAS 157 which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. We carry certain corporate loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, structured reverse repurchase agreements, and long-term deposits at fair value in accordance with SFAS 159. We also carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, MSRs, and certain other assets at fair value. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading account assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value, which is primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets or liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies. At December 31, 2007, $4.0 billion, or two percent, of trading account assets were classified as level 3 fair value assets. No trading account liabilities were classified as level 3 liabilities at December 31, 2007. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other deal specific factors, where appropriate. To ensure the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities, various processes and controls have been adopted, which include: a model validation policy that requires a review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the over-the-counter market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the position. The predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case Bank of America 2007 69 Table of Contents quantitative based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. At December 31, 2007, the level 3 fair values of derivative assets and liabilities determined by these quantitative models were $9.0 billion and $10.2 billion. These amounts reflect the full fair value of the derivatives and do not isolate the discrete value associated with the subjective valuation variable. Further, they represent two percent of both derivative assets and liabilities, before the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements. For 2007, there were no changes to the quantitative models, or uses of such models, that resulted in a material adjustment to the Consolidated Statement of Income. Trading account profits (losses), which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits (losses) are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VAR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. At December 31, 2007, the amount of our VAR was $73 million based on a 99 percent confidence level. For more information on VAR, see Trading Risk Management beginning on page 62. AFS debt and marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value, which is generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Principal Investing Principal Investing is included within Equity Investments in All Other and is discussed in more detail beginning on page 34. Principal Investing is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately-held and publicly-traded companies at all stages of their life cycle, from start-up to buyout. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. Some of these companies may need access to additional cash to support their long-term business models. Market conditions and company performance may impact whether funding is available from private investors or the capital markets. For more information, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 19 Fair Value Disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments with active market quotes are carried at estimated fair value; however, the majority of our investments do not have publicly available price quotations and, therefore, the fair value is unobservable. At December 31, 2007, we had nonpublic investments of $3.5 billion, or approximately 86 percent of the total portfolio. Valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment. We value such investments initially at transaction price and adjust valuations when evidence is available to support such adjustments. Such evidence includes transactions in similar instruments, market comparables, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. Investments are adjusted to estimated fair values at the balance sheet date with changes being recorded in equity investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accrued Income Taxes As more fully described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 18 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109 as interpreted by FIN 48. Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represents the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. In applying the principles of SFAS 109, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets is discussed in detail in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The reporting units utilized for this test were those that are one level below the business segments identified on page 19. The impairment test is performed in two steps. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, as defined in SFAS 142, with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For intangible assets subject to amortization, impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it. An intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset, indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and the market approach and the fair values of the intangible assets were determined using the income approach. For purposes of the income approach, discounted cash flows were calculated by taking the net present value of estimated cash flows using a combination of historical results, estimated future cash flows and an appropriate price to earnings multiple. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Cash flows were discounted using a discount rate based on expected equity return rates, which was 11 percent for 2007. Expected rates of equity returns were estimated based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of 70 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents the reporting unit. For purposes of the market approach, valuations of reporting units were based on actual comparable market transactions and market earnings multiples for similar industries of the reporting unit. Our evaluations for 2007 indicated there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest Entities Under the provisions of FIN 46R, a VIE is consolidated by the entity that will absorb a majority of the variability created by the assets of the VIE. The calculation of variability is based on an analysis of projected probability-weighted cash flows based on the design of the particular VIE. Scenarios in which expected cash flows are less than or greater than the expected outcomes create expected losses or expected residual returns. The entity that will absorb a majority of expected variability (the sum of the absolute values of the expected losses and expected residual returns) consolidates the VIE and is referred to as the primary beneficiary. A variety of qualitative and quantitative assumptions are used to estimate projected cash flows and the relative probability of each potential outcome, and to determine which parties will absorb expected losses and expected residual returns. Critical assumptions, which may include projected credit losses and interest rates, are independently verified against market observable data where possible. Where market observable data is not available, the results of the analysis become more subjective. As certain events occur, we re-evaluate which parties will absorb variability and whether we have become or are no longer the primary beneficiary. Reconsideration events may occur when VIEs acquire additional assets, issue new variable interests or enter into new or modified contractual arrangements. A reconsideration event may also occur when we acquire new or additional interests in a VIE. In the unlikely event we were required to consolidate our unconsolidated VIEs, their consolidation would increase our assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on our Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage Capital ratios. For more information, see Note 9 Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2006 Compared to 2005 The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for 2006 and 2005. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables 5 and 6 contain financial data to supplement this discussion. Overview Net Income Net income totaled $21.1 billion, or $4.59 per diluted common share, in 2006 compared to $16.5 billion, or $4.04 per diluted common share, in 2005. The return on average common shareholders equity was 16.27 percent in 2006 compared to 16.51 percent in 2005. These earnings provided sufficient cash flow to allow us to return $21.2 billion and $10.6 billion in 2006 and 2005, in capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, net of employee stock options exercised. Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.2 billion to $35.8 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. The primary drivers of the increase were the impact of the MBNA merger (volumes and spreads), consumer and commercial loan growth, and increases in the benefits from ALM activities including higher portfolio balances (primarily residential mortgages) and the impact of changes in spreads across all product categories. These increases were partially offset by a lower contribution from market-based earning assets and the higher cost associated with higher levels of wholesale funding. The net interest yield on a FTE basis decreased two bps to 2.82 percent in 2006 due primarily to an increase in lower yielding market-based earning assets and loan spreads that continued to tighten due to the flat to inverted yield curve. These decreases were partially offset by widening of spreads on core deposits. Noninterest Income Noninterest income increased $11.6 billion to $38.0 billion in 2006, due primarily to increases in card income of $8.5 billion, trading account profits (losses) of $1.4 billion, equity investment income of $977 million, service charges of $520 million and other income of $1.2 billion partially offset by a decrease in gains (losses) on sales of debt securities of $1.5 billion. Card income increased primarily due to the addition of MBNA resulting in higher excess servicing income, cash advance fees, interchange income and late fees. Trading account profits (losses) increased due to a favorable market environment. Equity investment income increased primarily due to favorable market conditions driven by liquidity in the capital markets as well as a gain of $341 million recorded on the liquidation of a strategic European investment. Service charges grew due to increased non-sufficient funds fees and overdraft charges, account service charges, and ATM fees resulting from new account growth and increased account usage. Other income increased due to the $720 million gain on the sale of our Brazilian operations and the $165 million gain on the sale of our Asia commercial banking business. Gains (losses) on sales of debt securities were $(443) million and $1.1 billion in 2006 and 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a loss on the sale of mortgage-backed securities in 2006 compared to gains recorded in 2005. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $996 million to $5.0 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. Provision expense rose due to increases from the addition of MBNA, reduced benefits from releases of commercial reserves and lower commercial recoveries. These increases were partially offset by lower bankruptcy-related credit costs on the domestic consumer credit card portfolio. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense increased $6.9 billion in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the MBNA merger, increased personnel expense related to higher performance-based compensation and higher marketing expense related to consumer banking initiatives. Amortization of intangibles expense was higher due to increases in purchased credit card relationships, affinity relationships, core deposit intangibles and other intangibles, including trademarks. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $10.8 billion in 2006 compared to $8.0 billion in 2005, resulting in an effective tax rate of 33.9 percent in 2006 and 32.7 percent in 2005. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a $175 million charge to income tax expense arising from the change in tax legislation, the one-time benefit recorded during 2005 related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings and the January 1, 2006 addition of MBNA. Bank of America 2007 71 Table of Contents Business Segment Operations Global Consumer and Small Business Banking Net income increased $4.4 billion, or 62 percent, to $11.4 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. Total revenue rose $16.5 billion, or 58 percent, in 2006 compared to 2005, driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income. The MBNA merger and organic growth in average loans and leases contributed to the $10.6 billion, or 60 percent, increase in net interest income. Increases in card income of $4.9 billion, all other income of $806 million and service charges of $348 million drove the $5.9 billion, or 54 percent, increase in noninterest income. Card income was higher mainly due to increases in interchange income, cash advance fees and late fees due primarily to the impact of the MBNA merger. All other income increased primarily as a result of the MBNA merger. Service charges increased due to new account growth and increased usage. These increases were partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. The provision for credit losses increased $3.8 billion to $8.5 billion in 2006 resulting primarily from an increase in Card Services mainly due to the MBNA merger. Noninterest expense increased $5.6 billion, or 44 percent, primarily driven by the addition of MBNA. Global Corporate and Investment Banking Net income increased $78 million, or one percent, to $6.0 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. Total revenue increased $1.3 billion, or seven percent, in 2006 driven by increases in noninterest income partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income declined $460 million, or four percent, primarily due to the impact of ALM activities and spread compression in the loan portfolio. Noninterest income increased $1.8 billion, or 18 percent, driven by the increase in trading account profits (losses) of $1.2 billion and investment banking income of $585 million mainly due to the continued strength in debt underwriting, sales and trading, and a favorable market environment. These increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense which increased by $1.1 billion, or 11 percent, mainly due to higher personnel expense, including performance-based incentive compensation primarily in CMAS and other general operating costs. Global Wealth and Investment Management Net income increased $211 million, or 10 percent, to $2.2 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. Total revenue increased $483 million, or seven percent, in 2006. Net interest income increased $117 million, or three percent, due to an increase in deposit spreads and higher average loans and leases, largely offset by a decline in ALM activities and loan spread compression. GWIM also benefited from the migration of deposits from GCSBB . For 2006 and 2005 a total of $10.7 billion and $16.9 billion of net deposits were migrated from GCSBB to GWIM . Noninterest income increased $366 million, or 11 percent, mainly due to increases in investment and brokerage services driven by higher levels of AUM. These changes were offset by higher noninterest expense which increased $126 million, or three percent, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expense driven by the addition of sales associates and revenue-related expenses. All Other Net income increased $23 million, or two percent, to $1.5 billion in 2006 compared to 2005. Excluding the securitization offset, total revenue rose $441 million to $3.7 billion, primarily driven by increases in net interest income of $1.1 billion, equity investment income of $839 million and all other income of $861 million partially offset by lower gains (losses) on sales of debt securities. The increase in net interest income was mainly due to the negative impact to 2005 results retained in All Other relating to funds transfer pricing that was not allocated to the businesses. The increase in equity investment income was due to favorable market conditions driving liquidity in the Principal Investing portfolio combined with a gain recorded on the liquidation of a strategic European investment. The increase in all other income was primarily related to the gain on the sale of our Brazilian operations of $720 million. Gains (losses) on sales of debt securities decreased $1.4 billion to $(475) million resulting from a loss on the sale of mortgage-backed securities compared with gains recorded on the sales of mortgage-backed securities in 2005. Merger and restructuring charges increased $393 million due to the MBNA merger whereas the 2005 charges primarily related to the FleetBoston Financial Corporation merger. 72 Bank of America 2007 Table of Contents Statistical Tables Table I Year-to-date Average Balances and Interest Rates FTE Basis 2007 2006 (1) 2005 (Dollars in millions) Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Average Balance Interest Income/ Expense Yield/ Rate Earning assets Time deposits placed and other short-term investments $ 13,152 $ 627 4.77 % $ 15,611 $ 646 4.14 % $ 14,286 $ 472 3.30 % Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 155,828 7,722 4.96 175,334 7,823 4.46 169,132 5,012 2.96 Trading account assets 187,287 9,747 5.20 145,321 7,552 5.20 133,502 5,883 4.41 Debt securities (2) 186,466 10,020 5.37 225,219 11,845 5.26 219,843 11,047 5.03 Loans and leases (3) : Residential mortgage 264,650 15,112 5.71 207,879 11,608 5.58 173,773 9,424 5.42 Credit card domestic 57,883 7,225 12.48 63,838 8,638 13.53 53,997 6,253 11.58 Credit card foreign 12,359 1,502 12.15 9,141 1,147 12.55 Home equity (4) 98,765 7,385 7.48 78,318 5,773 7.37 63,852 3,931 6.16 Direct/Indirect consumer (5) 70,260 6,002 8.54 53,371 4,185 7.84 37,472 2,072 5.53 Other consumer (6) 4,259 389 9.14 7,317 788 10.78 6,854 665 9.72 Total consumer 508,176 37,615 7.40 419,864 32,139 7.65 335,948 22,345 6.65 Commercial domestic 180,102 12,884 7.15 151,231 10,897 7.21 128,034 8,266 6.46 Commercial real estate (7) 42,950 3,145 7.32 36,939 2,740 7.42 34,304 2,046 5.97 Commercial lease financing 20,435 1,212 5.93 20,862 995 4.77 20,441 992 4.85 Commercial foreign 24,491 1,452 5.93 23,521 1,674 7.12 18,491 1,292 6.99 Total commercial 267,978 18,693 6.98 232,553 16,306 7.01 201,270 12,596 6.26 Total loans and leases 776,154 56,308 7.25 652,417 48,445 7.43 537,218 34,941 6.50 Other earning assets 71,305 4,629 6.49 55,242 3,498 6.33 38,013 2,103 5.53 Total earning assets (8) 1,390,192 89,053 6.41 1,269,144 79,809 6.29 1,111,994 59,458 5.35 Cash and cash equivalents 33,091 34,052 33,199 Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses 178,790 163,485 124,699 Total assets $ 1,602,073 $ 1,466,681 $ 1,269,892 Interest-bearing liabilities Domestic interest-bearing deposits: Savings $ 32,316 $ 188 0.58 % $ 34,608 $ 269 0.78 % $ 36,602 $ 211 0.58 % NOW and money market deposit accounts 220,207 4,361 1.98 218,077 3,923 1.80 227,722 2,839 1.25 Consumer CDs and IRAs 167,801 7,817 4.66 144,738 6,022 4.16 124,385 4,091 3.29 Negotiable CDs, public funds and other time deposits 20,557 974 4.74 12,195 483 3.97 6,865 250 3.65 Total domestic interest-bearing deposits 440,881 13,340 3.03 409,618 10,697 2.61 395,574 7,391 1.87 Foreign interest-bearing deposits: Banks located in foreign countries 42,788 2,174 5.08 34,985 1,982 5.67 22,945 1,202 5.24 Governments and official institutions 16,523 812 4.91 12,674 586 4.63 7,418 238 3.21 Time, savings and other 43,443 1,767 4.07 38,544 1,215 3.15 31,603 661 2.09 Total foreign interest-bearing deposits 102,754 4,753 4.63 86,203 3,783 4.39 61,966 2,101 3.39 Total interest-bearing deposits 543,635 18,093 3.33 495,821 14,480 2.92 457,540 9,492 2.08 Federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings 424,814 21,975 5.17 411,132 19,840 4.83 326,408 11,615 3.56 Trading account liabilities 82,721 3,444 4.16 64,689 2,640 4.08 57,689 2,364 4.10 Long-term debt 169,855 9,359 5.51 130,124 7,034 5.41 97,709 4,418 4.52 Total interest-bearing liabilities (8) 1,221,025 52,871 4.33 1,101,766 43,994 3.99 939,346 27,889 2.97 Noninterest-bearing sources: Noninterest-bearing deposits 173,547 177,174 174,892 Other liabilities 70,839 57,278 55,793 Shareholders equity 136,662 130,463 99,861 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 1,602,073 $ 1,466,681 $ 1,269,892 Net interest spread 2.08 % 2.30 % 2.38 % Impact of noninterest-bearing sources 0.52 0.52 0.46 Net interest income/yield on earning assets $ 36,182 2.60 % $ 35,815 2.82 % $ 31,569 2.84 % (1) Interest income (FTE basis) in 2006 does not include the cumulative tax charge resulting from a change in tax legislation relating to extraterritorial tax income and foreign sales corporation regimes.

Management has excluded this one-time impact to provide a more comparative basis of presentation for net interest income and net interest yield on earning assets on a FTE basis. The impact on any given future period is not expected to be material. (2) Yields on AFS debt securities are calculated based on fair value rather than historical cost balances. The use of fair value does not have a material impact on net interest yield. (3) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances. Income on these nonperforming loans is recognized on a cash basis. (4) Includes home equity loans of $16.7 billion, $9.7 billion and $7.6 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(7) Includes domestic commercial real estate loans of $42.1 billion, $36.2 billion and $33.8 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (8) Interest income includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which increased (decreased) interest income on the underlying assets $(542) million, $(372) million and $704 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest expense includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which increased interest expense on the underlying liabilities $813 million, $106 million and $1.3 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of Global Wealth and Investment Management which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets market value. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net-worth and retail clients and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. Bridge Loan A loan or security which is expected to be replaced by permanent financing (debt or equity securities, loan syndication or asset sales) prior to the maturity date of the loan. Bridge loans may include an unfunded commitment, as well as funded amounts, and are generally expected to be retired in one year or less. CDOs-Squared A type of CDO where the underlying collateralizing securities include tranches of other CDOs. Client Brokerage Assets Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Committed Credit Exposure Committed credit exposure includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the Corporation is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Core Net Interest Income Managed Basis Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis excluding the impact of market-based activities and certain securitizations. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) A derivative contract that provides protection against the deterioration of credit quality and would allow one party to receive payment in the event of default by a third party under a borrowing arrangement. Derivative A contract or agreement whose value is derived from changes in an underlying index such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or prices of securities. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, financial futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts. Excess Servicing Income For certain assets that have been securitized, interest income, fee revenue and recoveries in excess of interest paid to the investors, gross credit losses and other trust expenses related to the securitized receivables are all reclassified into excess servicing income, which is a component of card income. Excess servicing income also includes the changes in fair value of the Corporation card related retained interests. Interest-only (IO) Strip A residual interest in a securitization trust representing the right to receive future net cash flows from securitized assets after payments to third party investors and net credit losses. These arise when assets are transferred to a special purpose entity as part of an asset securitization transaction qualifying for sale treatment under GAAP. Letter of Credit A document issued by the Corporation on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay that third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the Corporation credit for that of the Corporation customer. Managed Basis Managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold (i.e., held loans) are presented. Noninterest income, both on a held and managed basis, also includes the impact of adjustments to the interest-only strip that are recorded in card income. Managed Net Losses Represents net charge-offs on held loans combined with realized credit losses associated with the securitized loan portfolio. Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Operating Basis A basis of presentation not defined by GAAP that excludes merger and restructuring charges. Qualified Special Purpose Entity (QSPE) A special purpose entity whose activities are strictly limited to holding and servicing financial assets and meet the requirements set forth in SFAS 140. A qualified special purpose entity is generally not required to be consolidated by any party. Return on Average Common Shareholders Equity (ROE) Measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders equity allocated to that unit. Return on Average Tangible Shareholders Equity (ROTE) Measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders equity allocated to that unit reduced by allocated goodwill. Securitize / Securitization A process by which financial assets are sold to a special purpose entity, which then issues securities collateralized by those underlying assets, and the return on the securities issued is based on the principal and interest cash flow of the underlying assets. Structured Investment Vehicle (SIV) An entity that issues short duration debt and uses the proceeds from the issuance to purchase longer-term fixed income securities. Unrecognized Tax Benefit (UTB) The difference between the benefit recognized for a tax position in accordance with FIN 48, which is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon settlement, and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return. Value-at-Risk (VAR) A VAR model estimates a range of hypothetical scenarios to calculate a potential loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level. VAR is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk. Variable Interest Entities (VIE) A term defined by FIN 46R for an entity whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest. The entity may not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from third parties. The equity investors may lack the ability to make significant decisions about the entity activities, or they may not absorb the losses or receive the residual returns generated by the assets and other contractual arrangements of the VIE. The entity that will absorb a majority of expected variability (the sum of the absolute values of the expected losses and expected residual returns) consolidates the VIE and is referred to as the primary beneficiary.
