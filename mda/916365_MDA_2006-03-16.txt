ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States, focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. The Company offers the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: (1) equine, pet and animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; (2) maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; (3) hardware and tool products; (4) seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment; (5) truck, trailer and towing products; and (6) work clothing for the entire family. The Company's stores currently range in size from approximately 7,000 to 23,000 square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space. Currently, the Company is developing stores utilizing one of five standard prototypes and also utilizes existing store structures. The Company's new stores typically range in size from 15,500 square feet of inside selling space to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space. The Company operated 595 retail farm and ranch stores as of December 31, 2005. On November 10, 2005, the Company acquired the assets of privately-held Del's Farm Supply, Inc. ("Del's") for $17.6 million and the assumption of certain liabilities. Based in Lakewood, Washington, Del's operates 16 stores, primarily in the Pacific Northwest, that offer a wide selection of products (primarily in the equine, pet and animal category) tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del's stores currently range in size from approximately 1,500 to 7,000 square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space. The fiscal year of the Company includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 contains 53 weeks and each of the fiscal years ended December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 contain 52 weeks. The Company's current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through aggressive merchandising and marketing programs with an "everyday low prices" philosophy, supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through selective assortment, vendor price negotiation, sourcing and optimization of transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising and distribution, and (5) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth. The Company has experienced considerable growth over the last five years, with an annual compounded unit growth rate of approximately 14%. This growth has expanded the Company's market presence into 37 states. The Company plans to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in its unit count of approximately 13%. The Company believes the projected unit count increase, along with strategic relocations of stores into areas of greater retail opportunity, will contribute substantially to the Company's future growth. The acquisition of Del's enabled the Company to establish an initial presence in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in Washington, with one store in British Columbia, Canada. The Company operated 595 retail farm and ranch stores as of December 31, 2005 and has plans to open approximately 78 to 80 stores in fiscal 2006, and approximately 19 store relocations. The Company has developed a proven method for selecting store sites and has identified over 800 potential additional markets for new stores in the United States. In addition, the Company continues to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores. The Company plans to relocate additional stores over the next several years. Store relocations are typically undertaken to move small, older stores to full-size formats in improved retail areas. The Company has relocated 72 stores since 2001. The Company has placed significant emphasis on its merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of its products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. These efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of store employees, have enhanced sales and financial performance. 15 <PAGE> SEASONALITY AND WEATHER The Company's business is highly seasonal. Historically, the Company's sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. The Company typically operates at approximately break even in the first fiscal quarter of each year. Unseasonable weather, excessive rain, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect the Company's sales. The Company believes, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores. The Company experiences its highest inventory and accounts payable levels during its first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during its third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season. INFLATION Although the Company cannot accurately determine the full effect of inflation on its operations, it believes its sales and results of operations have been affected by inflation. The Company is subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. Moreover, in the last few years, energy prices have risen dramatically, which has resulted in increased fuel costs for the Company's business and utility costs for the Company's stores. The Company has been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation, principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation on the Company in the future. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial position and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company's significant accounting policies, including areas of critical management judgments and estimates, have primary impact on the following financial statement areas: - Inventory valuation - Self insurance - Sales returns - Sales tax reserve The Company's critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties, which affect the application of such policies. (See Note 1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for a discussion of the Company's critical accounting policies.) The Company's financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. 16 <PAGE> QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA The Company's unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2005 and 2004 are shown below (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): <TABLE> <CAPTION> FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2005 QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER* TOTAL - ---- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Net sales......................... $ 377,203 $ 613,235 $ 479,607 $ 597,934 $ 2,067,979 Gross margin...................... 112,071 189,756 146,905 190,819 639,551 Income from operations............ 1,750 56,308 28,939 49,447 136,444 Net income........................ 684 35,754 18,329 30,902 85,669 Net income per share: Basic........................... $ 0.02 $ 0.92 $ 0.47 $ 0.78 $ 2.19 Diluted......................... $ 0.02 $ 0.87 $ 0.45 $ 0.75 $ 2.09 Same-store sales increase......... 4.2% 5.9% 1.8% 10.0% 5.7% FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2004 QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER* TOTAL - ---- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----------- Net sales......................... $ 330,554 $ 525,919 $ 426,384 $ 455,986 $ 1,738,843 Gross margin...................... 99,169 160,543 119,576 145,399 524,687 Income from operations............ 5,887 49,241 12,128 34,290 101,546 Net income........................ 3,445 31,004 7,612 22,008 64,069 Net income per share: Basic........................... $ 0.09 $ 0.81 $ 0.20 $ 0.58 $ 1.68 Diluted......................... $ 0.08 $ 0.76 $ 0.19 $ 0.54 $ 1.57 Same-store sales increase......... 12.4% 10.0% 10.1% 7.7% 9.9% </TABLE> - ------------------------------------ * The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is comprised of 14 weeks while all other quarters presented for both years are comprised of 13 weeks. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in the Company's consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2005 2004 2003 ---- ---- ---- Net sales................................. 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of merchandise sold.................. 69.1 69.8 69.5 -------- -------- -------- Gross margin.............................. 30.9 30.2 30.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses................................ 22.7 22.8 22.5 Depreciation and amortization............. 1.6 1.6 1.5 -------- -------- -------- Income from operations.................... 6.6 5.8 6.5 Interest expense, net..................... 0.1 0.1 0.2 -------- -------- -------- Income before income taxes................ 6.5 5.7 6.3 Income tax provision...................... 2.4 2.0 2.4 -------- -------- -------- Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change....................... 4.1 3.7 3.9 Cumulative effect of accounting change.... -- -- 0.1 -------- -------- -------- Net income................................ 4.1% 3.7% 3.8% ======== ======== ======== 17 <PAGE> FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Net sales increased 18.9% to $2,068.0 million in fiscal 2005 from $1,738.8 million in fiscal 2004. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores (including 16 additional stores from the acquisition of Del's Farm Supply) as well as a same-store sales improvement of 5.7%. Fiscal 2005 included an additional week compared to last year, which accounted for approximately 1.8% of the sales increase. The Company's total average transaction value increased 5.5% to $42.03 for the twelve months ended fiscal 2005 while average daily transactions decreased to 245 compared to 248 in the prior year, while same-store sales transactions increased 1.4%. The same-store sales increase includes an approximate 1.2% gain for fiscal year 2005 which is attributed to increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel and petroleum-related product costs. Same-store sales increases were generally experienced across all product lines, with seasonal products representing the strongest category. In fiscal 2005, the Company opened 65 new stores (compared to 53 in the prior year), acquired an additional 16 stores from the acquisition of Del's, relocated 18 stores (compared to 20 in the prior year) and closed one store (compared to one in the prior year). As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 76 basis points to 30.9% for fiscal 2005 from 30.2% for fiscal 2004. Gross margin was primarily impacted by overall lower product costs partially offset by higher than anticipated transportation costs (caused primarily by increased diesel fuel costs and overall capacity demands on the transportation industry). As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were comparable at 22.7% and 22.8% for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 25.1% in fiscal 2005 over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores, remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities. Net interest expense increased 13.3% in fiscal 2005 from the prior year. This increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in the current year partially offset by a reduction in average long-term borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement. The Company's effective tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2005 compared to 36.0% in the prior year, resulting primarily from a higher effective state income tax rate due to the mix of business by state. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2005 increased 33.7% to $85.7 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared to net income of $64.1 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the prior year. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 Net sales increased 18.1% to $1,738.8 million in fiscal 2004 from $1,472.9 million in fiscal 2003. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 9.9%. The Company's favorable performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of 53 new stores, market share gains in certain markets, continued improvement in merchandising programs and successful implementation of new initiatives in presentation, purchasing and product selection. Same-store sales increases were generally experienced across all product lines, with equine, pet and animal products representing the strongest category. The Company's average transaction value increased 4.7% to $39.83 for the twelve months ended fiscal 2004. Increased average transaction counts also contributed to the increase in same-store sales. The same-store sales increase included an approximate 2.6% gain for fiscal year 2004 which was attributable to increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel, grain and petroleum-related product costs. In fiscal 2004, the Company opened 53 new stores (compared to 31 in the prior year), relocated 20 stores (compared to 18 in the prior year) and closed one store (compared to one in the prior year). As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 30.2% for fiscal 2004 from 30.5% for fiscal 2003. Gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by higher than anticipated freight costs (caused primarily by 18 <PAGE> increased diesel fuel costs and demand in the transportation industry) and absorption of some of the impact of higher steel and other commodity costs. The impact of cost increases was partially recovered through higher selling prices. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 22.8% and 22.5% for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The loss in SG&A leverage was due primarily to approximately $3.2 million in expenses incurred for the consolidation and relocation of the Company's Store Support Center. Additionally, new store openings fell behind schedule during the middle of the year, negatively impacting expense leverage. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 25.9% in fiscal 2004 over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores, remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities. Net interest expense decreased 58.2% in fiscal 2004 from the prior year. This decrease reflected stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store openings, which resulted in reduced average long-term borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement. The Company's effective tax rate was 36.0% for fiscal 2004 compared to 37.6% in the prior year, resulting primarily from a lower effective state income tax rate due to the mix of business by state. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2004 increased 15.1% to $64.1 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to net income of $55.7 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, in the prior year. Exclusive of the cumulative effect of the change in 2003 in the Company's method of accounting for consideration received from vendors, net income for fiscal 2003 was $57.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share. The increase in net income for fiscal 2004 is primarily a result of the factors discussed above and leveraging operating costs with increased sales. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No. 02-16 ("EITF 02-16"), "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor's products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor's products. The EITF concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold. Prior to adopting this pronouncement, the Company classified all vendor-provided marketing support funds as a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. The effect of applying EITF 02-16 on prior-period financial statements would have resulted in a change to previously reported net income; thus the Company has reported the adoption of EITF 02-16 as a cumulative effect adjustment. Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of $3.1 million ($1.9 million net of income taxes) for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company's primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. The Company's primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations, commitments available under its revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. The Company's inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively. 19 <PAGE> WORKING CAPITAL At December 31, 2005, the Company had working capital of $240.7 million, a $21.3 million increase from December 25, 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2005 2004 VARIANCE ------------ ------------ ------------ <S> <C> <C> <C> CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents.................... $ 21.2 $ 28.9 $ (7.7) Inventories.................................. 460.8 385.1 75.7 Prepaid expenses and other current assets.... 38.4 32.8 5.6 Other, net................................... 11.0 11.6 (0.6) ------------ ------------ ------------ 531.4 458.4 73.0 ------------ ------------ ------------ CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable............................. $ 185.4 $ 147.9 $ 37.5 Accrued expenses............................. 102.8 90.2 12.6 Other, net................................... 2.5 0.9 1.6 ------------ ------------ ------------ 290.7 239.0 51.7 ------------ ------------ ------------ WORKING CAPITAL................................ $ 240.7 $ 219.4 $ 21.3 ============ ============ ============ </TABLE> The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to payments on outstanding borrowings. The increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from additional inventory for new stores (including preparation of stores to open in the subsequent year) and an increase in average inventory per store due to an expected increase in sales. Trade credit arises from the Company's vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment terms vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the product and vendor. The increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accrued expenses was generally due to the increase in the number of stores in operation and resulting increases in sales, growth in operations, and timing of payments. BORROWINGS AND CREDIT FACILITIES In August 2002, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the "Credit Agreement"), whereby the Company is permitted to borrow up to $155 million. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on January 28, 2004 and September 30, 2004. Both amendments included changes to certain financial covenants, primarily to provide flexibility for capital expenditures, and extended the maturity to February 27, 2008. The outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement totaled $8.2 million at December 31, 2005 and $32.3 million at December 25, 2004. The balance of funds available under the Credit Agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up to $50 million for letters of credit, of which $12.1 million and $12.7 million were outstanding at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively. These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank's base rate (7.25% at December 31, 2005) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") (4.39% at December 31, 2005) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.75% to 1.5% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on Company performance (0.75% at December 31, 2005). The Company is also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% per annum (0.20% at December 31, 2005) and adjusted quarterly based on Company performance, on the average daily unused portion of the credit line. There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. In addition, the Company must comply with certain quarterly restrictions (based on a rolling four-quarters basis) regarding net worth, leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage, current ratio requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005. 20 <PAGE> SOURCES AND USES OF CASH The Company's primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing and financing activities are capital expenditures and payments on debt, respectively. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2005 2004 2003 ------------ ------------ ------------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Net cash provided by operating activities..................... $ 99.2 $ 77.1 $ 63.9 Net cash used in investing activities.........................

Increases in the cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets and a relative decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the growth in the Company's business during the year and the timing of payments. The $13.2 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2004 2003 VARIANCE ------------ ------------ ------------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Net income................................................... $ 64.1 $ 55.7 $ 8.4 Depreciation and amortization................................ 27.2 21.6 5.6 Deferred income taxes........................................

Increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses also contributed to the growth in cash provided by operations. These increases were primarily due to the growth in the Company's business during fiscal 2004 and the timing of payments. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Investing activities used $90.7 million, $87.3 million, and $43.4 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to the Company's capital expenditures and in fiscal 2005, to the acquisition of the assets of Del's Farm Supply in 2005. 21 <PAGE> The Company's significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, required the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2005 2004 2003 ------------ ------------ ------------ <S> <C> <C> <C> New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened............ $ 40,525 $ 30,758 $ 18,990 Existing stores............................................... 13,936 10,033 9,829 Distribution center capacity and improvements................. 19,585 41,024 17,217 Information technology........................................ 4,100 9,105 3,320 Corporate and other........................................... 689 2,069 626 ------------ ------------ ------------ $ 78,835 $ 92,989 $ 49,982 ============ ============ ============ </TABLE> The Company's long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people. The costs reflected are typically building improvements as the Company leases the majority of its facilities. The Company currently estimates that capital expenditures will be approximately $80.0 million in fiscal 2006, as follows (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2006 ------------ <S> <C> New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened............ $ 52,700 Existing store improvements................................... 20,400 Distribution center capacity and improvements................. 2,500 Information technology........................................ 3,300 Corporate and other........................................... 1,100 ------------ $ 80,000 ============ </TABLE> FINANCING ACTIVITIES Financing activities used $16.2 million, provided $19.2 million, and used $14.3 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, largely as a result of borrowing requirements created by operations, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs. The Company believes that its cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations and its capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years. SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table reflects the Company's future obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL CONTRACTUAL LESS THAN MORE THAN OBLIGATIONS 1 YEAR 1-3 YEARS 4-5 YEARS 5 YEARS ----------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Long term debt (a)........ $ 8,212 $ -- $ 8,212 $ -- $ -- Operating leases.......... 761,419 83,258 153,575 134,665 389,921 Capital leases (b)........ 5,676 1,223 1,383 413 2,657 Purchase obligations (c).. 448 344 104 -- -- ----------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ $ 775,755 $ 84,825 $ 163,274 $ 135,078 $ 392,578 =========== ============ ============ ============ ============ </TABLE> (a) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. At December 31, 2005, this entire amount relates to the Company's Credit Agreement. (b) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (c) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for data transfer for information technology use. The Company had outstanding standby letters of credit of $12.1 million as of December 31, 2005. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The extent of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements is operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. Leasing buildings and equipment for retail stores and offices 22 <PAGE> rather than acquiring these significant assets allows the Company to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow the Company to purchase inventory in a timely manner. KNOWN TRENDS, EVENTS, DEMANDS, COMMITMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES LITIGATION The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, management expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. Any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings. As previously disclosed, in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 filed on March 10, 2005 (which Annual Report was amended by the filing of Amendment No. 1 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A on April 21, 2005), in July 2004, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee by the Hawaii Laborers Pension Plan against each of the Company's directors, certain of its officers and one former director. The Company was named as a nominal defendant. On September 17, 2004, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On October 8, 2004, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to make a pre-suit demand on the Board of Directors. On December 3, 2004, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice. On February 17, 2005, the Court entered an order denying a motion by the plaintiff to alter or amend the December 3, 2004 order and judgment dismissing the amended complaint. On March 18, 2005, the plaintiff appealed the order to the Tennessee Court of Appeals. On October 3, 2005, plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and on October 19, 2005, the Tennessee Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal. SALES TAX COMPLIANCE A portion of the Company's sales are with tax-exempt customers. The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt transaction. Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will audit the Company to verify its compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of the Company's customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex environment of compliance. These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the propriety of its sales tax compliance. While the Company believes it reasonably enforces sales tax compliance with its customers and endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. Management believes it has adequately provided for such liability based on known assessments and expected settlements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS STOCK OPTIONS In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. The Company has adopted SFAS 123R in fiscal 2006, as required. SFAS 123R permits the use of either a "modified prospective" method, or a "modified retrospective" method. Under the "modified prospective" method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. Under the "modified retrospective" method, the requirements are the same as under the "modified prospective" method, but also permit the restatement of prior period financial statements based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS 123. 23 <PAGE> The Company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model (i.e. BLACK-SCHOLES) to measure the fair value of stock options granted to Employees. While SFAS 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial, or "lattice" model. Based upon research done by the Company on the alternative models available to value option grants, and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future, the Company has determined that it will continue to use a modified BLACK-SCHOLES model for option valuation. SFAS 123R includes several modifications to the presentation of income taxes in the financial statements. The expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place, which could cause variability in the Company's effective tax rates recorded throughout the year. SFAS 123R does not allow companies to "predict" when these taxable events will take place. Furthermore, it requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. The income tax impact is uncertain and cannot be estimated, because it will depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options. The amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions, as shown in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, were $12.5 million, $8.7 million, and $4.3 million, respectively, for 2005, 2004, and 2003. The Company will utilize the "modified prospective" method. The Company expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006 will reduce fiscal 2006 net earnings by approximately $7.0 million ($4.4 million after tax). See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's stock-based compensation plans. INVENTORY COSTS In November of 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). The purpose of this statement is to clarify the accounting of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and waste material. ARB No. 43 stated that under some circumstances these costs may be so abnormal that they are required to be treated as current period costs. SFAS 151 requires that these costs be treated as current period costs regardless if they meet the criteria of "so abnormal." The provisions of SFAS 151 shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Adoption of SFAS 151 on January 1, 2006 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. EXCHANGE OF NONMONETARY ASSETS In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29" ("SFAS 153"). SFAS 153 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 was effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning with the third quarter of 2005, with earlier application permitted. Adoption of SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.
