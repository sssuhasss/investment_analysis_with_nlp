Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes the city of Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states. Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. Business Segments In this Management Discussion, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2009 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving approximately 2.1 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately 5.7 million people and includes the city of Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout CenterPoint Houston certificated service territory. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (Texas Utility Commission). Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. 38 Table of Contents Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated retail and wholesale natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in 18 states in the central and eastern regions of the United States. Interstate Pipelines CERC interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 8,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59 Bcf. It also owns a 10% interest in an 80 Bcf Bistineau storage facility located in Bienville Parish, Louisiana, with the remaining interest owned and operated by Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. Field Services CERC field services business owns and operates approximately 3,700 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas from approximately 140 separate systems located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Other Operations Our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Factors Influencing Our Business We are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the gathering, processing, transportation and sale of natural gas and the transportation and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries. We do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end-use electric customers. To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our five business segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, operation and maintenance expense, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. We also monitor system reliability, safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance. To the extent the adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. Reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Performance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer. Weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage, and we compare our results to weather on an adjusted basis. During 2009, we continued to see evidence that customers are seeking to conserve in their energy consumption, particularly during periods of high energy prices or in times of economic distress. That conservation can have adverse effects on our results. In many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and in Minnesota, we have benefited from customer growth that tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption. We anticipate that this growth will continue despite recent economic downturns, though that growth may be lower than we have recently experienced in these areas. In addition, the profitability of these businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates. In our recent Gas Operations rate filings, we have sought rate mechanisms that help to decouple our results from the impacts of 39 Table of Contents weather and conservation, but such rate mechanisms have not yet been approved in all jurisdictions. We plan to continue to pursue such decoupling mechanisms in our rate filings. Our Field Services and Interstate Pipelines business segments are currently benefiting from their proximity to new natural gas producing regions in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Our Interstate Pipelines business segment benefited from new projects placed into service in 2009 on our Carthage to Perryville line. In our Field Services business segment, strong drilling activity in the new shale producing regions has helped offset declines in drilling activity in traditional producing regions due to the effects of the economic downturn and significantly lower commodity prices in 2009. In monitoring performance of the segments, we focus on throughput of the pipelines and gathering systems, and in the case of Field Services, on well-connects. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis. Its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the United States. The segment benefits from favorable price differentials, either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis. While it utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements, it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level or VaR to avoid significant financial exposures. Lower commodity prices and low price differentials during 2009 adversely affected results for this business segment. The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. Our goal is to improve our credit ratings over time. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the financial markets, such as occurred in the last half of 2008 and continued during 2009, can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. For example, we have negotiated amendments to the financial covenant in our revolving credit facility to better ensure that adequate debt capacity would be available if needed to finance restoration costs following major storms. We expect to experience higher borrowing costs and greater uncertainty in executing capital markets transactions given the current uncertainties in the financial markets. As it did with many businesses, the sharp decline in stock market values during the latter part of 2008 had a significant adverse impact on the value of our pension plan assets. While that impact did not require us to make additional contributions to the pension plan, it significantly increased the pension expense we recognized during 2009 and expect to recognize in 2010 for all our business segments, other than our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, and we may need to make significant cash contributions to our pension plan subsequent to 2010. Consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs, we will defer until our next rate proceeding before the Texas Utility Commission the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our 2007 base rates for our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. Significant Events Hurricane Ike CenterPoint Houston electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result of Hurricane Ike, which struck the upper Texas coast in September 2008. As is common with electric utilities serving coastal regions, the poles, towers, wires, street lights and pole mounted equipment that comprise CenterPoint Houston transmission and distribution system are not covered by property insurance, but office buildings and warehouses and their contents and substations are covered by insurance that provides for a maximum deductible of $10 million. Current estimates are that total losses to property covered by this insurance were approximately $30 million. 40 Table of Contents CenterPoint Houston deferred the uninsured system restoration costs as management believed it was probable that such costs would be recovered through the regulatory process. As a result, system restoration costs did not affect CenterPoint Energy or CenterPoint Houston reported operating income for 2008 or 2009. Legislation enacted by the Texas Legislature in April 2009 authorized the Texas Utility Commission to conduct proceedings to determine the amount of system restoration costs and related costs associated with hurricanes or other major storms that utilities are entitled to recover, and to issue financing orders that would permit a utility like CenterPoint Houston to recover the distribution portion of those costs and related carrying costs through the issuance of non-recourse system restoration bonds similar to the securitization bonds issued previously. The legislation also allowed such a utility to recover, or defer for future recovery, the transmission portion of its system restoration costs through the existing mechanisms established to recover transmission costs. Pursuant to such legislation, CenterPoint Houston filed with the Texas Utility Commission an application for review and approval for recovery of approximately $678 million, including approximately $608 million in system restoration costs identified as of the end of February 2009, plus $2 million in regulatory expenses, $13 million in certain debt issuance costs and $55 million in incurred and projected carrying costs calculated through August 2009. In July 2009, CenterPoint Houston announced a settlement agreement with the parties to the proceeding. Under that settlement agreement, CenterPoint Houston was entitled to recover a total of $663 million in costs relating to Hurricane Ike, along with carrying costs from September 1, 2009 until system restoration bonds were issued. The Texas Utility Commission issued an order in August 2009 approving CenterPoint Houston application and the settlement agreement and authorizing recovery of $663 million, of which $643 million was attributable to distribution service and eligible for securitization and the remaining $20 million was attributable to transmission service and eligible for recovery through the existing mechanisms established to recover transmission costs. In July 2009, CenterPoint Houston filed with the Texas Utility Commission its application for a financing order to recover the portion of approved costs related to distribution service through the issuance of system restoration bonds. In August 2009, the Texas Utility Commission issued a financing order allowing CenterPoint Houston to securitize $643 million in distribution service costs plus carrying charges from September 1, 2009 through the date the system restoration bonds were issued, as well as certain up-front qualified costs capped at approximately $6 million. In November 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued approximately $665 million of system restoration bonds through its CenterPoint Energy Restoration Bond Company, LLC subsidiary with interest rates of 1.833% to 4.243% and final maturity dates ranging from February 2016 to August 2023. The bonds will be repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers. In accordance with the financing order, CenterPoint Houston also placed a separate customer credit in effect when the storm restoration bonds were issued. That credit (ADFIT Credit) is applied to customers bills while the bonds are outstanding to reflect the benefit of accumulated deferred federal income taxes (ADFIT) associated with the storm restoration costs (including a carrying charge of 11.075%). The beginning balance of the ADFIT related to storm restoration costs was approximately $207 million and will decline over the life of the system restoration bonds as taxes are paid on the system restoration tariffs. The ADFIT Credit will reduce operating income in 2010 by approximately $24 million. In accordance with the orders discussed above, as of December 31, 2009, CenterPoint Houston has recorded $651 million associated with distribution-related storm restoration costs as a net regulatory asset and $20 million associated with transmission-related storm restoration costs, of which $18 million is recorded in property, plant and equipment and $2 million of related carrying costs is recorded in regulatory assets. These amounts reflect carrying costs of $60 million related to distribution and $2 million related to transmission through December 31, 2009, based on the 11.075% cost of capital approved by the Texas Utility Commission. The carrying costs have been bifurcated into two components: (i) return of borrowing costs and (ii) an allowance for earnings on shareholders investment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the component representing a return of borrowing costs of $23 million has been recognized and is included in other income in our Statements of Consolidated Income. The component representing an allowance for earnings on shareholders investment of $39 million is being deferred and will be recognized as it is collected through rates. 41 Table of Contents Gas Operations also suffered some damage to its system in Houston, Texas and in other portions of its service territory across Texas and Louisiana. As of December 31, 2009, Gas Operations has deferred approximately $3 million of costs related to Hurricane Ike for recovery as part of future natural gas distribution rate proceedings. Long-Term Gas Gathering and Treatment Agreements In September 2009, CenterPoint Energy Field Services, Inc. (CEFS), a wholly-owned natural gas gathering and treating subsidiary of CERC Corp., entered into long-term agreements with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of EnCana Corporation (EnCana) and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale formations in Louisiana. CEFS also acquired jointly-owned gathering facilities from EnCana and Shell in De Soto and Red River parishes in northwest Louisiana. Each of the agreements includes acreage dedication and volume commitments for which CEFS has rights to gather Shell and EnCana natural gas production from the dedicated areas. In connection with the agreements, CEFS commenced gathering and treating services utilizing the acquired facilities. CEFS is expanding the acquired facilities in order to gather and treat up to 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of natural gas. If EnCana or Shell elect, CEFS will further expand the facilities in order to gather and treat additional future volumes. The construction necessary to reach the contractual capacity of 700 MMcf per day includes more than 200 miles of gathering lines, nearly 25,500 horsepower of compression and over 800 MMcf per day of treating capacity. CEFS estimates that the purchase of existing facilities and construction to gather 700 MMcf per day will cost up to $325 million. If EnCana and Shell elect expansion of the project to gather and process additional future volumes of up to 1 Bcf per day, CEFS estimates that the expansion would cost as much as an additional $300 million and EnCana and Shell would provide incremental volume commitments. Funds for construction are being provided from anticipated cash flows from operations, lines of credit or proceeds from the sale of debt or equity securities. As of December 31, 2009, $176 million had been spent on the project, including the purchase of existing facilities. Debt Financing Transactions In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds due in March 2014 with an interest rate of 7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under CenterPoint Houston revolving credit facility and the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ike. In August 2009, Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH) closed on a private debt offering in the amount of $375 million. Also during 2009, CERC Corp. made a capital contribution to SESH in the amount of $137 million. Using $186 million of its proceeds from the debt offering and the capital contribution, SESH repaid the note receivable it owed to CERC Corp., which note had a principal balance of $323 million at the time of the repayment. CERC Corp. used the proceeds to repay borrowings under its credit facility. In October 2009, CenterPoint Houston terminated its $600 million 364-day secured credit facility which had been arranged in November 2008 following Hurricane Ike. In October 2009, the size of CERC Corp. revolving credit facility was reduced from $950 million to $915 million through removal of Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman) as a lender. Prior to its removal, Lehman had a $35 million commitment to lend. All credit facility loans to CERC Corp. that were funded by Lehman were repaid in September 2009. In October 2009, CERC amended its receivables facility to extend the termination date to October 8, 2010. Availability under CERC 364-day receivables facility ranges from $150 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. In January 2010, we purchased $290 million principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. 42 Table of Contents Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 5.125%. The purchase reduces temporary investments and leverage while providing us with the flexibility to finance future capital needs in the tax-exempt market through a remarketing of these bonds. In January 2010, CERC Corp. redeemed $45 million of its outstanding 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Equity Financing Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received net proceeds of approximately $280 million from the issuance of 24.2 million common shares in an underwritten public offering, net proceeds of $148 million from the issuance of 14.3 million common shares through a continuous offering program, proceeds of approximately $57 million from the sale of approximately 4.9 million common shares to our defined contribution plan and proceeds of approximately $15 million from the sale of approximately 1.3 million common shares to participants in our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. Asset Management Agreements In 2009, Gas Operations entered into various asset management agreements associated with its utility distribution service in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. Generally, these asset management agreements are contracts between Gas Operations and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, Gas Operations agreed to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for Gas Operations and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for Gas Operations. Gas Operations is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part on the results of the asset optimization. Gas Operations has received approval from the state regulatory commissions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma to retain a share of the asset management agreement proceeds, although the percentage of payments to be retained by Gas Operations varies based on the jurisdiction, with the majority of the payments to benefit customers. The agreements have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2016. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: the resolution of the true-up proceedings, including, in particular, the results of appeals to the Texas Supreme Court regarding rulings obtained to date; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments, including deregulation, re-regulation, health care reform, and changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to the various aspects of our business; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions, developments or regulations relating to the environment, including those related to global climate change; timely and appropriate legislative and regulatory actions allowing securitization or other recovery of costs associated with any future hurricanes or natural disasters; timely and appropriate rate actions and increases, allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; cost overruns on major capital projects that cannot be recouped in prices; industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; 43 Table of Contents the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas and natural gas liquids; the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas, including supplies available for gathering by our field services business; the timing and extent of changes in natural gas basis differentials; weather variations and other natural phenomena; changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; actions by rating agencies; effectiveness of our risk management activities; inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers; the ability of RRI Energy, Inc. (RRI) (formerly known as Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc.) and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations to us, including indemnity obligations, or in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor; the ability of REPs that are subsidiaries of NRG Retail LLC and TXU Energy Retail Company LLC (TXU Energy), which are CenterPoint Houston two largest customers, to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries; the outcome of litigation brought by or against us; our ability to control costs; the investment performance of our pension and postretirement benefit plans; our potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which we cannot assure will be completed or will have the anticipated benefits to us; acquisition and merger activities involving us or our competitors; and other factors we discuss under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 44 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Revenues $ 9,623 $ 11,322 $ 8,281 Expenses 8,438 10,049 7,157 Operating Income 1,185 1,273 1,124 Gain (Loss) on Marketable Securities (114 ) (139 ) 82 Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities 111 128 (68 ) Interest and Other Finance Charges (509 ) (468 ) (513 ) Interest on Transition and System Restoration Bonds (123 ) (136 ) (131 ) Distribution from AOL Time Warner Litigation Settlement 32 - 3 Additional Distribution to ZENS Holders (27 ) - (3 ) Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 16 51 15 Other Income, net 17 14 39 Income Before Income Taxes 588 723 548 Income Tax Expense (193 ) (277 ) (176 ) Net Income $ 395 $ 446 $ 372 Basic Earnings Per Share $ 1.23 $ 1.32 $ 1.02 Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.15 $ 1.30 $ 1.01 2009 Compared to 2008 Net Income. We reported net income of $372 million ($1.01 per diluted share) for 2009 compared to $446 million ($1.30 per diluted share) for the same period in 2008. The decrease in net income of $74 million was primarily due to a $149 million decrease in operating income, a $45 million increase in interest expense due primarily to higher interest rates and higher levels of debt during 2009, excluding transition and system restoration bond-related interest expense, a $36 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and a $196 million decrease in the gain on our indexed debt securities. These decreases in net income were partially offset by a $101 million decrease in income tax expense, a $221 million increase in the gain on our marketable securities, $23 million of carrying costs related to Hurricane Ike restoration costs included in Other Income, net and a $5 million decrease in interest expense on transition and system restoration bonds. Income Tax Expense. Our 2009 effective tax rate of 32.1% differed from the 2008 effective tax rate of 38.4% primarily due to the settlement of our federal income tax return examinations for tax years 2004 and 2005 and a reduction in state income taxes related to adjustments in prior years state estimates. For more information, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. 2008 Compared to 2007 Net Income. We reported net income of $446 million ($1.30 per diluted share) for 2008 compared to $395 million ($1.15 per diluted share) for the same period in 2007. The increase in net income of $51 million was primarily due to an $88 million increase in operating income, a $41 million decrease in interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, a $35 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related primarily to SESH and a $17 million increase in the gain on our indexed debt securities. These increases in net income were partially offset by an $84 million increase in income tax expense, a $25 million increase in the loss on our Time Warner investment and a $13 million increase in interest expense on transition bonds. Income Tax Expense. Our 2008 effective tax rate of 38.4% differed from the 2007 effective tax rate of 32.8% primarily as a result of revisions to the Texas State Franchise Tax Law (Texas margin tax), which was reported as an operating expense prior to 2008 and is now being reported as an income tax for CenterPoint Houston, and a Texas state tax examination in 2007. 45 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2007, 2008 and 2009. Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $545 million for 2009, consisting of $414 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $131 million related to transition and system restoration bond companies. For 2008, operating income totaled $545 million, consisting of $407 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $5 million from the competition transition charge (CTC), and $133 million related to transition bond companies. Revenues for the TDU increased due to higher transmission-related revenues ($50 million), in part reflecting the impact of a 46 Table of Contents transmission rate increase implemented in November 2008, the impact of Hurricane Ike in 2008 ($17 million), revenues from implementation of AMS ($33 million) and higher revenues due to customer growth ($17 million) from the addition of over 29,000 new customers, partially offset by declines in energy demand ($27 million). Operation and maintenance expenses increased $71 million primarily due to higher transmission costs billed by transmission providers ($18 million), increased operating and maintenance expenses that were postponed in 2008 as a result of Hurricane Ike restoration efforts ($10 million), higher pension and other employee benefit costs ($10 million), expenses related to AMS ($14 million) and a gain on a land sale in 2008 ($9 million). Increased depreciation expense related to increased investment in AMS ($7 million) was offset by other declines in depreciation and amortization, primarily due to asset retirements. Taxes other than income taxes increased $7 million primarily as a result of a refund in 2008 of prior years state franchise taxes ($5 million). Changes in pension expense over our 2007 base year amount are being deferred until our next general rate case pursuant to Texas law. 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $545 million for 2008, consisting of $407 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $5 million from the CTC, and $133 million related to transition bond companies. For 2007, operating income totaled $561 million, consisting of $400 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $42 million from the CTC, and $119 million related to transition bond companies. Revenues for the TDU increased in 2008 due to customer growth, with over 30,000 metered customers added ($23 million), increased usage ($15 million) in part caused by favorable weather experienced, increased transmission-related revenues ($21 million) and increased revenues from ancillary services ($5 million), partially offset by reduced revenues due to Hurricane Ike ($17 million) and the settlement of the final fuel reconciliation in 2007 ($5 million). Operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher transmission costs ($43 million), the settlement of the final fuel reconciliation in 2007 ($13 million) and increased support services ($13 million), partially offset by a gain on sale of land ($9 million) and normal operating and maintenance expenses that were postponed as a result of Hurricane Ike restoration efforts ($10 million). Depreciation and amortization increased $34 million primarily due to amounts related to the CTC ($30 million), which were offset by similar amounts in revenues. Taxes other than income taxes declined $21 million primarily as a result of the Texas margin tax being classified as an income tax for financial reporting purposes in 2008 ($19 million) and a refund of prior years state franchise taxes ($5 million). Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2007, 2008 and 2009 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Revenues $ 3,759 $ 4,226 $ 3,384 Expenses: Natural gas 2,683 3,124 2,251 Operation and maintenance 579 589 639 Depreciation and amortization 155 157 161 Taxes other than income taxes 124 141 129 Total expenses 3,541 4,011 3,180 Operating Income $ 218 $ 215 $ 204 Throughput (in Bcf): Residential 172 175 173 Commercial and industrial 232 236 233 Total Throughput 404 411 406 Number of customers at end of period: Residential 2,961,110 2,987,222 3,002,114 Commercial and industrial 249,877 248,476 244,101 Total 3,210,987 3,235,698 3,246,215 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $204 million for 2009 compared to $215 million for 2008. Operating income declined ($11 million) primarily as a result of increased pension expense ($37 million) and higher labor and other benefit costs ($16 million), partially 47 Table of Contents offset by increased revenues from rate increases ($36 million) and lower bad debt expense ($15 million). Revenues related to both energy-efficiency costs and gross receipts taxes are substantially offset by the related expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4 million primarily due to higher plant balances. Taxes other than income taxes, net of the decrease in gross receipts taxes ($16 million), increased $4 million also primarily due to higher plant balances. 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $215 million for 2008 compared to $218 million for 2007. Operating income declined in 2008 due to a combination of non-weather-related usage ($13 million), due in part to higher gas prices, higher customer-related and support services costs ($9 million), higher bad debts and collection costs ($4 million), increased costs of materials and supplies ($4 million), and an increase in depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income taxes ($3 million) resulting from increased investment in property, plant and equipment. The adverse impacts on operating income were partially offset by the net impact of rate increases ($11 million), lower labor and benefits costs ($14 million), and customer growth from the addition of approximately 25,000 customers in 2008 ($6 million). Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2007, 2008 and 2009 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Revenues $ 3,579 $ 4,528 $ 2,230 Expenses: Natural gas 3,467 4,423 2,165 Operation and maintenance 31 39 39 Depreciation and amortization 5 3 4 Taxes other than income taxes 1 1 1 Total expenses 3,504 4,466 2,209 Operating Income $ 75 $ 62 $ 21 Throughput (in Bcf) 522 528 504 Number of customers at end of period 7,139 9,771 11,168 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $21 million for 2009 compared to $62 million for 2008. The decrease in operating income of $41 million was due to the unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market valuation for non-trading financial derivatives for 2009 of $23 million versus a favorable impact of $13 million for the same period in 2008. A further $28 million decrease in margin is attributable to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and an absence of summer storage spreads. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by a $6 million write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market for 2009 compared to a $30 million write-down in the same period last year. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment purchases and stores natural gas to meet certain future sales requirements and enters into derivative contracts to hedge the economic value of the future sales. 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in operating income in 2008 of $13 million primarily resulted from lower gains on sales of gas from previously written down inventory ($24 million) and higher operation and maintenance costs ($6 million), which were partially offset by improved margin as basis and summer/winter spreads increased ($12 million). In addition, 2008 included a gain from mark-to-market accounting ($13 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($30 million), compared to a charge to income from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading derivatives ($10 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($11 million) for 2007. 48 Table of Contents Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2007, 2008 and 2009 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Revenues $ 500 $ 650 $ 598 Expenses: Natural gas 83 155 97 Operation and maintenance 125 133 166 Depreciation and amortization 44 46 48 Taxes other than income taxes 11 23 31 Total expenses 263 357 342 Operating Income $ 237 $ 293 $ 256 Transportation throughput (in Bcf) 1,216 1,538 1,592 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $256 million for 2009 compared to $293 million for 2008. Margins (revenues less natural gas costs) increased $6 million primarily due to the Carthage to Perryville pipeline ($28 million) and new contracts with power generation customers ($20 million), partially offset by reduced other transportation margins and ancillary services ($42 million) primarily due to the decline in commodity prices from the significantly higher levels in 2008. Operations and maintenance expenses increased due to a gain on the sale of two storage development projects in 2008 ($18 million) and costs associated with incremental facilities ($12 million) and increased pension expenses ($9 million). These expenses were partially offset by a write-down associated with pipeline assets removed from service in the third quarter of 2008 ($7 million). Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $2 million and taxes other than income taxes increased by $8 million, $2 million of which was due to 2008 tax refunds. 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $293 million for 2008 compared to $237 million for 2007. The increase in operating income in 2008 was primarily driven by increased margins (revenues less natural gas costs) on the Carthage to Perryville pipeline that went into service in May 2007 ($51 million), increased transportation and ancillary services ($27 million), and a gain on the sale of two storage development projects ($18 million). These increases were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses ($19 million), a write-down associated with pipeline assets removed from service ($7 million), increased depreciation expense ($2 million), and higher taxes other than income taxes ($12 million), largely due to tax refunds in 2007. Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $6 million, $36 million and $7 million in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, from its 50% interest in SESH, a jointly-owned pipeline. The 2007 and 2008 year-end results include $6 million and $33 million of pre-operating allowance for funds used during construction, respectively. The 2009 results include a non-cash pre-tax charge of $16 million to reflect SESH decision to discontinue the use of guidance for accounting for regulated operations, which was partially offset by the receipt of a one-time payment related to the construction of the pipeline and a reduction in estimated property taxes, of which our 50% share was $5 million. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, equity earnings from normal operations was $3 million and $18 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. These amounts are included in Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption. 49 Table of Contents Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2007, 2008 and 2009 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Revenues $ 175 $ 252 $ 241 Expenses: Natural gas (4 ) 21 51 Operation and maintenance 66 69 77 Depreciation and amortization 11 12 15 Taxes other than income taxes 3 3 4 Total expenses 76 105 147 Operating Income $ 99 $ 147 $ 94 Gathering throughput (in Bcf) 398 421 426 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $94 million for 2009 compared to $147 million for 2008. Operating margin from new projects and core gathering services increased approximately $24 million for 2009 when compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to continued development in the shale plays. This increase was offset primarily by the effect of a decline in commodity prices of approximately $54 million from the significantly higher prices experienced in 2008. Operating income for 2009 also included higher costs associated with incremental facilities ($4 million) and increased pension cost ($2 million). Operating income for 2008 benefited from a one-time gain ($11 million) related to a settlement and contract buyout of one of our customers and a gain on sale of assets ($6 million). 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $147 million for 2008 compared to $99 million for 2007. The increase in operating income of $48 million resulted from higher margins (revenue less natural gas costs) from gas gathering, ancillary services and higher commodity prices ($34 million) and a one-time gain related to a settlement and contract buyout of one of our customers ($11 million). Operating expenses increased from 2007 to 2008 due to higher expenses associated with new assets and general cost increases, partially offset by a gain related to the sale of assets in 2008 ($6 million). Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $10 million, $15 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, from its 50% interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. The decrease is driven by a decrease in natural gas liquid prices. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption. Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2007, 2008 and 2009 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Revenues $ 10 $ 11 $ 11 Expenses 15 7 Operating Income (Loss) $ (5 ) $ 11 $ 4 2009 Compared to 2008. Our Other Operations business segment operating income in 2009 compared to 2008 decreased by $7 million primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization expense ($4 million) and an increase in franchise taxes ($3 million). 50 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Other Operations business segment operating income in 2008 compared to 2007 increased by $16 million primarily as a result of a decrease in franchise taxes ($7 million) and a decrease in benefits accruals ($4 million). LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flows The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2007, 2008 and 2009 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 774 $ 851 $ 1,841 Investing activities (1,300 ) (1,368 ) (896 ) Financing activities 528 555 (372 ) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 increased $990 million compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased cash used in net regulatory assets and liabilities primarily related to Hurricane Ike restoration costs in 2008 ($366 million), decreased cash used in net margin deposits ($298 million), decreased cash used in gas storage inventory ($246 million) and increased cash provided by net accounts receivable/payable ($41 million). Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased $77 million compared to 2007 primarily due to decreased tax payments/increased tax refunds ($289 million), increased net accounts receivable/payable ($190 million), increased fuel cost recovery ($138 million) and increased pre-tax income ($131 million). These increases were partially offset by increased net regulatory assets and liabilities ($447 million) and increased net margin deposits ($247 million). Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $472 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to decreased notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates of $498 million, decreased investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $91 million and decreased restricted cash of transition bond companies of $37 million, offset by increased capital expenditures of $140 million primarily related to our Field Services business segment. Net cash used in investing activities increased $68 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increased investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $167 million, primarily related to the SESH pipeline project, which was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures of $94 million. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 increased $927 million compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($2.6 billion), and decreased short-term borrowings ($19 million), which were partially offset by decreased repayments of long-term debt ($1.2 billion), increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock ($424 million) and increased proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt ($77 million). Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 increased $27 million compared to 2007 primarily due to increased borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($779 million) and increased proceeds from long-term debt ($188 million), which were partially offset by increased repayments of long-term debt ($825 million) and decreased short-term borrowings ($124 million). 51 Table of Contents Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2010 include the following: approximately $1.2 billion of capital requirements; maturing long-term debt aggregating approximately $206 million; $290 million for our January 2010 purchase of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf; $241 million of scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds; $45 million for our January 2010 redemption of debentures; and dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on debt. We expect that borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in 2010. Cash needs or discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2009 and estimates of our capital requirements for 2010 through 2014 (in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Electric Transmission & Distribution (1) $ 428 $ 557 $ 563 $ 488 $ 503 $ 484 Natural Gas Distribution 165 210 237 241 259 248 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 2 6 4 16 5 5 Interstate Pipelines 176 171 192 245 164 94 Field Services 348 226 163 126 95 85 Other Operations 29 38 59 40 30 30 Total $ 1,148 $ 1,208 $ 1,218 $ 1,156 $ 1,056 $ 946 __________ (1) Includes expenditures of $94 million in 2009 and capital requirements of $181 million, $172 million, $49 million, $38 million and $34 million in 2010 through 2014, respectively, related to AMS and Intelligent Grid, net of a $200 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The award is contingent on successful completion of negotiations with the DOE. 52 Table of Contents The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2011-2012 2013-2014 2015 and thereafter Transition and system restoration bond debt $ 3,046 $ 241 $ 590 $ 565 $ 1,650 Other long-term debt(1) 7,668 541 615 2,171 4,341 Interest payments - transition and system restoration bond debt(2) 834 135 245 187 267 Interest payments - other long-term debt(2) 3,919 433 791 608 2,087 Short-term borrowings 55 55 - - - Capital leases 1 - - - 1 Operating leases(3) 51 12 22 10 7 Benefit obligations(4) - - - - - Purchase obligations(5) 9 9 - - - Non-trading derivative liabilities 93 51 42 - - Other commodity commitments(6) 2,558 439 917 659 543 Income taxes(7) - - - - - Other 25 7 12 6 - Total contractual cash obligations $ 18,259 $ 1,923 $ 3,234 $ 4,206 $ 8,896 __________ (1) ZENS obligations are included in the 2015 and thereafter column at their contingent principal amount payable in 2029 of $814 million. These obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS ($300 million at December 31, 2009), as discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. (2) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2009. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 10(c) to our consolidated financial statements. (4) Material contributions to our qualified pension plan are not expected in 2010. However, we expect to contribute approximately $9 million and $19 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2010. (5) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with our Interstate Pipelines business segment. (6) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 10(a) to our consolidated financial statements. (7) As of December 31, 2009, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $187 million. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which any such liabilities might be paid. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than operating leases and the guaranties described below, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI Energy, Inc. (RRI) (formerly known as Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc.) to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation. Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI has agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas purchase and transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties. As of December 31, 2009, RRI was not required to provide security to CERC. If RRI should fail to perform the contractual obligations, 53 Table of Contents CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC obligations. Debt Financing Transactions . In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds due in March 2014 with an interest rate of 7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under CenterPoint Houston revolving credit facility and the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ike. In August 2009, SESH closed on a private debt offering in the amount of $375 million. Also during 2009, CERC Corp. made a capital contribution to SESH in the amount of $137 million. Using $186 million of its proceeds from the debt offering and the capital contribution, SESH repaid the note receivable it owed to CERC Corp., which note had a principal balance of $323 million at the time of the repayment. CERC Corp. used the proceeds to repay borrowings under its credit facility. In January 2010, we purchased $290 million principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds. Prior to the purchase, the pollution control bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 5.125%. The purchase reduces temporary investments and leverage while providing us with the flexibility to finance future capital needs in the tax-exempt market through a remarketing of these bonds. In January 2010, CERC Corp. redeemed $45 million of its outstanding 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. System Restoration Bonds. In November 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued approximately $665 million of system restoration bonds through its CenterPoint Energy Restoration Bond Company, LLC subsidiary with interest rates of 1.833% to 4.243% and final maturity dates ranging from February 2016 to August 2023. The bonds will be repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers. Equity Financing Transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received net proceeds of approximately $280 million from the issuance of 24.2 million common shares in an underwritten public offering, net proceeds of $148 million from the issuance of 14.3 million common shares through a continuous offering program, proceeds of approximately $57 million from the sale of approximately 4.9 million common shares to our defined contribution plan and proceeds of approximately $15 million from the sale of approximately 1.3 million common shares to participants in our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. Credit and Receivables Facilities. In October 2009, CenterPoint Houston terminated its $600 million 364-day secured credit facility which had been arranged in November 2008 following Hurricane Ike. In October 2009, the size of CERC Corp. revolving credit facility was reduced from $950 million to $915 million through removal of Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman) as a lender. Prior to its removal, Lehman had a $35 million commitment to lend. All credit facility loans to CERC Corp. that were funded by Lehman were repaid in September 2009. In October 2009, CERC amended its receivables facility to extend the termination date to October 8, 2010. Availability under CERC 364-day receivables facility ranges from $150 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. 54 Table of Contents As of February 15, 2010, we had the following facilities (in millions): Date Executed Company Type of Facility Size of Facility Amount Utilized at February 15, 2010 (1) Termination Date June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Energy Revolver $ 1,156 $ 20 (2) June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Houston Revolver 289 4 (2) June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CERC Corp. Revolver 915 - June 29, 2012 October 9, 2009 CERC Receivables 375 - October 8, 2010 ________ (1) Based on the debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant contained in our $1.2 billion credit facility, we would have been permitted to incur incremental borrowings on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2009 of approximately $1.3 billion. Had the February 2010 amendment to such covenant described below been in effect, we would have been permitted to incur an additional $800 million of borrowings at such time in the event a qualifying disaster occurred. Since amounts advanced under CERC Corp.'s receivables facility are not included in this debt to EBITDA covenant calculation, such amounts are not included in the estimated amounts of permitted incremental borrowings. (2) Represents outstanding letters of credit. Our $1.2 billion credit facility has a first drawn cost of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 55 basis points based on our current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to EBITDA covenant (as those terms are defined in the facility). Such covenant was modified twice in 2008 to provide additional debt capacity. The second modification was to provide debt capacity pending the financing of system restoration costs following Hurricane Ike. That modification was terminated with CenterPoint Houston issuance of bonds to securitize such costs in November 2009. In February 2010, we amended our credit facility to modify the financial ratio covenant to allow for a temporary increase of the permitted ratio of debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to EBITDA from 5 times to 5.5 times if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that CenterPoint Houston has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed $100 million in a calendar year, all or part of which CenterPoint Houston intends to seek to recover through securitization financing. Such temporary increase in the financial ratio covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of (i) the completion of the securitization financing, (ii) the first anniversary of our certification or (iii) the revocation of such certification. CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility contains a debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) to total capitalization covenant. The facility first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings. CERC Corp. $915 million credit facility first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt to total capitalization covenant. Under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp $915 million credit facility, an additional utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee fluctuate based on the borrower credit rating. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. consider customary. We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants contained in the respective credit facilities as disclosed above. 55 Table of Contents Our $1.2 billion credit facility backstops a $1.0 billion CenterPoint Energy commercial paper program under which we began issuing commercial paper in June 2005. The $915 million CERC Corp. credit facility backstops a $915 million commercial paper program under which CERC Corp. began issuing commercial paper in February 2008. The CenterPoint Energy commercial paper is rated "Not Prime" by Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), "A-3" by Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and "F3" by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch). The CERC Corp. commercial paper is rated "P-3" by Moody s, "A-3" by S&P, and "F2" by Fitch. As a result of the credit ratings on the two commercial paper programs, we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short-term borrowing requirements. We cannot assure you that these ratings, or the credit ratings set forth below in " Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings," will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. Securities Registered with the SEC. In October 2008, CenterPoint Energy and CenterPoint Houston jointly registered indeterminate principal amounts of CenterPoint Houston general mortgage bonds and CenterPoint Energy senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of CenterPoint Energy shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. In addition, CERC Corp. has a shelf registration statement covering $500 million principal amount of senior debt securities. Temporary Investments. As of February 15, 2010, CenterPoint Houston had external temporary investments of $450 million. Money Pool. We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. As of February 15, 2010, Moody s, S&P, and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook(1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Ba1 Stable BBB- Negative BBB- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt Baa1 Positive BBB+ Negative A- Stable CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa3 Stable BBB Negative BBB Stable __________ (1) A Moody rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A "stable" outlook from Fitch encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp. $915 million credit facility. If our credit ratings or those of CenterPoint Houston or CERC had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at December 31, 2009, the impact on the borrowing costs under our bank credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions. 56 Table of Contents CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from its largest supplier under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $120 million based on CERC Corp. S&P senior unsecured long-term debt rating of BBB. Under these agreements, CERC may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2009, the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $114 million ($84 million of which is associated with price stabilization activities of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment). Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2009, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $241 million; however, utilized credit capacity was $67 million. Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $188 million as of December 31, 2009. The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels. In September 1999, we issued 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million remain outstanding at December 31, 2009. Each ZENS note was originally exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS note are adjusted for certain corporate events. As of December 31, 2009, the reference shares for each ZENS note consisted of 0.5 share of TW Common, 0.125505 share of Time Warner Cable Inc. common stock (TWC Common) and 0.045455 share of AOL Inc. common stock (AOL Common), which reflects adjustments resulting from the March 2009 distribution by Time Warner Inc. of shares of TWC Common, Time Warner Inc. March 2009 reverse stock split and the December 2009 distribution by Time Warner Inc. of shares of AOL Common. If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS notes and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares would typically cease when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common, TWC Common and AOL Common shares are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allows us to defer until 2014 taxes due as a result of the retirement of ZENS notes that would have otherwise been payable in 2009 or 2010 and pay such taxes over the period from 2014 through 2018. Accordingly, if on December 31, 2009, all ZENS notes had been exchanged for cash, we could have deferred taxes of approximately $379 million that would have otherwise been payable in 2009. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a 57 Table of Contents default. In addition, four outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $950 million in principal amount as of February 15, 2010, provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures . From time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including gas purchases, gas price and weather hedging and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various regulatory actions; the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of RRI indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor; the ability of REPs that are subsidiaries of NRG Retail LLC and TXU Energy, which are CenterPoint Houston two largest customers, to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and various other risks identified in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money. CenterPoint Houston credit facilities limit CenterPoint Houston debt (excluding transition and system restoration bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. CERC Corp. bank facility and its receivables facility limit CERC debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt, excluding transition and system restoration bonds, to EBITDA covenant. Such covenant was modified twice in 2008 to provide additional debt capacity. The second modification was to provide debt capacity pending the financing of system restoration 58 Table of Contents costs following Hurricane Ike. That modification was terminated with CenterPoint Houston issuance of bonds to securitize such costs in November 2009. In February 2010, we amended our $1.2 billion credit facility to modify this covenant to allow for a temporary increase in debt capacity if CenterPoint Houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. Accounting for Rate Regulation Accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and portions of our Interstate Pipelines business segment apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2009, we had recorded regulatory assets of $3.7 billion and regulatory liabilities of $921 million. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. No impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis at July 1, 2009. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rates, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, 59 Table of Contents present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read "- Other Significant Matters - Pension Plans" for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 2(p) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA. We made no contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2008; however, a discretionary contribution of $13 million was made in 2009. The minimum funding requirements for this plan did not require contributions for the respective years. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $8 million and $7 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. As the sponsor of a plan, we are required to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan over-funded status or as a liability such plan under-funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $434 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2010 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension cost was $15 million, $1 million and $111 million for 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, of which $12 million, $1 million and $60 million impacted pre-tax earnings. CenterPoint Houston actuarially determined pension and other postemployment expenses for 2009 in excess of the 2007 base year amount are being deferred for rate making purposes until its next general rate case pursuant to Texas law. CenterPoint Houston deferred as a regulatory asset $32 million in pension and other postemployment expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2009, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of December 31, 2008. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2009, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.70%, which is a 1.20% decrease from the 6.90% discount rate assumed in 2008. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension cost for 2010, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $86 million, of which we expect $44 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.0% and a discount rate of 5.70% as of December 31, 2009. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.5% (from 8.00% to 7.50%), 2010 pension cost would increase by approximately $7 million. As of December 31, 2009, the pension plan projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded benefit restoration plan, exceeded plan assets by $434 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 5.70% to 5.20%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2010 pension expense by approximately $83 million and $4 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2009 by $66 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2009 of $11 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be. 61 Table of Contents
