Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. Outlook Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women healthcare markets. However, events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by U.S. debt and uncertainty surrounding employment, housing and credit concerns together with the European debt crisis and related foreign currency volatility impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2013 and beyond. We compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology and silicone hydrogel Aquaform technology. We believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we introduce new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets, including through acquisitions. Sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, a major product material in the industry, have grown significantly. CooperVision markets monthly and two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our Biofinity and Avaira brands and a multifocal lens under Biofinity. In July 2012, CooperVision initiated limited marketing of our first silicone hydrogel single-use spherical lens in selected European markets. Competitive silicone hydrogel single-use lens products are gaining market share and represent a risk to our business. Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability. In fiscal 2012, we launched Proclear 1 Day multifocal and we are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance CooperVision worldwide product lines. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials and new lens designs, including multifocal and single-use lenses. In August 2011, CooperVision initiated a recall on limited lots of Avaira Toric contact lenses, and in November 2011, this recall was expanded to cover limited lots of Avaira Sphere contact lenses. Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere lenses that were subject to the recall represented less than 2% of the Company's fiscal 2011 net sales. While Avaira Toric was taken off the market, Avaira Sphere remained on the market throughout the recall. On April 15, 2012, the FDA granted us a Special 510(k) clearance to return Avaira Toric lenses to the market, and in May 2012, CooperVision re-launched Avaira Toric with shipments available for select distribution. We are continuing to roll-out Avaira Toric fitting sets and are working to build the Avaira brand in the U.S. two-week market. 39 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The medical device segment of the women's healthcare market is highly fragmented. CooperSurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies and products that complement its business model. In July 2012, we purchased Origio, a global in-vitro fertilization company, discussed below. We intend to continue to invest in CooperSurgical's business through acquisitions of companies and product lines. As part of the new health care reform law, a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, is effective January 1, 2013. CooperVision's products are not subject to this new tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax. However, United States sales of almost all of CooperSurgical's products will be subject to this new tax beginning in our fiscal first quarter of 2013. On May 31, 2012, we entered into an amendment to our senior unsecured Credit Agreement. The aggregate commitment was increased to $1.0 billion from $750.0 million, and the $234.4 million outstanding balance on the term loan was fully repaid using the facility. The amended facility offers additional availability, lower interest rates and extends the maturity date to May 31, 2017, from January 12, 2016. In addition, we have the ability to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $500.0 million. At October 31, 2012, we had $653.7 million available under the amended Credit Agreement. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and long-term cash requirements for capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and cash dividends. Recent Acquisition On July 11, 2012, we completed a voluntary tender offer for the outstanding shares of Origio a/s at a purchase price of Norwegian krone (NOK) 28 per share in cash, or $147.4 million, and acquired about 97% of the outstanding shares. During our fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, we acquired additional shares representing a total of 98% and in November 2012, we completed a mandatory redemption to obtain the remaining shares in accordance with the Danish Companies Act. Cooper, through its subsidiaries, financed the acquisition with available offshore cash and credit facilities. Origio is a global in-vitro fertilization (IVF) medical device company that develops, manufactures and distributes highly specialized products that target IVF treatment with a goal to make fertility treatment safer, more efficient and convenient. Based in Malov, Denmark, Origio has approximately 320 employees. We assumed about $45.4 million of Origio's debt that we repaid concurrent with the acquisition. Our preliminary allocation of the purchase price at fair value includes amortizable intangible assets of $107.7 million and goodwill of $95.5 million. We incurred $4.9 million of acquisition costs which were reported as selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income (see Note 2. Acquisitions). 2012 Compared with 2011 Highlights: 2012 vs. 2011 Net sales up 9% to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. Gross margin 64% of net sales up from 60%. Operating income up 25% to $283.4 million from $227.6 million. Interest expense down 32% to $11.8 million from $17.3 million. Diluted earnings per share up 39% to $5.05 from $3.63. Operating cash flow $315.1 million down 6% from $336.3 million. 40 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fiscal 2012 pre-tax results include a $1.4 million loss related to the May 31, 2012, amendment to our Credit Agreement, and costs related to the acquisition of Origio consisting of $4.9 million in direct acquisition costs recorded in selling, general and administrative expense and $0.4 million net gain related to the repayment of debt acquired recorded in interest expense. Fiscal 2011 pre-tax results included a charge of $20.4 million related to the limited recall of Avaira contact lenses, costs of $16.5 million related to the redemption of our Senior Notes, a $10.0 million charge related to the settlement of all claims in a patent infringement lawsuit and restructuring costs of $1.9 million related to the CooperVision manufacturing restructuring plan that was completed in fiscal 2011.

CooperVision develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market. CooperSurgical develops, manufactures and markets medical devices and procedure solutions to improve healthcare delivery to women. Net Sales Growth by Business Unit Our consolidated net sales grew by $114.3 million in fiscal 2012 and $172.3 million in 2011: ($ in millions) 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2011 vs. 2010 % Change CooperVision $ 68.1 6 % $ 150.6 16 % CooperSurgical 46.2 22 % 21.7 12 % $ 114.3 9 % $ 172.3 15 % CooperVision Net Sales The contact lens market has two major product categories: Spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects. Toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. 41 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear, products are sold with recommended replacement schedules, often defined as modalities, with the primary modalities being single-use, two-week and monthly. CooperVision offers spherical, aspherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities. The contact lens market consists primarily of disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Significantly, the market for spherical lenses is growing with value-added spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. CooperVision Proclear brand aspheric, toric and multifocal contact lenses, manufactured using PC Technology, help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort. CooperVision Biofinity brand silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses, Avaira brand spherical and toric products and our silicone hydrogel single-use product are manufactured using proprietary Aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear. We believe that it is important to develop a full range of multifocal and single-use silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel products offered by our major competitors. CooperVision net sales growth included increases in single-use spheres up 10%, representing 22% of net sales. Total toric lenses grew 5% and were 30% of net sales, and multifocal lenses grew 26% to 8% of net sales up from 7% in the prior year. Silicone hydrogel products grew 28% worldwide and represented 36% of net sales up from 30% in the prior year. Proclear product sales were flat as compared to the prior year and represented 25% of net sales down from 27% in the prior year. Older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 16% and 20%, respectively, and together represented 3% of net sales, down from 4% in the prior year. CooperVision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. CooperVision Net Sales by Geography ($ in millions) 2012 2011 % Change Americas $ 498.9 $ 469.7 6 % EMEA 402.3 398.5 1 % Asia Pacific 288.0 252.9 14 % $ 1,189.2 $ 1,121.1 6 % CooperVision worldwide net sales grew 6% in the year-to-year comparison. Americas net sales grew 6%, primarily due to market gains of CooperVision silicone hydrogel lenses and single-use lenses. EMEA net sales grew 1% primarily driven by sales growth of silicone hydrogel lenses, as sales in fiscal 2012 were negatively impacted due to the weakening euro and the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar. Net sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 14%, primarily due to sales growth in fiscal 2012 of single-use lenses and silicone hydrogel lenses. Asia Pacific net sales growth was positively impacted by the strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. CooperVision net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products, primarily silicone hydrogel lenses. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CooperVision sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. 42 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations CooperSurgical Net Sales CooperSurgical fiscal 2012 net sales increased 22% from fiscal 2011 to $255.9 million with net sales growth excluding acquisitions of 6%. Origio net sales of $25.1 million are included in fiscal 2012. Sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 19% and represented 36% of CooperSurgical fiscal 2012 net sales, 40% excluding Origio's IVF business, compared to 37% in the prior year. CooperSurgical sales are primarily comprised of women healthcare products used by gynecologists and obstetricians in office, surgical and fertility procedures. The balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CooperSurgical does not actively market. Unit growth and product mix along with increased average realized prices on disposable products have influenced organic sales growth. 2011 Compared with 2010 Highlights: 2011 vs. 2010 Net sales up 15% to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2010. Gross margin 60% of net sales up from 58%. Operating income up 20% to $227.6 million from $189.9 million. Interest expense down 53% to $17.3 million from $36.7 million. Diluted earnings per share up 49% to $3.63 from $2.43. Operating cash flow up 26% to $336.3 million from $267.7 million. Fiscal 2011 pre-tax results included a reserve of $20.4 million related to the limited recall of Avaira contact lenses, costs of $16.5 million related to the redemption of our Senior Notes, a $10.0 million charge related to the settlement of all claims in a patent infringement lawsuit and restructuring costs of $1.9 million related to the CooperVision manufacturing restructuring plan that was completed in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, pre-tax results included settlement charges of $27.8 million related to the securities class action litigation and the derivative litigation and $16.1 million related to the CooperVision manufacturing restructuring plan.

Total toric lenses grew 16%, including 26% growth of single-use toric lenses, and multifocal lenses grew 4%. Silicone hydrogel products grew 49% worldwide. Proclear products increased 10% driven by growth of single-use lenses. Older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 13% and 17%, respectively. CooperVision Net Sales by Geography ($ in millions) 2011 2010 % Change Americas $ 469.7 $ 432.8 9 % EMEA 398.5 351.8 13 % Asia Pacific 252.9 185.9 36 % $ 1,121.1 $ 970.5 16 % CooperVision's worldwide net sales grew 16% in the period-to-period comparison. Americas net sales grew 9%, primarily due to market gains of CooperVision's silicone hydrogel contact lenses and single-use lenses. In our fiscal first quarter of 2010, we recorded $10.1 million of reductions to Americas net sales due to out-of-period adjustments to increase accruals for rebates that were under-accrued in fiscal 2009. EMEA net sales grew 13% driven by increases in sales of silicone hydrogel lenses and single-use lenses. Net sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 36%, primarily due to sales growth of single-use spherical and toric products and silicone hydrogel lenses; these results included sales of $31.3 million related to product lines acquired on December 1, 2010, from Asahikasei Aime Co., Ltd. CooperVision's net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products, primarily silicone hydrogel lenses, along with acquisitions and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CooperVision's sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CooperSurgical Net Sales CooperSurgical's fiscal 2011 net sales increased 12% from fiscal 2010 to $209.7 million with net sales growth excluding acquisitions of 8%. Sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 23% and represented 37% of CooperSurgical's fiscal 2011 net sales compared to 33% in fiscal 2010. CooperSurgical sales are primarily comprised of women's healthcare products used by gynecologists and obstetricians in both office and surgical procedures. The balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women's healthcare which CooperSurgical does not actively market. Unit growth and product mix along with increased average realized prices on disposable products influenced organic sales growth. 44 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 2012 Compared to 2011 and 2011 Compared to 2010 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2012 2011 2010 CooperVision 63 % 60 % 57 % CooperSurgical 66 % 65 % 64 % Consolidated 64 % 60 % 58 % The sequential increases in CooperVision gross margin over the fiscal years presented are largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, primarily the shift to higher margin silicone hydrogel products. CooperVision's gross margin in fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by the $20.2 million reserve for inventory and return provisions related to the recall of certain lots of Avaira contact lenses, discussed above. Gross margin also reflects efficiencies associated with the 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan that was completed in the fiscal first quarter of 2011. There were no costs associated with this plan recorded in fiscal 2012. Costs associated with the plan, recorded as cost of sales, were $1.9 million in fiscal 2011 and $16.0 million for fiscal 2010. The increase in CooperSurgical gross margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is largely attributable to manufacturing efficiency improvements and product mix. The changes in product mix include higher margins on products used in surgical procedures that grew 19% over the prior year and represented 36% of net sales in fiscal 2012, or 40% excluding Origio sales for the last four months of 2012, compared to 37% in fiscal 2011 and 33% in fiscal 2010. The increase was partially offset by the inclusion of four months of sales of lower margin IVF products from the acquisition of Origio in July 2012. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) ($ in millions) 2012 % Net Sales 2011 % Net Sales 2010 % Net Sales CooperVision $ 433.5 36 % $ 410.2 37 % $ 343.0 35 % CooperSurgical 93.0 36 % 70.6 34 % 61.6 33 % Headquarters 38.4 32.3 28.5 $ 564.9 39 % $ 513.1 38 % $ 433.1 37 % Consolidated SGA increased 10% in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and 18% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The 6% increase in CooperVision's SGA in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars and the overall increase in SGA as a percent of net sales from 35% in fiscal 2010 to 37% and 36% in fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively, is primarily due to our investment in sales and marketing, including increased headcount, to reach new customers and to promote our silicone hydrogel products. The growth in fiscal 2012 also includes increased general and administrative expenses, primarily due to legal expenses, and the growth in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 includes the $10.0 million patent litigation settlement discussed below. The 32% increase in CooperSurgical's SGA in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as well as the increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to operating expenses related to Origio as well as approximately $4.6 million of acquisition costs that were expensed. Fiscal 2012 SGA was 34% as a percentage of net sales, the same as fiscal 2011, excluding Origio operating expenses and related acquisition costs. In addition to the acquisition and integration activities related to Origio, CooperSurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products, with emphasis on products used in surgical procedures, and to support anticipated further growth. The 15% increase in CooperSurgical SGA in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily 45 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations due to increased selling and marketing costs to support higher sales and anticipated further growth together with legal expenses related to business acquisitions during the period. Corporate headquarters SGA increased 19% in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased headcount, share-based compensation costs and legal expenses. The 14% growth in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increased legal costs and share-based compensation expense partially offset by reduced consulting fees. Research and Development Expense ($ in millions) 2012 % Net Sales 2011 % Net Sales 2010 % Net Sales CooperVision $ 42.3 4 % $ 37.0 3 % $ 29.9 3 % CooperSurgical 9.4 4 % 6.6 3 % 5.4 3 % $ 51.7 4 % $ 43.6 3 % $ 35.3 3 % The sequential increases in CooperVision's research and development expenses over the fiscal years presented and the fiscal 2012 increase as a percentage of net sales as compared to the prior two years are primarily due to investments in new technologies, clinical trials and increased headcount. CooperVision research and development activities primarily include programs to develop single-use and multifocal silicone hydrogel products. CooperSurgical research and development expense increased 43% in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to investments in the design and upgrade of surgical procedure devices and the addition of Origio's in-vitro fertilization product development. The 23% increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to investments in the design of the next generation product line of uterine manipulators. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $24.0 million in fiscal 2012, $20.5 million in fiscal 2011 and $18.1 million in fiscal 2010. The 17% increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to intangible assets from acquisitions including the acquisition of Origio in July 2012 and those completed in fiscal 2011. Operating Income Operating income grew $93.5 million or 49% between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2012, increasing $55.8 million or 25% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 and $37.7 million or 20% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010.

CooperSurgical's operating income increased in absolute dollars primarily due to the increase in gross profit that also includes the results of Origio since July 2012 and operating income decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the $4.6 million of Origio acquisition costs which were expensed as selling, general and administrative expense. 46 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 32% to $11.8 million in fiscal 2012 constituting 0.8% of net sales in fiscal 2012 as compared to 1.3% of net sales in fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2012 decrease reflects lower average debt and a reduction in our long-term borrowings used for capital expenditures together with lower interest rates as a result of the redemption of our 7.125% Senior Notes in February 2011. Interest expense decreased 53% as compared to fiscal 2010 to $17.3 million in 2011 and decreased 17% as compared to fiscal 2009 to $36.7 million in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 decrease reflects lower interest rates primarily as a result of the redemption of our Senior Notes in February 2011 and lower average debt. The fiscal 2010 decrease primarily reflects reduced long-term borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates. We had $346.3 million in loans under our Credit Agreement at October 31, 2012, compared to $339.7 million at October 31, 2011. Insurance Proceeds On October 28, 2011, a manufacturing building in the UK experienced an incident in which a pipe broke in our fire suppression system, causing water and fire retardant foam damage to the facility. While this incident did not impact our existing customers, the repairs to the facility and resultant decrease in manufacturing capacity impacted the timing of marketing initiatives. We are in the process of discussing business interruption insurance claims with our insurer. We received payments of $5.0 million in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, as an advance toward a full settlement, recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Losses on Extinguishment of Debt In fiscal 2012, we recorded a $1.4 million loss related to the amendment to our Credit Agreement on May 31, 2012. In fiscal 2011, we recorded a $16.5 million loss related to the repurchase of all outstanding 7.125% Senior Notes that includes the write-off of about $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of $12.1 million. Settlements On December 2, 2011, CooperVision and Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. entered into a settlement agreement under which CooperVision agreed to make a lump sum payment of $10.0 million to Rembrandt, and Rembrandt granted a covenant not to sue regarding patent infringement claims. The Company recorded a charge in selling, general and administrative expense for the settlement in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011. The Company and several of its directors and officers had been named in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit, and on May 4, 2010, the Company announced that it reached an agreement in principle and recorded a charge in our fiscal second quarter of 2010 to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit for $27.0 million, which we funded into escrow in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. The Court granted final approval of the proposed settlement on December 13, 2010. The Company also was a nominal defendant in shareholder derivative litigation against several current and former officers and directors of the Company. The Company reached a settlement agreement to pay attorney's fees of counsel to the plaintiffs in the amount of $750 thousand. The Company recorded a charge for the settlement amount in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Share Repurchase In December 2011, we announced a $150.0 million share repurchase plan authorized by the Company Board of Directors. During fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased 984 thousand shares of our common stock for $71.1 million at a weighted-average purchase price of $72.30 per share and as of October 31, 2012, the 47 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company had remaining authorization to repurchase about $78.9 million of our common stock. On December 5, 2012, this plan was amended to increase the total authorized repurchase amount to $300.0 million, with $228.9 million remaining available, and to change the plan expiration date to indefinite. See Note 13. Subsequent Events. Other Income (Expense), Net Years Ended October 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Foreign exchange (loss) gain $ (1.5 ) $ (1.0 ) $ (1.2 ) Other, net 1.7 0.1 $ 0.2 $ (1.0 ) $ (1.1 ) Provision for Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $26.8 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $17.3 million in fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate (ETR) (provision for income taxes divided by pretax income) for fiscal 2012 was 9.7% and for fiscal 2011 was 9.0%. The increase in the ETR is driven by changes in our geographic mix of income. The ETR is below the United States statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent periods with income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as compared to income earned in the United States. As a result, the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income, primarily within CooperVision but augmented by CooperSurigical's July 2012 acquisition of Origio, has decreased over recent fiscal periods. A reduction in the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where the Company operates are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the United States. On April 1, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Notice of Deficiency to the Company in connection with its audit of the Company income tax returns for the years 2005 and 2006. The Notice asserted that the Company is subject to additional taxes due for its tax year 2005 under the anti-deferral provisions of Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. A settlement concerning the 2005 claimed deficiency was subsequently reached with District Counsel for the IRS which effectively settled all related matters. The decision document was filed with the U.S. Tax Court on January 19, 2012, with an agreed net deficiency of about $50 thousand. Share-Based Compensation Plans The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2012 was $22.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, compared to $14.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in fiscal 2011. As of October 31, 2012, there was $43.2 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards: $7.6 million for stock options; $28.6 million for restricted stock units; and $7.0 million for performance shares. The unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 2.5 years for nonvested stock options, 2.7 years for restricted stock units and 1.6 years for performance shares. Cash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation arrangements for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $55.1 million, $82.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. The use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate 48 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of fair value. The expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. If our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2012 would have increased by approximately $2. To determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company's stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. If our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2012 would have increased by less than $1. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. The Company grants performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers if the Company achieves specified long-term performance goals over a three-year period. The Company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock. The total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates. The Company reviews our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter. If achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable, previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement. If we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment, additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively. 49 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2012 Highlights Operating cash flow $315.1 million vs. $336.3 million in fiscal 2011. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) $99.8 million vs. $103.7 million in fiscal 2011. Cash payments for acquisitions totaled $145.3 million vs. $58.0 million in fiscal 2011. Total debt decreased to $373.7 million at the end of fiscal 2012 from $380.4 million at the end of fiscal 2011. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 12.8 $ 5.2 Total assets $ 2,941.4 $ 2,624.5 Working capital $ 395.3 $ 273.1 Total debt $ 373.7 $ 380.4 Stockholders equity $ 2,213.2 $ 1,937.5 Ratio of debt to equity 0.17:1 0.20:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 14 % 16 % Working Capital The increase in working capital at the end of fiscal 2012 from the end of fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases in inventory, accounts receivable, cash and other current assets and the decrease in short-term debt. This increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. The $66.6 million increase in inventory was primarily due to increased production to support new product launches and the re-launch of Avaira Toric contact lenses, as well as $8.5 million in inventory related to the acquisition of Origio. At October 31, 2012, our inventory months on hand (MOH) were 6.7 representing an increase from 5.5 at October 31, 2011, or 5.9 after excluding the reserve for inventory related to the recall in fiscal 2011. The $19.5 million increase in trade accounts receivable was primarily due to timing of collections as well as the acquisition of Origio. Our days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 54 days at October 31, 2012, from 55 days in the prior year period. We have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company presently intends to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the United States of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment requirements. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow provided by operating activities continued in fiscal 2012 as Cooper major source of liquidity at $315.1 million compared to $336.3 million in fiscal 2011 and $267.7 million in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2012 net income increased $73.2 million from the prior year to $248.6 million and our results include $116.4 million of non-cash items primarily related to depreciation and amortization, $21.5 million related to share-based compensation and $5.0 million related to currency translation. Results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities, excluding those acquired from Origio, which primarily reflected the increases in 50 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations inventories of $58.1 million and trade accounts receivable of $5.0 million. The $21.2 million decrease in cash flow provided by operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is due to the recognition in fiscal 2011 of non-cash items, primarily the loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.5 million and the accrued litigation settlement of $10.0 million, as well as the fiscal 2012 increase in inventory and decrease in accrued expenses. For fiscal 2012, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products. Our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of $10.6 million and $15.8 million for interest and income tax, respectively, and the $10.0 million single lump-sum payment, accrued in fiscal 2011, to settle the Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. lawsuit under the agreement reached on December 2, 2011. For fiscal 2011, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products. Our primary uses of cash flows provided by operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of $25.6 million and $12.2 million for interest and income tax, respectively. Investing Cash Flow Cash used in investing activities of $238.5 million in fiscal 2012 was for capital expenditures of $99.8 million, primarily to increase manufacturing capacity, and payments of $145.3 million related to acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Origio, partially offset by the $6.6 million insurance recovery related to facility repairs. Cash used in investing activities of $161.7 million in fiscal 2011 was for capital expenditures of $103.7 million, primarily to improve manufacturing efficiency, and payments of $58.0 million related to acquisitions. Financing Cash Flow The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments of debt as well as share-based compensation awards and share repurchases. Cash used in financing activities of $68.4 million in fiscal 2012 was driven by $56.7 million for net repayments of debt, including repayment of debt acquired with Origio, and $71.2 million in payments for share repurchases under our share repurchase plan together with dividends paid on our common stock of $2.8 million, $2.2 million to purchase Origio shares from noncontrolling interests and a $1.3 million payment for contingent consideration. Cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $55.1 million from the exercise of share-based compensation awards and $10.7 million for the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements. In fiscal 2011, the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily related to borrowings and payments of debt and share-based compensation awards. Cash used in financing activities of $172.9 million in fiscal 2011 was driven by net repayments of debt of $242.8 million, including the redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes and the related redemption premium, acquisition costs related to the Credit Agreement of $9.6 million, a $2.6 million payment for contingent consideration and dividends paid on our common stock of $2.8 million, offset by proceeds of $82.0 million from the exercise of share-based compensation awards and $2.9 million for the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements. At October 31, 2012, we had $653.7 million available under the Credit Agreement, and we are in compliance with our financial covenants including the Interest Coverage Ratio at 37.21 to 1.00 and the Total Leverage Ratio at 0.85 to 1.00. As defined in the Credit Agreement, the Interest Coverage Ratio is the ratio of Consolidated Proforma EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense with the requirement to be at least 3.00 51 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to 1.00 and the Total Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated Proforma EBITDA with the requirement to remain below 3.75 to 1.00. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2012, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total 2013 2014 & 2015 2016 & 2017 2018 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 348.4 $ 0.1 $ 0.8 $ 347.1 $ 0.4 Interest payments 27.2 7.3 11.8 8.0 0.1 Operating leases 134.6 19.9 33.3 25.2 56.2 Redemption of remaining outstanding shares of Origio 2.6 2.6 Consideration for marketing rights 6.3 3.8 2.5 Total contractual obligations 519.1 33.7 48.4 380.3 56.7 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 2.7 2.7 Total $ 521.8 $ 36.4 $ 48.4 $ 380.3 $ 56.7 The expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2022 are disclosed in Note 9. Employee Benefits. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, such amounts of our long-term income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above. However, other long-term liabilities, included in our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions. For additional information, please see Note 5. Income Taxes. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years. New Accounting Pronouncements On November 1, 2011, the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-29, Business Combinations: Disclosure of Supplementary Proforma Information for Business Combinations, which amends ASC 805, Business Combinations . The amendments in this ASU affect any public entity as defined by ASC 805 that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. The amendments in this ASU specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments also expand the supplemental proforma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring proforma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in 52 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the reported proforma revenue and earnings. The amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. As this guidance only requires enhanced disclosures, its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On November 1, 2011, the Company adopted the provisions of the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts, which amends ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other . The amendments in this ASU modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. On November 1, 2011, the Company adopted the provisions of the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment . ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test as described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other . The ASU defines the more-likely-than-not threshold as having a likelihood of more than 50%. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The early adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. On July 31, 2012, the Company early adopted the provisions of the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment . ASU 2012-02 states that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount. The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income . This accounting standard (1) eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity; (2) requires the consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income; and (3) requires an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income. The amendments in this ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income nor do the amendments affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation 53 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 , which defers the requirement within ASU 2011-05 to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented. During the deferral, entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect prior to the issuance of ASU 2011-05. The amendments made by these ASUs should be applied retrospectively and become effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of these ASUs, which are effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2012, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition - We recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns, and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. As required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller's price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CooperSurgical medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs when title and risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. The Company records taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales. Net realizable value of inventory - In assessing the value of inventories, we make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability. We reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market, resulting in a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, five to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and women's healthcare product portfolios. 54 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Valuation of goodwill - We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards. We performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2012, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. We performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2011 and concluded that we had no impairment of goodwill in that year. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments - CooperVision and CooperSurgical - reflecting the way that we manage our business. In fiscal 2012, we performed a qualitative assessment to test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test will be performed. In fiscal 2011, the fair value of our reporting units was determined using the income valuation approach. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. In the application of the income approach, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital. We used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units, with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy. The discount rates used in fiscal 2011 were about 100 basis points lower than those used in our analysis for fiscal 2010 reflecting the then current condition of the United States and global economy. The Company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near-term net sales expectations and long-term projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports. As a sensitivity analysis, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2011 and extending through the valuation period, for fiscal 2011, would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. Goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, the Company may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of its goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders' equity and financial condition. Business combinations - We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. We recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including 55 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree generally at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. As of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Income taxes - We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. Regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. We measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes. The interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our Consolidated Statement of Income and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense. Share-Based Compensation - The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance unit shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Under fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper's stock price volatility, employee exercise behaviors and related employee forfeiture rates. The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. In determining the expected volatility, management 56 THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company's stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant. As share-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period. 57
