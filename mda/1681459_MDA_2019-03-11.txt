ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global leader in oil and gas projects, technologies, systems and services. We have manufacturing operations worldwide, strategically located to facilitate efficient delivery of these products, technologies, systems and services to our customers. We report our results of operations in the following segments: Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. Management determination of the Company reporting segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities and corresponds to the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resource allocations to each segment. A description of our products and services and annual financial data for each segment can be found in Part I, Item 1, Business and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations of each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 follows. We focus on economic- and industry-specific drivers and key risk factors affecting our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources. The results of our segments are primarily driven by changes in capital spending by oil and gas companies, which largely depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas demand, production volumes, and consequently, commodity prices. We use crude oil and natural gas prices as an indicator of demand. Additionally, we use both onshore and offshore rig count as an indicator of demand, which consequently influences the level of worldwide production activity and spending decisions. We also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for capital allocation. These factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook, product obsolescence and the competitive environment. We address these risks in our business strategies, which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies and cultivating strong customer relationships. Our Subsea segment is affected by changes in commodity prices and trends in deepwater oil and natural gas production. Our Onshore/Offshore segment is impacted by change in commodity prices, population growth and demand for natural gas, although the onshore market is typically more resilient to these changes impacting the segment. Our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments both benefit from the current market fundamentals supporting the demand for new liquefied natural gas facilities. Onshore/Offshore also benefits from the construction of petrochemical and fertilizer plants. Our Surface Technologies segment is primarily affected by changes in commodity prices and trends in land-based and shallow water oil and natural gas production, including trends in shale production. We have developed close working relationships with our customers. Our results reflect our ability to build long-term alliances with oil and natural gas companies and to provide solutions for their needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that by closely working with our customers, we enhance our competitive advantage, improve our operating results and strengthen our market positions. As we evaluate our operating results, we consider business segment performance indicators like segment revenue, operating profit and capital employed, in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog. A significant proportion of our revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Cash receipts from such arrangements typically occur at milestones achieved under stated contract terms. Consequently, the timing of revenue recognition is not always correlated with the timing of customer payments. We aim to structure our contracts to receive advance payments that we typically use to fund engineering efforts and inventory purchases. Working capital (excluding cash) and net (debt) cash are therefore key performance indicators of cash flows. In each of our segments, we serve customers from around the world. During 2018 , approximately 90% of our total sales were recognized outside of the United States. We evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our technological capabilities and strategies. 40 BUSINESS OUTLOOK Overall Outlook - Following the steep decline from prior years, the price of crude oil has been on a gradual upward trend since the cyclical trough experienced in early 2016, though the price of crude oil remains quite volatile. In addition, the sustainability of the price recovery and business activity levels is dependent on several variables, including geopolitical stability, OPEC actions to regulate its production capacity, changes in demand patterns, and international sanctions and tariffs. However, as long-term demand is forecast to rise and base production continues to naturally decline, we believe the macroeconomic backdrop will provide our customers with greater confidence to increase their investments in new sources of oil and natural gas production. Subsea - The impact of the low crude oil price environment over the last three years led many of our customers to reduce their capital spending plans and defer new offshore projects. Through this period, we have lowered our cost base through reductions in workforce as well as in manufacturing. This has helped align our operations with the anticipated reductions in activity in order to mitigate some of the negative impact to our operating profit. We have been realizing the benefits from restructuring actions through greater cost efficiency, most notably in our manufacturing operations. We have taken additional actions in 2018, but we have balanced further reductions with the need to preserve capacity in preparation for increased market activity and higher order inbound as industry conditions continue to improve. The operational improvements we have made through the downturn are providing us with the capability to respond to an increase in order activity despite the reductions in both personnel and manufacturing capacity. However, the subsea industry continues to have both underutilized manufacturing and vessel capacity, which may lead to continued pricing pressure. We also recognize the need to further develop and invest in our people to ensure we have the core competencies and capabilities necessary for continued success during the market recovery. Our lowered cost base combined with the aggressive cost reductions taken by our customers has caused project economics to improve. Many current and future offshore projects are deemed to be economic at prices below those experienced in the third quarter. While customer investment decisions can be delayed for a variety of reasons, we continue to work closely with our customers through early engagement in (FEED) studies and the use of our unique integrated approach to subsea development (iEPCI) to allow more project final investment decisions through the cycle. iEPCI can support clients initiatives to improve subsea project economics by helping to reduce cost and accelerate time to first oil. In the long term, we continue to believe that offshore and deepwater developments will remain a significant part of our customers portfolios. Onshore/Offshore - Onshore market activity continues to provide a tangible set of opportunities, particularly for natural gas monetization projects, as natural gas continues to take a larger share of global energy demand. Market conditions for liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) have improved as rising demand continues to rebalance an oversupplied market. This is driving an improved outlook for our business, and we are confident that the pace of LNG investments will continue to grow in the near and intermediate term. As an industry leader, we are well positioned for the growth in new liquefaction and regasification capacity and are actively engaged in several LNG FEED studies across multiple geographies. These FEED studies provide a platform for early engagement with clients and can significantly de-risk project execution while also supporting our pursuit of the engineering, procurement and construction ( EPC ) contract. Additionally, we continue to selectively pursue refining, petrochemical, and fertilizer project opportunities in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and North American markets. Surface Technologies - After a period of rapid growth, the North America unconventional market is undergoing near-term volatility. While drilling activity has proved to be resilient, completions activity has been reduced, stemming from pipeline take-away capacity constraints and exhaustion of operator capital budgets for exploration and production. Hydraulic fracturing activity has slowed sequentially, particularly in the Permian basin through 2018. These constraints should prove to be transitory, though, as operator budgets renew and pipeline take-away capacity improves and we expect improvement in activity in the second half of 2019. Despite the near-term volatility, we are continuing to introduce new, innovative commercial models in North America. Activity in our surface business outside of North America has been more resilient but continues to experience pressure from competitive pricing; however, growth prospects for these markets are expected to improve further in 2019. 41 Pro Forma Results of Operations Unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 present consolidated information as if (i) the Merger and (ii) the consolidation of legal onshore/offshore contract entities that own and account for the design, engineering and construction of the Yamal had been completed as of January 1, 2016. The pro forma results do not include any potential synergies, cost savings or other expected benefits of these transactions. Accordingly, the pro forma results should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the transactions had been consummated as of January 1, 2016, nor are they indicative of future results. Refer to Note 2 and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger and Yamal, respectively. Due to the size of the aforementioned transactions relative to the size of historical results of operations and for purposes of comparability, management discussion of the consolidated and segment results of operations are provided on the basis of comparing actual results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 to pro forma results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Actual results for the year ended December 31, 2016 represent Technip only. 42 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, Change (In millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 Pro Forma* 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma Revenue $ 12,552.9 $ 15,056.9 $ 19,068.8 $ 9,199.6 $ (2,504.0 ) (16.6 )% $ (4,011.9 ) (21)% Costs and expenses Cost of sales 10,273.0 12,524.6 16,382.5 7,630.0 (2,251.6 ) (18.0 )% (3,857.9 ) (24)% Selling, general and administrative expense 1,140.6 1,060.9 1,229.9 572.6 79.7 7.5 % (169.0 ) (14)% Research and development expense 189.2 212.9 219.5 105.4 (23.7 ) (11.1 )% (6.6 ) (3)% Impairment, restructuring and other expense 1,831.2 191.5 443.6 343.0 1,639.7 856.2 % (252.1 ) (57)% Merger transaction and integration costs 36.5 101.8 137.8 92.6 (65.3 ) (64.1 )% (36.0 ) (26)% Total costs and expenses 13,470.5 14,091.7 18,413.3 8,743.6 (621.2 ) (4.4 )% (4,321.6 ) (23)% Other income (expense), net (323.9 ) (25.9 ) 12.1 6.5 (298.0 ) (1,150.6 )% (38.0 ) (314)% Income from equity affiliates 114.3 55.6 10.9 117.7 58.7 105.6 % 44.7 410% Net interest expense (360.9 ) (315.2 ) (29.1 ) (28.8 ) (45.7 ) (14.5 )% (286.1 ) (983)% Income (loss) before income taxes (1,488.1 ) 679.7 649.4 551.4 (2,167.8 ) (318.9 )% 30.3 5% Provision for income taxes 422.7 545.5 284.7 180.3 (122.8 ) (22.5 )% 260.8 92% Income (loss) from continuing operations (1,910.8 ) 134.2 364.7 371.1 (2,045.0 ) (1,523.8 )% (230.5 ) (63)% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (10.1 ) % 10.1 100% Net income (loss) (1,910.8 ) 134.2 354.6 371.1 (2,045.0 ) (1,523.8 )% (220.4 ) (62)% Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests (10.8 ) (20.9 ) 23.6 22.2 10.1 48.3 % (44.5 ) (189)% Net income (loss) attributable to TechnipFMC plc $ (1,921.6 ) $ 113.3 $ 378.2 $ 393.3 $ (2,034.9 ) (1,796.0 )% $ (264.9 ) (70)% * Refer to Pro Forma Results of Operations above for further information related to the presentation of and transactions included in pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 2016. 2018 Compared With 2017 Revenue Revenue decreased $2.5 billion in 2018 compared to the prior-year period, primarily as a result of declining project activity. Subsea project activity declined in Africa, Asia Pacific, and North America. Onshore/Offshore activity also declined as projects progressed towards completion, driven primarily by Yamal LNG, partially offset by an increase in project activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Surface Technologies revenue increased primarily as a result of strong demand for the North American land market recovery. Gross profit Gross profit (revenue less cost of sales) increased as a percentage of sales to 18.2% in 2018 , from 16.8% in the prior-year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the realization of cost reduction opportunities on certain projects, a lower overall cost structure due to cost reduction and synergy initiatives, the successful progression of several major projects with strong economic performance, and the benefit of a better product and service mix. 43 Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expense increased $79.7 million year-over-year. FMC Technologies operations prior to the Merger date of January, 17, 2017 is excluded from 2017. FMC Technologies' selling, general and administrative expenses for this period were $63.0 million. On a comparable basis, selling, general and administrative expense increased by $16.7 million, primarily due to increased tendering costs related to an increasing number of FEED studies and future project awards. Impairment, restructuring and other expense We incurred impairment, restructuring and other expense of $1.8 billion primarily driven by a $1.4 billion impairment of goodwill and $372.9 million impairment of our vessels. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to impairments. Merger transaction and integration costs We incurred integration costs of $36.5 million during 2018 . Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Merger. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, primarily reflects $280.0 million in legal provisions and $116.5 million of net foreign exchange losses associated with the remeasurement of net cash positions and foreign currency derivatives. Net interest expense During the year ended December 31, 2018 , we revalued the mandatorily redeemable financial liability to reflect current expectations about the obligation and recognized a loss of $322.3 million . Refer to Note 22 for further information regarding the fair value measurement assumptions of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability and related changes in its fair value. Net interest expense, excluding the fair value measurement of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability, also includes interest income and expenses, which were higher by $17.2 million on a net basis compared to 2017. Provision for income taxes The effective tax rate was (28.4)% in 2018 and 80.3% in 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was significantly impacted by impairments which were only partially tax-effective and non-deductible legal provision. The change in the effective tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017, excluding these items, was primarily attributable to an unfavorable change in actual country mix of earnings. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Revenue Revenue decreased $4.0 billion in 2017 compared to the prior-year period on a pro forma basis, primarily resulting from a sharp decline in Subsea activities in the Europe and Africa region due to lower order activity during 2015 and 2016, resulting in a lower backlog of business coming into 2017. The decrease was also attributable to the completion of several projects, combined with lower Subsea vessel utilization. Revenue also decreased across all Onshore/Offshore businesses year-over-year on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by lower levels of project backlog coming into 2017 for the Middle East, North America, and South America regions. Gross profit Gross profit (revenue less cost of sales) increased as a percentage of sales to 16.8% in 2017, from 14.1% in the prior-year on a pro forma basis. The improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the reduction of cost of sales year-over-year on a pro forma basis as a result of the realization of cost reduction opportunities on certain projects, a lower overall cost structure due to cost reduction and synergy initiatives, the successful progression of several major projects with strong economic performance, and the benefit of a better product and service mix. 44 Selling, general and administrative expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $169.0 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis, resulting from lower headcount across all reporting segments, due in part to the benefit of Merger synergies and decreased sales commissions due to the reduced revenue. Impairment, restructuring and other expense Impairment, restructuring and other expense decreased by $252.1 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Impairment, restructuring and other expense for 2017 included $157.2 million of restructuring expense and $34.3 million of impairment expense. In the comparable periods, on a pro forma basis, we have implemented restructuring plans across our segments to reduce costs and better align our workforce with anticipated activity levels. Thus, we previously incurred significant restructuring expenses in 2016 on a pro forma basis. In 2017 we continued to align our capacity to expected operating activity levels for 2018 and beyond and we were also negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey, as a result of which we incurred expenses of $10.9 million due to lost productivity. Merger transaction and integration costs We incurred merger transaction and integration costs of $101.8 million during 2017 due to the Merger. A significant portion of the expenses recorded in the period are related to transaction and leased facility termination fees, with a lower portion but still material related to integration activities pertaining to combining the two legacy companies. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net, primarily reflects foreign currency gains and losses. These include gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of net cash positions as well as foreign currency derivatives. During 2017, we incurred $40.1 million of additional net foreign exchange losses compared to 2016. Net interest expense The increase in interest expense was due to the changes in the fair value of a mandatorily redeemable financial liability. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we revalued the liability to reflect current expectations about the obligation and recognized a loss of $293.7 million . Refer to Note 22 for further information regarding the fair value measurement assumptions of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability and related changes in its fair value. Provision for income taxes Our income tax provisions for 2017 and 2016 on a historical basis reflected effective tax rates of 80.3% and 32.7%, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in our valuation allowance due to additional losses generated during the year for which no tax benefit is expected to be realized and an unfavorable change in actual country mix of earnings. In addition, due to U.S. legislation passed in the fourth quarter of 2017, we incurred a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax of $148.7 million and an unfavorable tax provision impact of $18.9 million from the revaluation of the U.S. deferred individual tax assets and liabilities. 45 OPERATING RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS Segment operating profit is defined as total segment revenue less segment operating expenses. Certain items have been excluded in computing segment operating profit and are included in corporate items. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. We report our results of operations in U.S. dollars; however, our earnings are generated in various currencies worldwide. In order to provide worldwide consolidated results, the earnings of subsidiaries functioning in their local currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based upon the average exchange rate during the period. While the U.S. dollar results reported reflect the actual economics of the period reported upon, the variances from prior periods include the impact of translating earnings at different rates.

(a) Due to the Merger, there were 11.5 months included in the year ended 2017 for legacy FMC Technologies, compared with twelve months in pro forma 2016. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. 2018 Compared With 2017 Subsea revenue decreased $1.0 billion year-over-year, primarily due to projects in Africa, Asia Pacific and North America regions that progressed towards completion, partially offset by increased activity in Europe. Subsea revenue continued to be negatively impacted by prior period lower inbound orders related to the market downturn. Subsea operating profit, excluding $1,784.2 million of asset impairment charges, totaled $254.7 million, compared to the prior-year operating profit of $460.5 million . The reduction was primarily due to the anticipated revenue decline related to the prior period lower inbound orders, partially offset by Merger synergies and other cost reduction activities, and the successful completion of key project milestones. Additionally, 2018 included $1,784.2 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and certain of our vessels. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to these asset impairments. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures for further information regarding our segment operating results. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Subsea revenue decreased $3.3 billion year-over-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to lower overall activity in the Europe, Africa and North America regions as a result of the reduced backlog from 2015 and 2016. Additionally, the decrease in revenue was attributable to the completion of several projects during the first nine months of 2017 and lower vessel utilization year-over-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to high vessel campaigns in Africa and Asia in the prior year that did not continue into the current year at similar levels. Subsea operating profit as a percent of revenue decreased year-over-year on a pro forma basis due to lower revenue in our Subsea projects business across most Subsea regions. 46 Onshore/Offshore Year Ended December 31, Favorable/(Unfavorable) (In millions, except %) 2018 2017 2016 Pro Forma 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma Revenue $ 6,120.7 $ 7,904.5 $ 8,690.0 $ 3,349.1 $ (1,783.8 ) (23)% $ (785.5 ) (9)% Operating profit $ 824.0 $ 810.9 $ 184.5 $ 34.1 $ 13.1 2% $ 626.4 340% Operating profit as a percent of revenue 13.5 % 10.3 % 2.1 % 1.0 % 3.2 pts. 8.2 pts. 2018 Compared With 2017 Onshore/Offshore revenue decreased $1.8 billion year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by major projects including Yamal LNG, Silbur, and Martin Linge, that progressed towards completion. The decrease was partially offset by the Energean Karish project awarded in early 2018, FEED work for the Arctic LNG project, and increased work in our Process and Technology business. Operating profit year-over-year was favorably impacted by reduced costs, strong project execution and bonus achievements on Yamal LNG due to completion of key milestones ahead of schedule. Additionally, 2018 was favorably impacted by $3.4 million related to settlements on restructured projects and operations. Onshore/Offshore operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 13.5% compared to 2017. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures for further information regarding our segment operating results. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Onshore/Offshore revenue decreased $785.5 million year-over-year. The decrease in revenue was attributable to lower activity in North America, due to the delivery of several projects in 2016 and early 2017, as well as reduced activity in Yamal, partially offset by increases projects in Prelude FLNG and the Middle East. Operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended 2017 were both favorable compared to the year ended 2016 on a pro forma basis in comparison and both benefited by successful progression of several major projects, including Yamal and Prelude FLNG, and the successful resolution of certain contract disputes. In addition, the year-over-year performances were favorably impacted by a decrease of $209.7 million related to impairment, restructuring and other expense. Surface Technologies (b) Year Ended December 31, Favorable/(Unfavorable) (In millions, except %) 2018 2017 (a) 2016 Pro Forma 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma Revenue $ 1,592.2 $ 1,274.6 $ 1,252.2 $ 317.6 25% $ 22.4 2% Operating profit (loss) $ 172.8 $ 82.7 $ (122.0 ) $ 90.1 109% $ 204.7 168% Operating profit (loss) as a percent of revenue 10.9 % 6.5 % (9.7 )% 4.4 pts. 16.2 pts. (a) Due to the Merger, there were 11.5 months included in the year ended 2017 for legacy FMC Technologies, compared with twelve months in pro forma 2016. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (b) Prior to the Merger, we reported our business in two segments, Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. As a result of the Merger and the addition of FMC Technologies, we began reporting our business in three segments. As such, actual results of operations for 2016 do not include Surface Technologies. 47 2018 Compared With 2017 Surface Technologies revenue increased $317.6 million year-over-year primarily driven by increased activity in the North American market. The solid growth in North America reflected increased demand for flowline, hydraulic fracturing services, wellhead systems, and pressure control equipment and services. Outside of North America, revenue also increased year-over-year primarily driven by increased demand for pressure control equipment and services. Surface Technologies operating profit as a percent of revenue increased significantly year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by increased volume in North America and cost reductions, partially offset by continued international pricing pressure. Additionally, 2018 included $13.8 million of impairment and restructuring and other severance charges compared to $19.2 million in the prior year. Surface Technologies operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 10.9% compared to 2017. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures for further information regarding our segment operating results. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Surface Technologies revenue increased $22.4 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Lower revenue in our surface international, measurement solutions, and loading systems businesses year-over-year on a pro forma basis was more than offset by revenue increase in our surface Americas business. The increase for surface Americas was driven primarily by a higher rig count, which had a positive impact on our flowline and well service pump revenues. Surface Technologies operating profit as a percent of revenue increased year-over-year on a pro forma basis and was driven primarily by increased volume in flowline and well service pump products in our surface Americas business, and a $48.8 million decrease in impairment, restructuring and other severance charges. Corporate Items Year Ended December 31, Favorable/(Unfavorable) (In millions, except %) 2018 2017 2016 Pro Forma 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Pro Forma Corporate expense $ (594.5 ) $ (359.2 ) $ (366.6 ) $ (185.9 ) $ (235.3 ) (66)% $ 7.4 2% 2018 Compared With 2017 Corporate expense increased by $235.3 million year-over-year. The increase is due primarily to a legal provision of $280.0 million recorded in 2018. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Offsetting the increase was $65.3 million less integration costs and $24.4 million less restructuring costs than in 2017. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures for further information regarding our segment operating results. 2017 Compared With 2016 Pro Forma Corporate expense decreased by $7.4 million year-over-year on a pro forma basis. The decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of business combination transaction and integration costs of $34.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016 on a pro forma basis. 48 NON-GAAP MEASURES In addition to financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we provide non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) below. Net income, excluding charges and credits, as well as measures derived from it (excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes, excluding charges and credits ("Adjusted Operating profit"); Depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits ("Adjusted EBITDA"); and net cash) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period, and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of the most comparable financial measures under GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures. Year Ended December 31, 2018 Subsea Onshore/ Offshore Surface Technologies Corporate and Other Total Revenue $ 4,840.0 $ 6,120.7 $ 1,592.2 $ $ 12,552.9 Operating profit (loss), as reported (pre-tax) $ (1,529.5 ) $ 824.0 $ 172.8 $ (594.5 ) $ (1,127.2 ) Charges and (credits): Impairment and other charges 1,784.2 4.5 3.9 1,792.6 Restructuring and other severance charges 17.7 (3.4 ) 9.3 15.0 38.6 Business combination transaction and integration costs 36.5 36.5 Legal provision 280.0 280.0 Gain on divestitures (3.3 ) (28.3 ) (31.6 ) Purchase price accounting adjustments - non-amortization related (9.4 ) 7.1 (0.2 ) (2.5 ) Purchase price accounting adjustments - amortization related 91.3 91.3 Subtotal 1,880.5 (31.7 ) 20.9 335.2 2,204.9 Adjusted Operating profit (loss) 351.0 792.3 193.7 (259.3 ) 1,077.7 Adjusted Depreciation and amortization 349.2 38.1 66.6 5.2 459.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 700.2 $ 830.4 $ 260.3 $ (254.1 ) $ 1,536.8 Operating profit margin (31.6 )% 13.5 % 10.9 % (9.0 )% Adjusted Operating profit margin 7.3 % 12.9 % 12.2 % 8.6 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 14.5 % 13.6 % 16.3 % 12.2 % 49 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Subsea Onshore/ Offshore Surface Technologies Corporate and Other Total Revenue $ 5,877.4 $ 7,904.5 $ 1,274.6 $ 0.4 $ 15,056.9 Operating profit (loss), as reported (pre-tax) $ 460.5 $ 810.9 $ 82.7 $ (359.2 ) $ 994.9 Charges and (credits): Impairment and other charges 11.5 10.2 12.6 34.3 Restructuring and other severance charges 88.4 27.0 9.0 32.8 157.2 Business combination transaction and integration costs 101.8 101.8 Change in accounting estimate 11.8 10.1 21.9 Purchase price accounting adjustments - non-amortization related 40.5 43.3 (25.6 ) 58.2 Purchase price accounting adjustments - amortization related 139.2 12.4 (1.2 ) 150.4 Subtotal 291.4 27.0 85.0 120.4 523.8 Adjusted Operating profit (loss) 751.9 837.9 167.7 (238.8 ) 1,518.7 Adjusted Depreciation and amortization 368.0 41.1 51.1 4.1 464.3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,119.9 $ 879.0 $ 218.8 $ (234.7 ) $ 1,983.0 Operating profit margin 7.8 % 10.3 % 6.5 % 6.6 % Adjusted Operating profit margin 12.8 % 10.6 % 13.2 % 10.1 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 19.1 % 11.1 % 17.2 % 13.2 % 50 INBOUND ORDERS AND ORDER BACKLOG Inbound orders - Inbound orders represent the estimated sales value of confirmed customer orders received during the reporting period. Inbound Orders Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Subsea $ 5,178.5 $ 5,143.6 Onshore/Offshore 7,425.9 3,812.9 Surface Technologies 1,686.6 1,239.8 Total inbound orders $ 14,291.0 $ 10,196.3 Order backlog - Order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled, confirmed customer orders at the reporting date. See Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligations in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on order backlog. Order Backlog December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 Subsea $ 5,999.6 $ 6,203.9 Onshore/Offshore 8,090.5 6,369.1 Surface Technologies 469.9 409.8 Total order backlog $ 14,560.0 $ 12,982.8 Subsea - Order backlog for Subsea at December 31, 2018, decreased by $204.3 million from December 31, 2017 . Subsea backlog of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2018, was composed of various subsea projects, including Petrobras pipelay support vessel and pre-salt tree awards; the Eni Coral project; Total Kaombo; VNG Fenja; Peregrino Phase II; and BP Shah Deniz. Onshore/Offshore - Onshore/Offshore order backlog at December 31, 2018, increased by $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2017 . Onshore/Offshore backlog of $8.1 billion was composed of various projects, including Yamal; Long Son EPC contract, Energean Karish project, HURL Ammonia fertilizer projects, and Neste bio-diesel expansion project in Singapore. Non-consolidated backlog - Non-consolidated backlog reflects the proportional share of backlog related to joint ventures that is not consolidated due to our minority ownership position. Non-consolidated backlog (In millions) December 31, 2018 Subsea $ 974.0 Onshore/Offshore 1,748.5 Total order backlog $ 2,722.5 51 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Most of our cash is managed centrally and flowed through centralized bank accounts controlled and maintained by TechnipFMC in the US and in other jurisdictions to best meet the liquidity needs of our global operations. Under current U.S. law, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, any repatriation to the U.S. in the form of a dividend would be eligible for a 100% dividend received deduction and therefore would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We expect to meet the continuing funding requirements of our global operations with cash generated by such operations, our commercial paper programs, and our existing revolving credit facility. Net (Debt) Cash - Net (debt) cash, is a non-GAAP financial measure reflecting cash and cash equivalents, net of debt. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our capital structure and financial leverage. We believe net debt, or net cash, is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding our financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in our capital structure. Net (debt) cash should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash and cash equivalents as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. The following table provides a reconciliation of our cash and cash equivalents to net (debt) cash, utilizing details of classifications from our consolidated balance sheets. (In millions) December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,540.0 $ 6,737.4 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt (67.4 ) (77.1 ) Long-term debt, less current portion (4,124.3 ) (3,777.9 ) Net cash $ 1,348.3 $ 2,882.4 Cash Flows Cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 , were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2018 2017 2016 Cash provided (required) by operating activities $ (185.4 ) $ 210.7 $ 493.8 Cash provided (required) by investing activities (460.2 ) 1,250.0 3,110.5 Cash required by financing activities (444.8 ) (1,054.8 ) (534.6 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (107.0 ) 62.2 21.6 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,197.4 ) $ 468.1 $ 3,091.3 Working capital $ (759.0 ) $ (725.2 ) $ (142.7 ) Operating cash flows - During 2018 , we used $185.4 million in cash flows from operating activities as compared to $210.7 million generated in 2017 , resulting in a $396.1 million decrease compared to 2017 . Our cash flows from operating activities in 2017 were $283.1 million lower than 2016 . Our working capital balances can vary significantly depending on the payment and delivery terms on key contracts in our portfolio of projects. The year-over-year changes in operating cash flow were primarily due to the changes in trade receivables, net and contract assets and accounts payable, trade. Investing cash flows - Investing activities used $460.2 million of cash in 2018 primarily due to capital expenditures of $368.1 million and business acquisitions of $104.9 million . Cash provided by investing activities in 2017 was $1,250.0 million , primarily reflecting cash acquired in the Merger. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the Merger. 52 Cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was $3,110.5 million , primarily reflecting cash acquired through an acquisition. Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to the acquisition and consolidation of legal onshore/offshore contract entities that own and account for Yamal. Financing cash flows - Financing activities used $444.8 million in 2018 . The decrease of $610.0 million in cash required for financing activities was primarily due to repayments of long-term debt in 2017 . Financing activities used $1,054.8 million in 2017 . The increase of $520.2 million in cash required for financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2016, an increase in settlements on mandatorily redeemable liability, and an increase in payments of taxes withheld on share-based compensation, offset by increased borrowings of our commercial paper during 2017 . Debt and Liquidity Total borrowings at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , comprised the following: (In millions) December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Revolving credit facility $ $ Bilateral credit facilities Commercial paper 1,916.1 1,450.4 Synthetic bonds due 2021 490.9 502.4 3.45% Senior Notes due 2022 500.0 500.0 5.00% Notes due 2020 229.0 239.9 3.40% Notes due 2022 171.8 179.9 3.15% Notes due 2023 148.9 155.9 3.15% Notes due 2023 143.1 149.9 4.00% Notes due 2027 85.9 89.9 4.00% Notes due 2032 114.5 119.9 3.75% Notes due 2033 114.5 119.9 Bank borrowings 265.2 332.5 Other 23.2 28.2 Unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts (11.4 ) (13.8 ) Total borrowings $ 4,191.7 $ 3,855.0 The following is a summary of our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018 : (In millions) Description Amount Debt Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding (a) Letters of Credit Unused Capacity Maturity Five-year revolving credit facility $ 2,500.0 $ $ 1,916.1 $ $ 583.9 January 2023 (a) Under our commercial paper program, we have the ability to access up to $1.5 billion and 1.0 billion of financing through our commercial paper dealers. Our available capacity under our revolving credit facility is reduced by any outstanding commercial paper. Committed credit available under our revolving credit facility provides the ability to issue our commercial paper obligations on a long-term basis. We had $1,916.1 million of commercial paper issued under our facilities at December 31, 2018. As we had both the ability and intent to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis, our commercial paper borrowings were classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018. 53 Our revolving credit facility contains customary covenants as defined by the credit facility agreement which includes a financial covenant requiring that our total capitalization ratio not exceed 60% at the end of any financial quarter. The facility agreement also contains covenants restricting our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional liens and indebtedness, enter into asset sales, make certain investments. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 13 and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to our credit facility and our mandatorily redeemable liability, respectively. Credit Risk Analysis Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the fair value of the instruments, including the values associated with counterparty risk. These values must also take into account our credit standing, thus including in the valuation of the derivative instrument and the value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract. Our methodology includes the impact of both counterparty and our own credit standing. Adjustments to our derivative assets and liabilities related to credit risk were not material for any period presented. We use the income approach as the valuation technique to measure the fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments on a recurring basis. This approach calculates the present value of the future cash flow by measuring the change from the derivative contract rate and the published market indicative currency rate, multiplied by the contract notional values. Credit risk is then incorporated by reducing the derivative fair value in asset positions by the result of multiplying the present value of the portfolio by the counterparty published credit spread. Portfolios in a liability position are adjusted by the same calculation; however, a spread representing our credit spread is used. Our credit spread, and the credit spread of other counterparties not publicly available are approximated by using the spread of similar companies in the same industry, of similar size and with the same credit rating. At this time, we have no credit-risk-related contingent features in our agreements with the financial institutions that would require us to post collateral for derivative positions in a liability position . Additional information about credit risk is incorporated herein by reference to Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Outlook Historically, we have generated our liquidity and capital resources primarily through operations and, when needed, through our credit facility. We have $583.9 million of capacity available under our revolving credit facility that we expect to utilize if working capital needs temporarily increase. The volatility in credit, equity and commodity markets creates some uncertainty for our business. Any payment deferrals or discounts on pricing granted to clients in prior years may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in 2019 and beyond. We project spending approximately $350 million in 2019 for capital expenditures. However, projected capital expenditures for 2019 do not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award. We implemented a U.K. court-approved reduction of our capital, which was completed on June 29, 2017, in order to create distributable profits to support the payment of future dividends or future share repurchases. Our board of directors authorized $500 million for the repurchase of shares which was completed in 2018. The Board of Directors authorized an extension of this program, adding $300 million in December 2018 for a total of $800 million in ordinary shares. Also, on October 23, 2018, it was announced that our Board of Directors authorized and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per ordinary share. During 2019 , we expect to make contributions of approximately $2.7 million to our international pension plans, representing primarily the Netherlands qualified pension plans and U.K. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. We update our pension estimates annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan and our U.S. Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan in 2019 . 54 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 : Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total payments Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Debt (a) $ 4,191.7 $ 67.4 $ 2,854.2 $ 962.9 $ 307.2 Interest on debt (a) 394.8 60.6 121.1 93.7 119.4 Operating leases (b) 1,519.7 329.8 478.4 225.9 485.6 Purchase obligations (c) 3,766.1 3,211.8 552.0 0.4 1.9 Pension and other post-retirement benefits (d) 14.5 14.5 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 93.8 1.3 69.1 23.4 Other contractual obligations (f) 1,028.3 358.3 400.0 220.0 50.0 Total contractual obligations $ 11,008.9 $ 4,043.7 $ 4,474.8 $ 1,526.3 $ 964.1 (a) Our available debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants, including negative covenants related to liens and our total capitalization ratio. Any violation of covenants or other events of default, which are not waived or cured, or changes in our credit rating could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financing arrangements. Due to our intent and ability to refinance commercial paper obligations on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facility and the variable interest rates associated with these debt instruments, only interest on our Senior Notes is included in the table. During 2018 , we paid $99.0 million for interest charges, net of interest capitalized. (b) We lease office space, manufacturing facilities and various types of manufacturing and data processing equipment. Leases of real estate generally provide for payment of property taxes, insurance and repairs by us. Substantially all of our leases are classified as operating leases. In addition, in 2014 we entered into construction and operating lease agreements to finance the construction of manufacturing and office facilities located in Houston, TX. In January 2016, construction of the facilities was completed and the operating lease commenced. Upon expiration of the lease term in September 2021, we have the option to renew the lease, purchase the facilities or re-market the facilities on behalf of the lessor, including certain guarantees of residual value under the re-marketing option. (c) In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services. These agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier. As substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers orders, the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income. (d) We expect to contribute approximately $ 2.7 million to our international pension plans during 2019 . Required contributions for future years depend on factors that cannot be determined at this time. Additionally, we expect to pay directly to beneficiaries approximately $9.0 million for international unfunded pension plan and $5.5 million for U.S. Non-Qualified unfunded pension plan during 2019. (e) It is reasonably possible that $1.3 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during 2019 , and this amount is reflected in income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 . Although unrecognized tax benefits are not contractual obligations, they are presented in this table because they represent demands on our liquidity. (f) Other contractual obligations represent a mandatorily redeemable financial liability. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we obtained voting control interests in legal onshore/offshore contract entities which own and account for the design, engineering and construction of the Yamal LNG plant. Prior to the amendments of the contractual terms that provided us with voting interest control, we accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting based on our previously held interests in each of these entities. A mandatorily redeemable financial liability of $174.8 million was recognized as of December 31, 2016 to account for the fair value of the non-controlling interests. During the year ended December 31, 2018 we revalued the liability to reflect current expectations about the obligation. Refer to Note 22 for further information regarding the fair value measurement assumptions of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability and related changes in its fair value. 55 OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following is a summary of other off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2018 : Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period (In millions) Total amount Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Letters of credit and bank guarantees (a) $ 4,796.9 $ 1,932.5 $ 2,024.5 $ 670.4 $ 169.5 Surety bonds (a) 1.1 1.1 Total other off-balance sheet arrangements $ 4,798.0 $ 1,933.6 $ 2,024.5 $ 670.4 $ 169.5 (a) As collateral for our performance on certain sales contracts or as part of our agreements with insurance companies, we are liable under letters of credit, surety bonds and other bank guarantees. Our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off-balance sheet financial instruments. These off-balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed, revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment. Historically, our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent; consequently, management believes it is not reasonably likely there will be material claims against these commitments. However, should these financial instruments become unavailable to us, our operations and liquidity could be negatively impacted. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented and the related disclosures in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements address all important accounting areas where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our significant accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts that can span several years. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers. The unit of account in ASC Topic 606 is a performance obligation. A contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A significant portion of our total revenue recognized over time relates to our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea segments, primarily for the entire range of onshore facilities, fixed and floating offshore oil and gas facilities, and subsea exploration and production equipment projects that involve the design, engineering, manufacturing, construction, and assembly of complex, customer-specific systems. Because of control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables, and requires significant judgment. It is common for our long-term contracts to contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification, the amount can be estimated reliably, and its realization is probable. The estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. 56 We execute contracts with our customers that clearly describe the equipment, systems, and/or services. After analyzing the drawings and specifications of the contract requirements, our project engineers estimate total contract costs based on their experience with similar projects and then adjust these estimates for specific risks associated with each project, such as technical risks associated with a new design. Costs associated with specific risks are estimated by assessing the probability that conditions arising from these specific risks will affect our total cost to complete the project. After work on a project begins, assumptions that form the basis for our calculation of total project cost are examined on a regular basis and our estimates are updated to reflect the most current information and management best judgment. Adjustments to estimates of contract revenue, total contract cost, or extent of progress toward completion are often required as work progresses under the contract and as experience is gained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. The nature of accounting for long-term contracts is such that refinements of the estimating process for changing conditions and new developments are continuous and characteristic of the process. Consequently, the amount of revenue recognized over time is sensitive to changes in our estimates of total contract costs. There are many factors, including, but not limited to, the ability to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers expectations, the availability and costs of labor and material resources, productivity, and weather, all of which can affect the accuracy of our cost estimates, and ultimately, our future profitability. Our operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by approximately $6.7 million , as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2017 . During the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recognized changes in our estimates that had an impact on our margin in the amounts of $(5.1) million , $(5.9) million and $4.3 million in our Onshore/Offshore, Subsea and Surface technologies segments, respectively. The changes in contract estimates are attributed to better than expected performance throughout our execution of our projects. Accounting for Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United Kingdom and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. In determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. To the extent, we believe recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and finally, the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations. Forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future income, we use our internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. We develop our budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends, economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance, our backlog, planned timing of new product launches and customer sales commitments. Significant changes in our judgment related to the expected realizability of a deferred tax asset results in an adjustment to the associated valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018, we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets where we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income in jurisdictions in which we have cumulative net operating losses. 57 The calculation of our income tax expense involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained on examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits. We adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of new information previously unavailable. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expense in the periods in which they are determined. Accounting for Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Plans The determination of the projected benefit obligations of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are important to the recorded amounts of such obligations on our consolidated balance sheet and to the amount of pension expense in our consolidated statements of income. In order to measure the obligations and expense associated with our pension benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We update these estimates on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. These accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty and difficulty in estimating these measures. Different estimates used by management could result in our recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Due to the specialized and statistical nature of these calculations which attempt to anticipate future events, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the costs and obligations associated with these pension benefits. The discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are primarily based on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets, respectively. These measures are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management judgment and can materially affect net income. The actuarial assumptions and estimates made by management in determining our pension benefit obligations may materially differ from actual results as a result of changing market and economic conditions and changes in plan participant assumptions. While we believe the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in plan participant assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets on pension expense and the projected benefit obligation: (In millions, except basis points) Increase (Decrease) in 2018 Pension Expense Before Income Taxes Increase (Decrease) in Projected Benefit Obligation at December 31, 2018 25 basis point decrease in discount rate $ 1.1 $ 48.2 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ (1.0 ) $ (49.0 ) 25 basis point decrease in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets $ 2.6 N/A 25 basis point increase in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets $ (2.6 ) N/A 58 Determination of Fair Value in Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. The determination of fair value requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, and in making these determinations, management uses all available information. If necessary, we have up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. For tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the determination of fair value utilizes several valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows which has assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenue and expenses associated with an asset. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include, but are not limited to, discount rates, future revenues and operating costs, projections of capital costs, and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Business combinations are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Long-lived assets, including vessels, property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future productivity of the asset, operating costs and capital decisions and all available information at the date of review. If future market conditions deteriorate beyond our current expectations and assumptions, impairments of long-lived assets may be identified if we conclude that the carrying amounts are no longer recoverable. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting level unit, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have established October 31 as the date of our annual test for impairment of goodwill. We identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we measure the impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. Reporting units with goodwill are tested for impairment using a quantitative impairment test. When using the quantitative impairment test, determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted future cash flow model. The majority of the estimates and assumptions used in a discounted future cash flow model involve unobservable inputs reflecting management own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of a business. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. 59 A lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines of the reporting unit products and services, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, changes in customer demand, and other changes in market conditions, which may affect certain market participant assumptions used in the discounted future cash flow model based on internal forecasts of revenues and expenses over a specified period plus a terminal value (the income approach). When assessing triggering factors, on a quarterly and also on an annual basis, we also analyze the relationship between our market capitalization and our consolidated book value of equity. The income approach estimates fair value by discounting each reporting unit estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the reporting unit. To arrive at our future cash flows, we use estimates of economic and market assumptions, including growth rates in revenues, costs, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, tax rates and cash expenditures. Future revenues are also adjusted to match changes in our business strategy. We believe this approach is an appropriate valuation method. Under the market multiple approach, we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting unit projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or three year average. Our reporting unit valuations were determined primarily by utilizing the income approach, with a lesser weighting attributed the market multiple approach. Late in the fourth quarter of 2018, oil prices fell dramatically and our market capitalization declined significantly, together with other companies in the oil service industry. This short-term event is not expected to have significant negative impact on our short-term performance and it is not changing materially our medium-term and long-term cash flow projections. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our Surface Technologies and Onshore/Offshore reporting units ranged from approximately 56% to in excess of 200% of the respective carrying amounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $1,383.0 million of goodwill impairment charges in our Subsea reporting unit. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure related to the impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2018 . The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of our reporting units at December 31, 2018: 2018 Year of cash flows before terminal value 5 Discount rates 12.0% to 13.0% EBITDA multiples 7.0 - 8.5x Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to goodwill impairment testing during 2018 . OTHER MATTERS On March 28, 2016, FMC Technologies received an inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") related to the DOJ's investigation of whether certain services Unaoil S.A.M. provided to its clients, including FMC Technologies, violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). On March 29, 2016, Technip S.A. also received an inquiry from the DOJ related to Unaoil. We are cooperating with the DOJ's investigations and, with regard to FMC Technologies, a related investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In late 2016, Technip S.A. was contacted by the DOJ regarding its investigation of offshore platform projects awarded between 2003 and 2007, performed in Brazil by a joint venture company in which Technip S.A. was a minority participant, and we have also raised with DOJ certain other projects performed by Technip S.A. subsidiaries in Brazil between 2002 and 2013. The DOJ has also inquired about projects in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea that were awarded to Technip S.A. subsidiaries in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We are cooperating with the DOJ in its investigation into potential violations of the FCPA in connection with these projects. We have contacted the Brazilian authorities (Federal Prosecution Service (MPF), the Comptroller General of Brazil (CGU) and the Attorney General of Brazil (AGU)) and are cooperating with their investigation concerning the projects in Brazil and have also contacted French authorities (the Parquet National Financier (PNF)) about these existing matters. 60 We have been informed that these authorities in Brazil, the U.S. and France have been coordinating their investigations, which could result in a global resolution. These matters have progressed to a point where a probable estimate of the aggregate settlement amount with all authorities is $280.0 million for which we have taken a provision in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018 . These matters involve negotiations with law enforcement authorities in three separate jurisdictions, and there is no certainty that a global settlement will be reached or that the settlement will not exceed current accruals. These authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under anticorruption laws and regulations, which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. These authorities have entered into agreements with, and obtained a range of sanctions against, numerous public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments whereby civil and/or criminal penalties were imposed. Recent civil and criminal settlements have included fines, deferred prosecution agreements, guilty pleas and other sanctions, including the requirement that the relevant corporation retain a monitor to oversee its compliance with anticorruption laws. Any of these remedial measures, if applicable to us, as well as potential customer reaction to such remedial measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
