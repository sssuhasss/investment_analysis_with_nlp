Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: Critical accounting policies. This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Results of operations. This section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2009 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2008, and comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2008 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2007. Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies General Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial 19 Table of Contents statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Accounting guidance requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of our fair value measurements. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2009 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Based on our impairment assessments in 2009, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction-based fees. Deferred revenues consist primarily of advance billings for services. Revenue is recognized as services are provided. Revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Other We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. We use derivative financial instruments for managing 20 Table of Contents our exposure to changes in interest rates, managing our ratio of fixed to floating-rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Results of Operations Business Segments Our ongoing operations are comprised of the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment, Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment and Corporate and Other segment. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and settlement, electronic funds transfer, and debit processing products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, Internet banking, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations. In July 2008, we completed the sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in the Insurance Services ( Insurance ) segment. Components of Revenues and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Processing and Services Processing and services revenues, which in 2009 represented approximately 80% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily generated from account and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenues are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenues, which in 2009 represented approximately 20% of our consolidated revenues, are primarily derived from integrated print and card production (15%) and software licenses (5%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Prior to our sale of a 51% interest in substantially all of the businesses in our Insurance segment ( Fiserv Insurance ) on July 14, 2008, product revenues and cost of product also included prescription related items which were recognized on a gross basis. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenues and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Total Revenues Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Financial Payments Insurance Corporate and Other Total Total revenues: 2009 $ 1,942 $ 2,160 $ $ (25 ) $ 4,077 2008 1,992 2,131 513 (49 ) 4,587 2007 1,830 1,070 804 (27 ) 3,677 2009 Revenue growth (decline) $ (50 ) $ 29 $ (513 ) $ 24 $ (510 ) 2009 Revenue growth (decline) percentage (3 %) 1 % (100 %) (11 %) 2008 Revenue growth (decline) $ 162 $ 1,061 $ (291 ) $ (22 ) $ 910 2008 Revenue growth (decline) percentage 9 % 99 % (36 %) 25 % Total revenues decreased $510 million, or 11%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and increased $910 million, or 25%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in total revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to 22 Table of Contents our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease of $513 million, or 11%. As a result of this transaction, the revenues of Fiserv Insurance are no longer included in our consolidated revenues beginning July 15, 2008. In addition, 2009 revenues were impacted by a 1% increase in revenues in our Payments segment and a 3% decline in revenues in our Financial segment. Incremental revenue from acquired companies totaled $27 million, or approximately 1%, in 2009. The increase in total revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of increased processing and services revenues from our acquisition of CheckFree Corporation ( CheckFree ) in December 2007, partially offset by decreased revenues in our Insurance segment as a result of the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Revenues in our Financial segment decreased $50 million, or 3%, in 2009 and increased $162 million, or 9%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Financial segment revenues in 2009 were negatively impacted by 2 percentage points, or $35 million, due to lower contract termination fee revenues, which declined from $42 million in 2008 to $7 million in 2009. The businesses in our Financial segment generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees. These fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a contract is terminated. In addition, revenues in our Financial segment were negatively impacted by lower discretionary spending by our financial institution clients and a decline in item processing revenues. The increase in Financial segment revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to incremental processing and services revenues from our acquisition of CheckFree. Revenues in our Payments segment increased $29 million, or 1%, in 2009 and increased $1.06 billion, or 99%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The revenue growth in our Payments segment during 2009 was primarily driven by new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our bill payment and electronic funds transfer businesses, partially offset by revenue declines in our investment services business from a reduction in the number of accounts processed as a result of the volatility in the U.S. equity markets and a decline in product revenues due primarily to lower software license revenues. Revenue increases in our Payments segment during 2008 were primarily due to incremental processing and services revenue from our acquisition of CheckFree. Total Expenses Total expenses decreased $548 million, or 15%, in 2009 and increased $738 million, or 25%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in total expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance in July 2008, which resulted in a decrease in total expenses of $469 million, or 13%. The increase in total expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily the result of our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by decreased expenses due to the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 55.4% in 2009 from 56.3% in 2008 and 59.2% in 2007. The decreases in both 2009 and 2008 compared to the prior years were favorably impacted by overall improvements in operating efficiencies as a result of improved business mix and the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure. The decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to higher-margin processing revenues associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 71.7% in 2009 compared to 81.7% in 2008 and 79.7% in 2007. The lower percentage of revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which generated historical overall operating margins of less than 10 percent primarily due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in both product revenues and cost of product. Prescription product costs totaled $312 million and $449 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared to no such costs in 2009. 23 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $62 million, or 8%, in 2009 and increased $300 million, or 58%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was impacted by a decrease of $36 million, or 4%, from our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. In addition, the decline in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009 was due to a $36 million positive impact resulting from lower merger related expenses and the reversal of a pre-acquisition liability associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by a $20 million increase in employee severance and related expenses. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree, including increases in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in expenses from our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Operating Income and Operating Margin Years Ended December 31, (In millions) Financial Payments Insurance Corporate and Other Total Operating income: 2009 $ 569 $ 617 $ $ (240 ) $ 946 2008 545 579 44 (260 ) 908 2007 506 253 78 (101 ) 736 Operating income growth (decline): 2009 $ 24 $ 38 $ (44 ) $ 20 $ 38 2009 percentage 4 % 7 % (100 %) 4 % 2008 $ 39 $ 326 $ (34 ) $ (159 ) $ 172 2008 percentage 8 % 129 % (44 %) 23 % Operating margin: 2009 29.3 % 28.6 % 23.2 % 2008 27.4 % 27.2 % 8.7 % 19.8 % 2007 27.6 % 23.6 % 9.7 % 20.0 % Operating margin growth (decline): (1) 2009 1.9 % 1.4 % 3.4 % 2008 (0.2 %) 3.6 % (1.0 %) (0.2 %) (1) Represents the percentage point improvement or decline in operating margin. Total operating income increased $38 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating margin increased to 23.2% in 2009 from 19.8% in 2008. Operating margins improved by 340 basis points in 2009 due primarily to strong operating margin expansion in both the Financial and Payments segments, the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered our overall cost structure, lower merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, and the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, which historically generated lower operating margins. These positive factors were partially offset by decreases in higher-margin contract termination fees. Total operating income increased $172 million, or 23%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating margin decreased to 19.8% in 2008 from 20.0% in 2007. The overall increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree in December 2007. Our operating margin in 2008 of 19.8% was negatively impacted by an increase in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, and by declining operating margins in the Insurance segment, partially offset by strong results in our Payments segment. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $24 million, or 4%, in 2009 and $39 million, or 8%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Operating margins were 29.3%, 27.4% and 27.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and increased 190 basis points in 2009 and declined 20 basis points in 2008. The improvements in operating income and operating margin in 2009 were primarily due to overall improvements in operating efficiencies, cost reductions, improved business mix, and scale efficiencies in our bank and credit 24 Table of Contents union account processing businesses. These positive factors were partially offset by the negative impact of a $35 million decrease in higher-margin contract termination fee revenues. The increase in operating income during 2008 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree in December 2007. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $38 million, or 7%, in 2009 and $326 million, or 129%, in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. Operating margins were 28.6%, 27.2% and 23.6% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and increased 140 basis points in 2009 and 360 basis points in 2008. The Payments segment operating income and margin in 2009 and 2008 were positively impacted by cost savings associated with the integration of CheckFree and growth in higher-margin revenues resulting in improved operating leverage and scale efficiencies in our transaction processing electronic payments businesses, partially offset by a decline in software license revenues in 2009. In addition, the increases in operating income and margin in 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by higher-margin revenues associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. The operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment decreased $20 million in 2009 and increased $159 million in 2008 compared to the prior year periods. The operating loss decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a $36 million positive impact resulting from lower merger related expenses and the reversal of a pre-acquisition liability associated with our acquisition of CheckFree, partially offset by a $20 million increase in employee severance and related expenses and increased spending for several company-wide initiatives in 2009. The operating loss increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to our acquisition of CheckFree resulting in increases in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets of $117 million and merger related expenses of $29 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $220 million, $260 million and $76 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $40 million decrease in interest expense in 2009 was primarily due to decreases in total outstanding borrowings and interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008. The $184 million increase in interest expense in 2008 was primarily due to new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2007 to finance our $4.4 billion acquisition of CheckFree. Interest Income Interest income was $8 million, $13 million and $7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest income in 2008 was higher than 2009 and 2007 due primarily to interest income earned from investing the proceeds of several business dispositions. Loss on Sale of Businesses In 2008, we recognized a $21 million pre-tax loss due to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 37.2% in 2009, 44.9% in 2008, and 38.2% in 2007. The higher effective income tax rate in 2008 was due primarily to income taxes associated with our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. In addition, our effective income tax rate in 2009 includes the positive impact of a tax settlement. The significant items impacting our effective income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows: 25 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Statutory federal, state and foreign income tax provisions, net 38.1 % 38.3 % 38.2 % Sale of Fiserv Insurance (1) 6.6 % Tax settlement (2) (0.9 %) Effective income tax rate 37.2 % 44.9 % 38.2 % (1) Represents a $34 million income tax provision related to our sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance. (2) Represents a $7 million income tax benefit recognized in conjunction with the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting income tax reserve. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Beginning in July 2008, we record our 49% share of Fiserv Insurance net income, $12 million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008, as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate. Income from Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations totaled $3 million, $211 million and $27 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Income from discontinued operations includes after-tax gains from the sale of businesses of $25 million and $229 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Income Per Share Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $3.04 in 2009 compared to $2.20 in 2008 and $2.44 in 2007. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 was positively impacted by operating income growth in 2009, a $0.34 per share after-tax loss on the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance recognized in 2008, and a $0.14 per share decrease in merger related expenses in 2009 associated with our acquisition of CheckFree. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2008 compared to 2007 was negatively impacted by a $0.45 per share increase in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, the loss on the sale of a 51% interest in Fiserv Insurance, and a $0.11 per share increase in merger related expenses. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.58, $0.57 and $0.12 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations, our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 of $363 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $870 million at December 31, 2009. Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2009 2008 $ % Income from continuing operations $ 473 $ 358 $ 115 Depreciation and other amortization 188 200 (12 ) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 145 150 (5 ) Share-based compensation 36 34 2 Loss on sale of businesses 21 (21 ) Net changes in working capital and other 8 3 5 Operating cash flow $ 850 $ 766 $ 84 11 % Capital expenditures $ 198 $ 198 $ 26 Table of Contents Our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, or operating cash flow, increased $84 million, or 11%, to $850 million in 2009 from $766 million in 2008. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were $198 million, less than 5% of our total revenues, in 2009 and 2008. In 2009, we received net cash of $132 million related to discontinued operations, including proceeds from the sale of businesses and contingent purchase price related to our 2008 sale of a portion of Fiserv ISS. In the third quarter of 2009, Fiserv Insurance, of which we own 49%, refinanced its outstanding debt. In conjunction with the refinancing, we loaned Fiserv Insurance $67 million, with interest payable quarterly and the principal due in 2013. In December 2009, Fiserv Insurance repaid $10 million of this loan. Share Repurchases We purchased $175 million, $441 million and $469 million of our common stock in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On May 20, 2009, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of our common stock. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. As of December 31, 2009, we had 2.2 million shares remaining under this authorization. On February 24, 2010, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million additional shares of our common stock. Indebtedness December 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 3,641 $ 4,105 In 2009, we used a portion of our operating cash flow to repay $475 million of debt, which reduced our total outstanding debt, including current maturities, to $3.64 billion at December 31, 2009. Our long-term debt currently consists primarily of $1.88 billion under our unsecured senior term loan facility and $1.75 billion under senior notes borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2009. Senior Term Loan In December 2007, we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks. Our term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate and mature in November 2012. Principal payments of $255 million and $375 million are due in December 2010 and 2011, respectively, and the remaining principal of $1.25 billion is due in November 2012. The weighted-average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 0.9% at December 31, 2009. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. Revolving Credit Facility We maintain a $900 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The facility bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a specified margin or the bank base rate. There are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility, as amended, contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments, and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense. The facility expires on March 24, 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we issued letters of credit totaling $30 million under this facility and our available borrowings were $870 million. 27 Table of Contents Senior Notes In November 2007, we issued $1.25 billion of 6.125% senior notes due in November 2012 and $500 million of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017, which pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to these notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit: our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; our ability to create or assume liens; and our ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintain a series of interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) with total notional values of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009. The Swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.8%, prior to financing spreads and related fees, and have expiration dates through September 2012. Shelf Registration Statement In 2007, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, or a combination thereof. Each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, we had a credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and BBB with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody or S&P downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 2.0%. In no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed 2.0% above the original interest rate. The interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated A3 (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody and A- (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. 28 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
