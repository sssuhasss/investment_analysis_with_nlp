Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business-Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in 38 Table of Contents writing from time to time, are based on management beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and/or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; risks associated with the impact on our insurance program if TRIA, which expires on December 31, 2007, is not extended or is extended on different terms; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of 39 Table of Contents all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on Form 8-K or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non-core assets that have limited growth potential or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors. The office markets in which we operate continued to show dramatic improvement over the past twelve months, with the pace of rental rate growth and the demand for high-quality space continuing to accelerate. We continue to experience strong market rental rate growth in midtown Manhattan, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Boston. We expect this trend to continue, but its impact on our rental revenues will be felt gradually given the modest amount of 2007 lease expirations. Some of the leases that expire in 2007 reflect the high rents achieved in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and therefore we could experience some roll down in near-term rents at certain properties in our portfolio despite the positive overall trends in our markets. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets, so combining strong demand, increasing replacement costs and scarcity of supply, we expect our assets to continue to appreciate over time. Many individuals and institutions have recognized these same conditions which have translated into a supply of capital that continues to compete to own commercial real estate assets. We remain concerned that making significant acquisitions at today pricing levels could reduce our ability to enhance our long-term earnings growth rate, so we have chosen the path of selectively selling assets, reducing the overall size of the portfolio and focusing our more substantial investments on new development opportunities. During 2006, we sold $1.26 billion of assets, compared with $838 million during 2005. We believe the sale of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and the sale of 5 Times Square on February 15, 2007 are evidence of a trend that sees allocators of capital continuing to place premiums on high-quality, well-located office buildings resulting in lower capitalization rates and higher prices per square foot. As an owner of these types of assets, we are pleased with higher valuations, and, given current market conditions, we intend to continue to explore the selective sale of some of our assets (including core assets) to realize some of this value. Unfortunately, the same market conditions that are leading to record valuations for Class A office buildings and that make significant asset sales attractive to us are also continuing to make it more difficult for us to acquire assets at what we believe to be attractive rates of return. However, we have acquired and intend to pursue the acquisition of assets at attractive initial rates of return or where the potential exists for long-term value appreciation. As we look forward into 2007 and 2008, we will be operating with a smaller portfolio than in prior years and we will be concentrating on a growing development pipeline. Given current market conditions, we generally believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be significantly greater than those we can expect to realize from acquisitions. As a result, we will continue to focus significant energy and capital on our current and future development pipeline. We are also considering alternative uses (i.e., non-office) for some of our land holdings and may participate in or undertake alternative development projects. During 2006, we started more than $300 million of developments and in 2007 we anticipate starting in excess of $1 billion of developments. 40 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment 41 Table of Contents loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, ( SFAS No. 144 ) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. SFAS No. 144 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at 42 Table of Contents their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; debt to market capitalization; and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenant industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenant credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and/or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenant credit is below our acceptable parameters. We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1-4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases was approximately 7.8 years as of December 31, 2006. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and frequent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. 43 Table of Contents Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99-19. Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99-19. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 131, 121 and 125 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property 44 Table of Contents Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio ) and the changes attributable to the Total Property Portfolio. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), minority interest in Operating Partnership, losses from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 113 properties, including two hotel properties, properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2005 and owned through December 31, 2006, totaling approximately 29.0 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2005 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2006. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold. 45 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,243,672 $ 1,209,589 $ 34,083 2.82 % $ 32,208 $ 104,430 $ 15,498 $ 28 $ 24,117 $ 412 $ 20,402 $ 13,094 $ 1,335,897 $ 1,327,553 $ 8,344 0.63 % Termination Income 8,137 5,416 2,721 50.24 % 6,064 8,137 11,480 (3,343 ) (29.12 )% Total Rental Revenue 1,251,809 1,215,005 36,804 3.03 % 32,208 110,494 15,498 28 24,117 412 20,402 13,094 1,344,034 1,339,033 5,001 0.37 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 411,486 389,954 21,532 5.52 % 14,307 44,818 5,866 18 4,731 122 5,424 3,423 441,814 438,335 3,479 0.79 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 840,323 825,051 15,272 1.85 % 17,901 65,676 9,632 10 19,386 290 14,978 9,671 902,220 900,698 1,522 0.17 % Hotel Net Operating Income (1) 21,452 17,588 3,864 21.97 % 21,452 17,588 3,864 21.97 % Consolidated Net Operating Income (1) 861,775 842,639 19,136 2.27 % 17,901 65,676 9,632 10 19,386 290 14,978 9,671 923,672 918,286 5,386 0.59 % Other Revenue: Development and Management services 19,825 17,310 2,515 14.53 % Interest and Other 36,737 12,015 24,722 205.76 % Total Other Revenue 56,562 29,325 27,237 92.88 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 59,375 55,471 3,904 7.04 % Interest 298,260 308,091 (9,831 ) (3.19 )% Depreciation and amortization 256,102 247,385 8,717 3.52 % 3,502 17,695 6,758 7,365 94 3,032 1,655 276,759 266,829 9,930 3.72 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 32,143 12,896 19,247 149.25 % Total Other Expenses 256,102 247,385 8,717 3.52 % 3,502 17,695 6,758 7,365 94 3,032 1,655 666,537 643,287 23,250 3.61 % Income before minority interests $ 605,673 $ 595,254 $ 10,419 1.75 % $ 14,399 $ 47,981 $ 2,874 $ 10 $ 12,021 $ 196 $ 11,946 $ 8,016 $ 313,697 $ 304,324 $ 9,373 3.08 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ $ $ % $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 24,507 4,829 19,678 407.50 % Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ $ $ 1,908 $ $ $ $ $ $ 1,908 (1,908 ) (100.0 )% Minority interests in property partnerships 2,013 6,017 (4,004 ) (66.54 )% Minority interest in Operating Partnership (72,976 ) (74,103 ) 1,127 1.52 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 606,394 151,884 454,510 299.25 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 47,656 (47,656 ) (100.0 )% Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest (4,223 ) 4,223 100.0 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 873,635 $ 438,292 $ 435,343 99.33 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 45. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are comprised of Hotel Revenue of $76,990 and $69,277 less Hotel Expenses of $55,538 and $51,689, respectively per the Consolidated Income Statement. 46 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of approximately $8.3 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $34.1 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $72.2 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $15.5 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $23.7 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $35.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $16.8 million in straight-line rents, primarily due to the reduction of free rent at Times Square Tower during the prior year. Approximately $14.4 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $1.4 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we placed our West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development into service which is included as part of Seven Cambridge Center below. Rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $23.7 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed In- Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) Seven Cambridge Center First Quarter, 2006 $ 19,940 $ 412 $ 19,528 12290 Sunrise Valley Second Quarter, 2006 4,177 4,177 Total $ 24,117 $ 412 $ 23,705 The acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard on June 30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August 10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center on November 30, 2006, increased revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) Prospect Place December 30, 2005 $ 7,253 $ 28 $ 7,225 303 Almaden Avenue June 30, 2006 3,141 3,141 3200 Zanker Road August 10, 2006 3,839 3,839 Four and Five Cambridge Center November 30, 2006 1,265 1,265 Total $ 15,498 $ 28 $ 15,470 Rental revenue from Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased approximately $7.3 million over the year ended December 31, 2005. Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service in July 2006. The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street during 2005. These properties have 47 Table of Contents not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property through agreements entered into at the time of sale. Rental Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $72.2 million, as detailed below: Property Date Sold Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 $ 32,208 $ 72,183 $ (39,975 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005 8,760 (8,760 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005 8,406 (8,406 ) Embarcadero Center West Tower December 14, 2005 15,081 (15,081 ) Total $ 32,208 $ 104,430 $ (72,222 ) Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $8.1 million. This compared to termination income of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to twenty-three tenants. Real Estate Operating Expenses The $3.5 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $21.5 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $30.5 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $5.8 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $4.6 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $2.0 million. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $5.4 million, which represents an increase of approximately 7.0% over the prior year to date. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $8.6 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, with more than half of this increase specifically attributed to properties located in New York City. The remaining $7.5 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is related to an increase in repairs and maintenance. The acquisitions of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard on June 30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August 10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center on November 30, 2006 increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Real Estate Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) Prospect Place December 30, 2005 $ 3,627 $ 18 $ 3,609 303 Almaden Avenue June 30, 2006 1,223 1,223 3200 Zanker Road August 10, 2006 497 497 Four and Five Cambridge Center November 30, 2006 519 519 Total $ 5,866 $ 18 $ 5,848 48 Table of Contents The increase in operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we placed our West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development into service and it is included as part of Seven Cambridge Center below. Operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $4.6 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed In- Service Real Estate Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) Seven Cambridge Center First Quarter, 2006 $ 4,277 $ 122 $ 4,155 12290 Sunrise Valley Second Quarter, 2006 454 454 Total $ 4,731 $ 122 $ 4,609 Operating expenses from Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased approximately $2.0 million over the year ended December 31, 2005. Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and during July 2006, we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service. A decrease of approximately $30.5 million in the Total Property Portfolio operating expenses was due to the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, as detailed below: Property Date Sold Real Estate Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 $ 14,307 $ 32,418 $ (18,111 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005 3,019 (3,019 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005 2,864 (2,864 ) Embarcadero Center West Tower December 14, 2005 6,517 (6,517 ) Total $ 14,307 $ 44,818 $ (30,511 ) We continue to review and monitor the impact of rising insurance and energy costs, as well as other factors, on our operating budgets for fiscal year 2007. Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties increased approximately $3.9 million, a 22.0% increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005 the operations of the Residence Inn by Marriott has been included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on November 4, 2005. We expect the hotels to contribute in the aggregate between approximately $24 million and $25 million of net operating income in 2007. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 Percentage Change Occupancy 79.3 % 77.4 % 2.5 % Average daily rate $ 217.18 $ 197.82 9.8 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 173.35 $ 153.95 12.6 % 49 Table of Contents Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Management Service income has increased approximately $1.6 million due to management contracts following the sales of 100 East Pratt Street, Riverfront Plaza and Embarcadero Center West Tower in 2005, as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June 6, 2006. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to tenant improvement construction management fees earned, the majority of which was in San Francisco. An increase in development income of approximately $0.4 million was due to the increasing development activity at our 505 9 th Street joint venture project. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. During the second quarter of 2006, we issued $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On June 6, 2006, we completed the sale of 280 Park Avenue for net cash proceeds of approximately $875 million. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2006, including 280 Park Avenue and 265 Franklin Street. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. An overall increase of approximately $4.7 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 and approximately $1.5 million related to tax savings during 2005. These increases were offset by approximately $2.1 million of decreased accounting- and legal-related expenses, and other overall decreases aggregating approximately $0.2 million. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to be between $66 million and $67 million for the year 2007. A significant portion of the expected increase results from the final ramp-up on our long-term equity compensation program described below. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 through 2006, vesting occurs over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted in 2007, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and all subsequent LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 and approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the decreases are due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, and Embarcadero Center West Tower in October 2005, which collectively 50 Table of Contents decreased interest expense by $20.4 million and (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, Montvale Center, 101 Carnegie Center, 191 Spring Street and 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard, which decreased interest expense approximately $8.2 million. These decreases were offset by (1) increases of approximately $8.6 million at Times Square Tower due to increasing interest rates (5.85% on December 31, 2006 and 4.87% on December 31, 2005) and the increased principal balance due to the refinancing of the mortgage loan in June 2005, (2) an increase of approximately $12.3 million related to interest paid on the $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership and (3) a net increase of approximately $1.2 million due to the interest imputed on the unpaid redemption price related to the redemption of the outside members equity interest at Citigroup Center to reflect the fair value of debt as well as the impact of placing Seven Cambridge Center into service prior to the repayment of debt. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. We expect interest expense to decrease in 2007, taking into account approximately (1) $361 million of debt repayments during 2006, (2) debt defeasance of approximately $254.4 million in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, an increase in capitalized interest due to development projects, offset by interest on our unsecured exchangeable senior notes and the refinancing of our 599 Lexington Avenue mortgage loan. At December 31, 2006, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at Times Square Tower and our secured borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005: December 31, 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,889,447 $ 3,952,151 Variable rate 711,490 874,103 Total $ 4,600,937 $ 4,826,254 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 84.54 % 81.89 % Variable rate 15.46 % 18.11 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.27 % 6.70 % Variable rate 5.80 % 4.96 % Total 6.20 % 6.39 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $7.3 million due to the placing in-service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006, approximately $6.8 million related to the acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard on June 30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August 10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center in November 2006, and approximately $1.4 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center 51 Table of Contents West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $14.2 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $7.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. We expect capitalized wages to increase proportionately with our increased development activity and increased wages into 2007 and 2008. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from early extinguishments of debt For the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized deferred finance costs. During 2006, we also repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by our Embarcadero Center Three property located in San Francisco, California totaling approximately $133.4 million, the mortgage loan collateralized by our 191 Spring Street property located in Lexington, Massachusetts totaling approximately $17.9 million, the mortgage loan collateralized by our Montvale Center property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland totaling approximately $6.6 million and the mortgage loan collateralized by our 101 Carnegie Center property located in Princeton, New Jersey totaling approximately $6.6 million. There were no significant prepayment penalties or write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs related to these repayments. In connection with the sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in May 2005, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss from early extinguishment of debt, which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan and the modification on our Unsecured Line of Credit. Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we have a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately 52 Table of Contents $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest For the year ended December 31, 2006 there were no properties included in discontinued operations. Properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of 40-46 Harvard Street, the Residence Inn by Marriott and Old Federal Reserve. Minority interest in property partnership Minority interest in property partnership consists of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holder interest at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership will no longer reflect an allocation to the minority interest holder. Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006. In connection with the special cash distribution declared in July 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount is reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnership income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income. Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Under the purchase and sale agreement, we have also agreed to provide to the buyer fixed monthly revenue support from the closing date until December 31, 2008. The aggregate amount of the revenue support payments will be approximately $22.5 million and has been recorded as a purchase price adjustment and included in Other Liabilities within our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement we also entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we have guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of 53 Table of Contents space during the ten-year period following the expiration of the current leases for this space. As of the closing of the sale, leases for this space were scheduled to expire at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we have guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we signed new qualifying leases for 26,681 net rentable square feet of the 74,340 net rentable square foot master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $17.7 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $3.3 million) of additional gain on sale of real estate. As of December 31, 2006, the master lease obligation totaled approximately $45.8 million. During February 2007, we signed a new qualifying lease for 22,250 net rentable square feet of the remaining 47,659 net rentable square foot master lease obligation, which will result in the recognition of approximately $15.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $2.7 million) of additional gain on sale of real estate during the first quarter of 2007. As of February 23, 2007, the master lease obligation totaled approximately $27.5 million. In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Street which are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. In addition, the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland are included in gains on sales of real estate and other assets for the year ended December 31, 2005. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Old Federal Reserve in April 2005, Residence Inn by Marriott and 40-46 Harvard Street, both which were sold in November 2005. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. At December 31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 109 properties, including two hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2004 and owned by us through December 31, 2005. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2004 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2005. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired, placed in-service or repositioned during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Our net property operating margins for the Total Property Portfolio, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses, exclusive of the two hotel properties, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, were 68.8% and 69.2%, respectively. 54 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,176,006 $ 1,147,496 $ 28,510 2.48 % $ 32,247 $ 63,067 $ 26,503 $ 19,344 $ 79,703 $ 40,873 $ 13,094 $ 14,369 $ 1,327,553 $ 1,285,149 $ 42,404 3.30 % Termination Income 11,311 3,982 7,329 184.05 % 9 169 11,480 3,991 7,489 187.65 % Total Rental Revenue 1,187,317 1,151,478 35,839 3.11 % 32,247 63,076 26,503 19,344 79,872 40,873 13,094 14,369 1,339,033 1,289,140 49,893 3.87 % Operating Expenses 403,964 380,678 23,286 6.12 % 12,399 22,706 5,665 4,198 12,884 4,474 3,423 4,271 438,335 416,327 22,008 5.29 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 783,353 770,800 12,553 1.63 % 19,848 40,370 20,838 15,146 66,988 36,399 9,671 10,098 900,698 872,813 27,885 3.19 % Hotel Net Operating Income (1) 17,588 16,985 603 3.55 % 17,588 16,985 603 3.55 % Consolidated Net Operating Income (1) 800,941 787,785 13,156 1.67 % 19,848 40,370 20,838 15,146 66,988 36,399 9,671 10,098 918,286 889,798 28,488 3.20 % Other Revenue: Development and Management services 17,310 20,440 (3,130 ) (15.31 )% Interest and Other 12,015 10,339 1,676 16.21 % Total Other Revenue 29,325 30,779 (1,454 ) (4.72 )% Other Expenses: General and administrative 55,471 53,636 1,835 3.42 % Interest 308,091 306,170 1,921 0.63 % Depreciation and amortization 234,937 220,171 14,766 6.71 % 5,983 12,791 5,497 3,850 18,757 7,909 1,655 4,928 266,829 249,649 17,180 6.88 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 12,896 6,258 6,638 106.07 % Total Other Expenses 234,937 220,171 14,766 6.71 % 5,983 12,791 5,497 3,850 18,757 7,909 1,655 4,928 643,287 615,713 27,574 4.48 % Income before minority interests $ 566,004 $ 567,614 $ (1,610 ) (0.28 )% $ 13,865 $ 27,579 $ 15,341 $ 11,296 $ 48,231 $ 28,490 $ 8,016 $ 5,170 $ 304,324 $ 304,864 $ (540 ) (0.18 )% Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 2,602 $ 3,054 $ (452 ) (14.80 )% $ $ 304 $ 103 $ (32 ) $ 2,124 $ 54 4,829 3,380 1,449 42.87 % Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ 1,908 $ 3,344 1,908 3,344 (1,436 ) (42.94 )% Minority interests in property partnerships 6,017 4,685 1,332 28.43 % Minority interest in Operating Partnership (74,103 ) (67,743 ) (6,360 ) 9.39 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 151,884 8,149 143,735 1,763.84 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 47,656 27,338 20,318 74.32 % Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest (4,223 ) (4,223 ) (100.0 )% Net Income available to common shareholders $ 438,292 $ 284,017 $ 154,275 54.32 % (2) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 45. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are comprised of Hotel Revenue of $69,277 and $66,427 less Hotel Expenses of $51,689 and $49,442, respectively per the Consolidated Income Statement. 55 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of $42.4 million in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $38.8 million, Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $28.5 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $7.2 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $30.8 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $1.3 million. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, and the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development in the fourth quarter of 2005 as detailed below: Date Placed-in- service Rental Revenue for the year ended Property 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 69,608 $ 36,470 $ 33,138 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 9,683 4,403 5,280 Cambridge Center West Garage 4 th Quarter 2005 412 412 Total $ 79,703 $ 40,873 $ 38,830 Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $28.5 million from 2004. Included in rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $8.9 million due to increases in our occupancy from 92.1% on December 31, 2004 to 93.8% on December 31, 2005 which was offset by a roll-down in market rents. Straight-line rent increased approximately $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants attributed to higher operating expenses. The acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 1330 Connecticut Avenue on April 1, 2004 and the purchase of the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street on March 24, 2004 increased revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $7.2 million, as detailed below: Date Acquired Rental Revenue for the year ended Property 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 $ 14,860 $ 10,870 $ 3,990 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 11,614 8,474 3,140 Prospect Place December 30, 2005 29 29 Total $ 26,503 $ 19,344 $ 7,159 56 Table of Contents The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of Embarcadero Center West Tower, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street during 2005, and Hilltop Office Center during 2004. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property. Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $30.8 million, as detailed below: Date Sold Rental Revenue for the year ended Property 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Embarcadero Center West Tower December 14, 2005 $ 15,081 $ 17,837 $ (2,756 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005 8,760 23,488 (14,728 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005 8,406 21,602 (13,196 ) Hilltop Office Center February 4, 2004 140 (140 ) Total $ 32,247 $ 63,067 $ (30,820 ) In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property totaling approximately 397,000 square feet. The project entails removing a three-story low-rise section of the property comprised of 100,000 square feet from in-service status and developing it into a 10-story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately 610,000 square feet upon completion. This property is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Rental revenue has decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to taking the three-story low-rise section out of service in September 2004. Termination Income Termination income for year ended December 31, 2005 was related to twenty-three tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $11.5 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to nineteen tenants totaling $4.0 million. During 2005 we completed several leasing transactions which involved taking space back from tenants with resulting termination income and releasing the space at higher rents. Operating Expenses The $22.0 million increase in property operating expenses in the Total Property Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that represent our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $23.3 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.4 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $1.4 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $10.3 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $0.8 million. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $10.2 million, an increase of approximately 14% over the prior year utility expense. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $7.9 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, with approximately half of this increase specifically attributed to properties located in New York City. The remaining $5.2 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses are related to an increase to repairs and maintenance. 57 Table of Contents We placed in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004 and the West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development in the fourth quarter of 2005 increasing operating expenses by approximately $8.4 million as detailed below: Date Placed-in- service Operating Expenses for the year ended Property 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 11,168 $ 4,053 $ 7,115 New Dominion Technology Park Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 1,595 421 1,174 West Garage 4 th Quarter 2005 121 121 Total $ 12,884 $ 4,474 $ 8,410 In addition, approximately $1.4 million of the increase in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the acquisitions of Prospect Place at the end of 2005 as well as our acquisitions in 2004 of 1330 Connecticut Avenue and the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street, as detailed below: Date Acquired Operating Expenses for the year ended Property 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 $ 4,220 $ 2,986 $ 1,234 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 1,427 1,212 215 Prospect Place December 30, 2005 18 18 Total $ 5,665 $ 4,198 $ 1,467 A decrease of approximately $10.3 million in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses relates to the sales of Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, and Hilltop Office Center in 2004, as detailed below: Date Sold Operating Expenses for the year ended Property 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Embarcadero Center West Tower December 14, 2005 $ 6,516 $ 6,866 $ (350 ) 100 East Pratt Street May 12, 2005 3,019 8,039 (5,020 ) Riverfront Plaza May 16, 2005 2,864 7,764 (4,900 ) Hilltop Office Center February 4, 2004 37 (37 ) Total $ 12,399 $ 22,706 $ (10,307 ) Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties increased by approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 the Residence Inn by Marriott was included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on November 4, 2005. 58 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. This information excludes the Residence Inn by Marriott due to its sale on November 4, 2005. 2005 2004 Percentage Change Occupancy 77.4 % 80.0 % (3.2 )% Average daily rate $ 197.82 $ 185.42 6.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 153.95 $ 149.04 3.3 % Development and Management Services Our third-party fee income decreased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 due to the completion of third-party development projects at the National Institute of Health in Washington, D.C. and near completion of our project at 90 Church Street in New York City, partially offset by maintaining management contracts in connection with certain of our asset sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, development fees decreased approximately $4.9 million, offset by an increase in management fees and service income of approximately $1.8 million. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In the first quarter of 2004 we recognized a net amount of approximately $7.0 million of other income in connection with the termination by a third-party of an agreement to enter into a ground lease with us. Excluding this termination, interest and other income increased approximately $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher cash balances as well as higher interest rates during 2005 compared to 2004. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Approximately $2.2 million of the increase was attributable to changes in the form of long-term equity-based compensation, as further described below. In addition, there was an overall increase to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2005. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.8 million attributable to a refund of prior year state taxes based on income and net worth as a result of changes to a state tax law. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting occurs in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 and beyond, vesting occurs over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense associated with $6.1 million of equity-based compensation that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed 59 Table of Contents ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vests over a five-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2004 and approximately $11.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. The majority of the increases are due to (1) the cessation of interest capitalization at Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two, which increased interest expense by $14.9 million, and (2) the assumption of debt in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue in the second quarter of 2004, which increased interest expense by $1.3 million. These increases were offset by (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, as well as Embarcadero Center West Tower in October 2005, which decreased interest expense by $9.7 million, and (2) the repayment of mortgage debt at One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive buildings in the beginning of 2004 which decreased interest expense by $1.4 million. In addition, the impact of refinancing our fixed rate debt collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue using borrowings under our unsecured line at a lower interest rate decreased interest expense approximately $3.0 million. At December 31, 2005, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans on our Times Square Tower, Capital Gallery Expansion and Seven Cambridge Center construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004: December 31, 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,952,151 $ 4,588,024 Variable rate 874,103 423,790 Total $ 4,826,254 $ 5,011,814 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 81.89 % 91.54 % Variable rate 18.11 % 8.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.70 % 6.66 % Variable rate 4.96 % 3.36 % Total 6.39 % 6.38 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Depreciation and amortization from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $10.8 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $1.6 million, the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $13.1 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $5.2 million and Properties Repositioned decreased approximately $3.3 million. In connection 60 Table of Contents with the redevelopment project at Capital Gallery, which is classified as Properties Repositioned, we recognized an accelerated depreciation charge of approximately $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2004 representing the net book value of the portion of the three-story, low-rise section of the building being redeveloped. The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through acquisitions increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $1.6 million, as detailed below: Property Acquired Depreciation and Amortization for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 $ 3,470 $ 2,292 1,178 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 2,027 1,558 469 Total $ 5,497 $ 3,850 $ 1,647 The additions to the Total Property Portfolio through placing properties in-service increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $10.8 million, as detailed below: Property Placed in-service Depreciation and Amortization for the year ended 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3 rd Quarter 2004 $ 16,957 $ 7,066 $ 9,891 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3 rd Quarter 2004 1,706 843 863 West Garage 4 th Quarter 2005 94 94 Total $ 18,757 $ 7,909 $ 10,848 Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $5.9 million. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $5.7 million and $10.8 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. During the third quarter of 2004, we placed in-service Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two development projects and ceased capitalizing the related interest in accordance with our capitalization policy. Losses from early extinguishments of debt For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $12.9 million. In connection with the sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss from early extinguishment of debt which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan which is included in Properties placed in-service, as well as the modification of our unsecured line of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $6.3 million related to the repayments of our mortgage loans collateralized by One and Two Reston Overlook and the 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive buildings. 61 Table of Contents Joint Ventures During the first quarter of 2005, we placed in-service 901 New York Avenue, a 539,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington, D.C., in which we have a 25% ownership interest. The addition of this property contributed approximately $2.1 million to joint venture income for the year ended December 31, 2005. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Property Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during 2005 and 2004 which are no longer included in our operations as of December 31, 2005. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Old Federal Reserve Old Federal Reserve 40-46 Harvard Street 40-46 Harvard Street Residence Inn by Marriott Residence Inn by Marriott Sugarland Business Park- Building One 204 Second Avenue 560 Forbes Boulevard Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven 38 Cabot Boulevard The Arboretum 430 Rozzi Place Sugarland Business Park-Building Two Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza, 100 East Pratt Street and Embarcadero Center West Tower which are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. Also included in gains on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 is the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Hilltop Office Center and a land parcel in Burlington, MA. Hilltop Office Center is not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of this property after the sale. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Properties included in our gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio are shown below: Year ended December 31, 2005 Date Disposed Year ended December 31, 2004 Date Disposed Old Federal Reserve April 2005 430 Rozzi Place January 2004 Residence Inn by Marriott November 2005 Sugarland Business Park-Building Two February 2004 40-46 Harvard Street November 2005 Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven April 2004 The Arboretum April 2004 38 Cabot Boulevard May 2004 Sugarland Business Park-Building One August 2004 204 Second Avenue September 2004 560 Forbes Boulevard December 2004 62 Table of Contents Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership increased $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. In connection with the special cash dividend paid to holders of common stock on October 31, 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated in the distribution on an as-converted basis with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount is reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in the minority interest in our Operating Partnership income allocation related to changes in the partnership ownership interests and an underlying change in allocable income. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. At December 31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service requirements; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund current development costs not covered under construction loans; fund new property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. On December 15, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.40 per common share payable on January 30, 2007 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2006. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2006, including 280 Park Avenue and 265 Franklin Street. The Board of Directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. The payment of the regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and the special dividend of $5.40 per share resulted in a total payment of $6.08 per share on January 30, 2007. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities, as well as cash generated from asset sales. Base rental revenue, recovery 63 Table of Contents income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes. Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, possible property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); income from operations; income from joint ventures; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in BPLP; and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by BPLP, our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved. To the extent that we continue to sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 64 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents were $725.8 million and $261.5 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, representing an increase of $464.3 million. The increase was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 527,979 $ 472,249 $ 55,730 Net cash provided by investing activities $ 229,756 $ 356,605 $ (126,849 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (293,443 ) $ (806,702 ) $ 513,259 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.8 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past year, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and raised proceeds from secured and unsecured borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2006 our cash flows from operating activities exceeded our dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid a special cash dividend of approximately $335.7 million, which cash flows had been generated from sales of real estate assets and which proceeds are not included in cash flows from operating activities. As a result, our total dividends exceeded our total cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2007, we expect our total dividends to exceed our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend which was declared in December 2006 and paid to common stockholders and common unitholders of BPLP on January 30, 2007. The cash flows distributed were generated from sales of real estate assets and which proceeds are included as part of cash flows from investment activities. Dividends will generally exceed cash flows from operating activities during periods in which we sell significant real estate assets and distribute gains on sale that would otherwise be taxable. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash provided by investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 consisted of the following: (in thousands) Net proceeds from the sales of real estate $ 1,130,978 Net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 23,566 The cash provided by these investing activities is offset by: Investments in marketable securities (282,764 ) Recurring capital expenditures (14,417 ) Planned non-recurring capital expenditures associated with acquisition properties (2,237 ) Hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements (6,756 ) Acquisitions/additions to real estate (618,614 ) Net cash provided by investing activities $ 229,756 Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled approximately $293.4 million. This consisted primarily of net repayments of our secured and unsecured indebtedness totaling approximately $424.3 million and payments of dividends and distributions to our shareholders and to the unitholders of our Operating Partnership totaling approximately $391.6 million. The decreases were partially offset by the proceeds of $450 million from our April/May 2006 offering of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes 65 Table of Contents due 2036, net proceeds from equity transactions of approximately $63.4 million and net proceeds from a real estate financing transaction totaling approximately $15.2 million. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Debt Financing. Capitalization At December 31, 2006, our total consolidated debt was approximately $4.6 billion. The weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 6.20% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 4.7 years. Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total market capitalization was approximately $20.4 billion at December 31, 2006. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December 29, 2006 closing stock price of $111.88 per common share and the following: (1) 117,503,542 shares of our common stock, (2) 20,817,587 outstanding common units of limited partnership of BPLP (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 2,256,208 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding preferred units of partnership interest in BPLP, (4) an aggregate of 521,119 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $4.6 billion. Our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2006 represented approximately 22.57% of our total market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness. 66 Table of Contents Debt Financing As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $4.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness, representing 22.57% of our total market capitalization as calculated above under the heading Capitalization, consisting of (1) $1.5 billion in publicly traded unsecured debt having a weighted average interest rate of 5.95% and maturities in 2013 and 2015; (2) $450 million of publicly traded exchangeable senior notes having a weighted average interest rate of 3.75%, an initial redemption date at the option of either the holder or us in 2013 and maturity in 2036 and (3) $2.7 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a weighted average interest rate of 6.74% per annum and weighted average term of 3.3 years (which includes the $225.0 million drawn on our Unsecured Line of Credit secured by 599 Lexington Avenue). As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $225.0 million drawn on our Unsecured Line of Credit which was secured by our 599 Lexington Avenue property in New York and which balance is included under our variable rate mortgages in the table below. The table below summarizes our outstanding debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,889,447 $ 3,952,151 Variable rate 711,490 874,103 Total $ 4,600,937 $ 4,826,254 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 84.54 % 81.89 % Variable rate 15.46 % 18.11 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.27 % 6.70 % Variable rate 5.80 % 4.96 % Total 6.20 % 6.39 % The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus .45% per annum. On February 12, 2007, we repaid $700 million of the variable rate indebtedness above consisting of (1) the $225.0 million draw on our Unsecured Line of Credit, which draw was collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue, and (2) the mortgage loan collateralized by Times Square Tower totaling $475.0 million. The variable rate indebtedness was repaid with proceeds from a new mortgage financing secured by 599 Lexington Avenue totaling $750.0 million, which bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017 (See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). On December 19, 2006, we had terminated our forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38% per annum. Unsecured Line of Credit On August 3, 2006, we modified our $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Unsecured Line of Credit ) by extending the maturity date from October 30, 2007 to August 3, 2010, with a provision for a one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.65% to Eurodollar plus 0.55% per annum. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 15 basis points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in our Operating Partnership unsecured debt ratings. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of 67 Table of Contents Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Company at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. The Unsecured Line of Credit is available to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to fund development of properties, land and property acquisitions and to repay or reduce indebtedness. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Our ability to borrow under our Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%; a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40; an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a minimum net worth requirement; an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and limitations on permitted investments. We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above. We had an outstanding balance on our Unsecured Line of Credit of $225.0 million at December 31, 2006, which was collateralized by our 599 Lexington Avenue property and therefore is included in Mortgage Notes Payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also had $18.1 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Unsecured Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had the ability to borrow an additional $361.9 million under our Unsecured Line of Credit. On February 12, 2007, we repaid the $225.0 million which was collateralized by our 599 Lexington Avenue property. As of February 23, 2007, we have no borrowings outstanding under our Unsecured Line of Credit. Unsecured Senior Notes The following summarizes the unsecured senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Coupon/ Stated Rate Effective Rate (1) Principal Amount Maturity Date (2) 10 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 6.250 % 6.296 % $ 750,000 January 15, 2013 10 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 6.250 % 6.280 % 175,000 January 15, 2013 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 5.625 % 5.636 % 300,000 April 15, 2015 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 5.000 % 5.075 % 250,000 June 1, 2015 Total principal 1,475,000 Net discount (3,525 ) Total $ 1,471,475 (1) Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes. (2) No principal amounts are due prior to maturity. Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of their principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a 68 Table of Contents comparable maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis point in the case of the $250 million 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes that mature on June 1, 2015), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our senior unsecured notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2006 we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. BPLP investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured notes are as follows: Rating Organization Rating Moody Baa2 (stable) Standard & Poor BBB (stable) FitchRatings BBB (stable) The security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, as it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Unsecured exchangeable senior notes On April 6, 2006, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On May 2, 2006, our Operating Partnership issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of the exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option. The notes will be exchangeable into our common stock under certain circumstances. When issued, the initial exchange rate, subject to adjustment, was 8.9461 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $111.78 per share of common stock). Noteholders may require the Operating Partnership to purchase the notes at par initially on May 18, 2013 and, after that date, the notes will be redeemable at par at the option of the Operating Partnership. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006, the exchange rate was adjusted effective December 29, 2006 to 9.3900 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an exchange price of approximately $106.50 per share of common stock). See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the terms of the notes. On February 6, 2007, our Operating Partnership completed an offering of $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount (including $112.5 million as a result of the exercise by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option) of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037. The notes were priced at 97.433333% of their face amount, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 3.438% per annum and net proceeds to us of approximately $840.0 million. The notes were offered and sold to the initial purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The initial purchasers then sold the notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes will be exchangeable into our common stock under certain circumstances at an initial exchange rate, subject to adjustment, of 6.6090 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or an initial exchange price of approximately $151.31 per share of common stock). Noteholders may require the Operating Partnership to purchase the notes at par initially on February 15, 2012 and, commencing on February 20, 2012 and any time thereafter, the notes will be redeemable at par at the option of the Operating Partnership. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the terms of the notes. 69 Table of Contents Mortgage Debt The following represents the outstanding principal balances due under the mortgages notes payable at December 31, 2006: Properties Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date (in thousands) Citigroup Center 7.19 % $ 493,526 (1) May 11, 2011 Times Square Tower 5.85 % 475,000 (2) July 9, 2008 Embarcadero Center One and Two 6.70 % 284,789 December 10, 2008 Prudential Center 6.72 % 265,325 July 1, 2008 599 Lexington Avenue 5.65 % 225,000 (3) August 3, 2010 Embarcadero Center Four 6.79 % 134,058 February 1, 2008 Democracy Center 7.05 % 96,150 April 1, 2009 One Freedom Square 5.33 % 78,007 (4) June 30, 2012 New Dominion Tech Park, Bldg.

The stated principal balance at December 31, 2006 was $490.9 million and the stated interest rate was 7.19% per annum. The interest rate used to adjust the portion of debt associated with the redemption to fair value was 6.25% per annum. (2) The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.50% per annum. This loan was repaid on February 12, 2007. (3) On July 19, 2005, we repaid the mortgage loan through a secured draw on our unsecured line of credit. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rate on this draw under our unsecured line of credit was 5.65% using a weighted average LIBOR plus 0.30% per annum. On December 19, 2006, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a lender for a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum on a ten-year mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million to be collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue. We closed on the mortgage financing on February 12, 2007. (4) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2006 was $72.1 million and the stated interest rate was 7.75%.

(11) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2006 are as follows (in thousands): Year Principal Payments 2007 $ 41492 2008 1,268,672 2009 191,982 2010 351,844 2011 540,384 Thereafter 264,992 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 85% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates. During 2005, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spread in contemplation of obtaining long-term fixed-rate financing to refinance existing debt that is expiring or freely prepayable prior to February 2007. Based on swap spreads at each trade date, the swaps fix the 10-year treasury rate for a financing in February 2007 at a weighted average of 4.34% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $500.0 million. The swaps were to go into effect in February 2007 and expire in February 2017. We entered into the interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedges to reduce our exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the Treasury rate in contemplation of obtaining ten-year fixed-rate financing in early 2007. On December 19, 2006, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a lender for a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum on a ten-year mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million to be collateralized by our 599 Lexington Avenue property in New York City. 71 Table of Contents On February 12, 2007, we closed on the mortgage financing. In conjunction with the interest rate lock agreement, we terminated our forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38% per annum. We recorded the changes in fair value of the swap contracts related to the effective portion of the interest rate contracts totaling approximately $10.9 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within the our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect that within the next twelve months we will reclassify into earnings approximately $1.0 million of the amounts recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relating to the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts. At December 31, 2005, derivatives with a fair value of $6.2 million were included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and derivatives with a fair value of $0.2 million were included in Other Liabilities within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded the changes in fair value of the swap contracts related to the effective portion of the interest rate contracts totaling approximately $6.0 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness in 2005 was not material. As of December 31, 2006, no derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives not designated as hedges, which consist entirely of two immaterial interest rate caps, are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks. At December 31, 2006, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $711 million. At December 31, 2006, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 5.80%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $874.1 million. At December 31, 2005, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 4.96%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 84.40%, 83.74%, 82.97%, 82.06% and 81.98% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, after allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership. 72 Table of Contents In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2003 and 2002 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate. The adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions. The adjustments for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments from the first quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment. The adjustments for early lease surrender for the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted from a unique lease transaction related to the surrender of space by a tenant that was accounted for as a termination for GAAP purposes and recorded in income at the time the space was surrendered. However, we continued to collect payments monthly after the surrender of space through the month of July 2002, the date on which the terminated lease would otherwise have expired under its original terms. Management presents FFO after the early surrender lease adjustment because economically this transaction impacted periods subsequent to the time the space was surrendered by the tenant and, therefore, recording the entire amount of the lease termination payment in a single period made FFO less useful as an indicator of operating performance. Although these adjustments are attributable to a single lease, the transaction impacted multiple reporting periods and resulted in an adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2002. Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Neither FFO, nor FFO as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 73 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net income available to common shareholders $ 873,635 $ 438,292 $ 284,017 $ 365,322 $ 440,971 Add: Preferred dividend 3,412 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest 4,223 Minority interest in Operating Partnership 72,976 74,103 67,743 72,729 71,587 Less: Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 47,656 27,338 73,234 25,345 Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 1,908 3,344 10,925 26,195 Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest 606,394 151,884 8,149 57,574 190,443 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 24,507 4,829 3,380 6,016 7,954 Minority interests in property partnerships 2,013 6,017 4,685 1,827 2,408 Income before minority interests in property partnerships, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership, gains on sales of real estate and other assets, discontinued operations, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and preferred dividend 313,697 304,324 304,864 288,475 263,625 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization (1) 283,350 274,476 257,319 216,235 192,574 Income from discontinued operations 2,279 4,238 13,644 32,294 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 6,590 (2) 4,829 3,380 6,016 7,954 Less: Minority interests in property partnerships share of Funds from Operations 479 113 922 3,458 3,223 Preferred dividends and distributions 9,418 (3) 12,918 (3) 15,050 21,249 28,711 Funds from Operations 593,740 572,877 553,829 499,663 464,513 Add(subtract): Losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 31,444 11,041 1,474 2,386 Net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) 1,038 11,874 Early surrender lease adjustment 8,520 Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and early surrender lease adjustment 625,184 583,918 553,829 502,175 487,293 Less: Minority interest in Operating Partnership share of Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and early surrender lease adjustment 97,519 94,946 94,332 90,102 87,804 Funds from Operations available to common shareholders after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) and early surrender lease adjustment $ 527,665 $ 488,972 $ 459,497 $ 412,073 $ 399,489 Our percentage share of Funds from Operations basic 84.40 % 83.74 % 82.97 % 82.06 % 81.98 % Weighted average shares outstanding basic 114,721 111,274 106,458 96,900 93,145 (1) Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $276,759, $266,829, $249,649, $206,686 and $176,412, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $9,087, $8,554, $6,814, $8,475 and $8,955, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $0, $812, $3,292, $3,791 and $10,016, less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,584, $1,719, $2,436, $2,717 and $2,809 and adjustment of asset retirement obligations of $912, $0, $0, $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(2) Our share of diluted Funds from Operations was 85.06%, 84.60%, 84.01%, 83.45% and 83.79% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 75 Table of Contents Net Operating Income Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses on investments in securities, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), preferred dividends, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2002 through 2006.

(2) Committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of December 31, 2006 (tenant improvements and lease commissions). We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Ventures We have investments in eight unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 51%, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2006, the debt related to these ventures was equal to approximately $630.3 million. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2006: Properties Company % Ownership Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date (in thousands) 901 New York Avenue 25.00 % 5.19 % $ 170,000 January 1,2015 Metropolitan Square 51.00 % 8.23 % 130,643 May 1, 2010 Market Square North 50.00 % 7.70 % 90,112 December 19, 2010 Worldgate Plaza 25.00 % 6.24 % 57,000 (1) December 1, 2007 Wisconsin Place 23.89 % 6.88 % 50,770 (2) March 11, 2009 Circle Star 25.00 % 6.57 % 42,000 (3) September 1, 2013 505 9 th Avenue 50.00 % 6.05 % 43,505 (4) See note 4 New York Land Venture 50.00 % 7.60 % 23,600 (5) May 8, 2008 Wisconsin Place 23.89 % 4.38 % 15,124 (6) January 1, 2008 300 Billerica Road 25.00 % 5.69 % 7,500 (3) January 1, 2016 Total $ 630,254 77 Table of Contents (1) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.89% per annum and requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. This mortgage matures in December 2007, with two one-year extension options. In addition, the Value-Added Fund entered into an agreement to cap the interest rate at 9.5% for a nominal fee. (2) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $96.5 million loan commitment (of which our share is $23.1 million) at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum with a maturity in March 2009. The mortgage debt requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (3) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. The mortgage financing bears interest at a fixed rate and requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (4) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $60.0 million loan commitment (of which our share is $30.0 million) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.73% per annum and a $35.0 million loan commitment (of which our share is $17.5 million) which bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. The financing converts to a ten-year fixed rate loan in October 2007 at an interest rate of 5.73% per annum with a provision for an increase in the borrowing capacity by $35.0 million (of which our share would be $17.5 million). The conversion is subject to conditions which we expect to satisfy. As of December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the variable rate portion of the debt was 6.60% per annum. The weighted-average rate as of December 31, 2006 is reflected in the table. (5) We have agreed to guarantee approximately $11.8 million of this loan. The financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. (6) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted to reflect the fair value of the note using an effective interest rate of 4.38% per annum. This note is non-interest bearing with a stated principal balance of $15.5 million (of which our share is approximately $2.9 million) and matures in January 2008. The weighted average rates exclude the impact of this loan. We have agreed, together with our third-party joint venture partners, to guarantee this seller financing on behalf of the land and infrastructure entity. Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at two of our properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In both cases we engaged a specially licensed 78 Table of Contents environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property Status Opinions. The environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. We own a property in Massachusetts where historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The environmental consultant has concluded that (1) certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off-site source property and (2) certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic release on the subject property. We have filed a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to contamination migrating from off-site and a Response Action Outcome ( RAO ) with respect to the identified historic release. The RAO indicates that regulatory closure has been achieved and that no further action is required at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. We own a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. We anticipate that additional response actions necessary to achieve regulatory closure (if any) will be performed prior to or in connection with future development activities. When appropriate, closure documentation will be submitted for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory authority public information process. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. Newly Issued Accounting Standards In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 ( SFAS No. 155 ). The purpose of SFAS No. 155 is to simplify the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value re-measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. 79 Table of Contents In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 ( SFAS No. 156 ). SFAS No. 156 requires recognition of a servicing asset or a servicing liability each time an entity undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract. SFAS No. 156 also requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. SFAS No. 156 is effective as of the beginning of an entity first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 156 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN No. 48 ). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on description, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of FIN No. 48 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 ( SAB No. 108 ), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior period misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 requires the quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. This model is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll-over methods. The roll-over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet. The iron-curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement. SAB 108 was effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations. 80 Table of Contents
