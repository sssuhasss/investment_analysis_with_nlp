The global economy continued to recover in 2010, but growth was very uneven across countries and regions. Emerging nations, led by China, India and Brazil, expanded rapidly, while the U.S., U.K., Europe and Japan continued to grow modestly. United States In the U.S., the economy began to recover early in 2010, fueled by moderate growth in consumption and inventory rebuilding, but slowed in late spring, coincident with the intensification of Europe financial crisis. A slowdown in consumption and domestic demand growth contributed to weak employment gains and an unemployment rate that drifted close to 10 percent. Year-over-year inflation measures receded below one percent and stock market indices declined. Concerns about high unemployment and fears that the U.S. might incur deflation led the Federal Reserve to adopt a second round of quantitative easing that involved purchases of $600 billion of U.S. Treasury securities scheduled to occur through June 2011. The announcement of this policy led to lower interest rates. Bond yields rebounded in the second half of 2010 as the U.S. economy reaccelerated, driven by stronger consumer spending, rapid growth of exports and business investment in equipment and software. The strong holiday retail season provided healthy economic momentum toward year end. Despite only moderate economic growth in 2010, corporate profits rose sharply, benefiting from strong productivity gains and constraints on hiring and operating costs. Cautious business financial practices resulted in a record-breaking $1.5 trillion in free cash flows at non-financial businesses. The housing market remained weak throughout 2010. Home sales were soft, despite lower home prices and low interest rates. There were delays in the foreclosure process on the large number of distressed mortgages and the supply of unsold homes remained high. Based on available Home Price Index (HPI) information, the mild improvement in home prices that occurred in the second half of 2009 continued into early 2010. However, housing prices renewed a downward trend in the second half of 2010, due in part to the expiration of tax incentives for home buyers. Credit quality of bank loans to businesses and households improved significantly in 2010 and the continued economic recovery improved the environment for bank lending. Bank commercial and industrial loans to businesses increased in the last few months of 2010, following their steep recession-related declines, reflecting increasing loan demand relating to stronger production, inventory building and capital spending. Rising disposable personal income, household deleveraging and improving household finances contributed to improving consumer credit quality. Europe In Europe, a financial crisis emerged in mid-2010, triggered by high budget deficits and rising direct and contingent sovereign debt in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain that created concerns about the ability of these European Union (EU) peripheral nations to continue to service their debt obligations. These conditions impacted financial markets and resulted in high and volatile bond yields on the sovereign debt of many EU nations. The financial crisis and efforts by the European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to negotiate a financial support package to financially challenged EU nations unsettled global financial markets and contributed to Euro exchange rate and interest rate volatility. Economic performance of certain EU core nations, led by Germany, remained healthy throughout 2010, while the economies of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain experienced recessionary conditions and slowing growth in response to the financial crisis and the implementation of fiscal austerity programs. Additionally, Spain and Ireland economies declined as a result of material deterioration in their housing sectors. Uncertainty over the outcome of the EU governments financial support programs and worries about sovereign finances continued through year end. For information on our exposure in Europe, see Non-U.S. Portfolio beginning on page 94 and Note 28 Performance by Geographical Area to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Asia Asia, excluding Japan, continued to outperform all other regions in 2010 with strong growth across most countries. China and India continued to lead the region in terms of growth and China became the second largest economy in the world after the U.S., eclipsing Japan. Growth across the region became broader based with consumer demand, investment activity and exports all performing well. Asia remained well positioned to withstand global shocks because of record international reserves, current account surpluses and reduced external leverage. Many Asian nations, including China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia, are net external creditors, with China and Japan among the largest holders of U.S. Treasury bonds. Bank balance sheets have improved across most of the region and asset quality issues have remained manageable. Among the key challenges faced by the region were large capital inflows that placed appreciation pressures on most currencies against the U.S. Dollar (USD), complicating monetary policy and adding to excess liquidity pressures. Most countries in the region, including China, India, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, began to withdraw fiscal stimulus and tighten monetary policy with hikes in interest rates as growth gathered momentum and as food and broader price inflation pressures began to increase. Japan performed well early in the year, but the economy weakened at the end of the year due to weakening consumer demand, and appreciation of the yen that hurt export competitiveness. For information on our exposure in Asia, see Non-U.S. Portfolio beginning on page 94 and Note 28 Performance by Geographical Area to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Emerging Nations In the emerging nations, inflation pressures began to mount and their central banks raised interest rates or took steps to tighten monetary policy and slow bank lending. Strong growth in emerging nations and their favorable economic outlooks attracted capital from the industrialized nations. The excess global liquidity generated by the accommodative monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and other central banks also flowed into emerging nations. These capital inflows put upward pressure on many emerging nation currencies. As a result, some emerging nations, such as Brazil, experienced strong currency appreciation. However, in other nations, that peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, currency appreciation was muted causing inflationary pressures and rapid real estate price appreciation. Global economic momentum, along with the generally weak U.S. dollar and easing monetary policies in several industrialized nations, contributed to rising prices for industrial commodities in these emerging nations. Through year end, inflation pressures in key emerging nations continued to mount. For more information on our emerging nations exposure, see Table 48 on page 95. Performance Overview In 2010, we reported a net loss of $2.2 billion compared to net income of $6.3 billion in 2009. After preferred stock dividends and accretion of $1.4 billion in 2010 compared with $8.5 billion in 2009, net loss applicable to common shareholders was $3.6 billion, or $0.37 per diluted common share, compared to $2.2 billion, or $0.29 per diluted common share in 2009. Our 2010 results reflected, among other things, $12.4 billion in goodwill impairment charges, including non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges of Bank of America 2010 25 Table of Contents $10.4 billion in Global Card Services and $2.0 billion in Home Loans & Insurance . For more information about the goodwill impairment charges in 2010, see Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on page 107 and Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges, net income was $10.2 billion for 2010. After preferred stock dividends and accretion, net income applicable to common shareholders, excluding the goodwill impairment charges was $8.8 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share, for 2010. Revenue, net of interest expense on a FTE basis decreased $9.6 billion or eight percent to $111.4 billion in 2010. Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion to $52.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new consolidation guidance. The increase was partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower rates on the core assets and trading assets and liabilities. Noninterest income decreased $13.8 billion to $58.7 billion in 2010 compared to $72.5 billion in 2009. Contributing to the decline was lower mortgage banking income, down $6.1 billion, largely due to $6.8 billion in representations and warranties provision, and decreases in equity investment income of $4.8 billion, gains on sales of debt securities of $2.2 billion, trading account profits of $2.2 billion, service charges of $1.6 billion and insurance income of $694 million, compared to 2009. These declines were partially offset by an increase in other income of $2.4 billion and a decrease in impairment losses of $1.9 billion. Representations and warranties expense increased $4.9 billion to $6.8 billion in 2010 compared to $1.9 billion in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by a $4.1 billion provision for representations and warranties in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter provision includes $3.0 billion related to the impact of the agreements reached with the GSEs on December 31, 2010, pursuant to which we paid $2.8 billion to resolve repurchase claims involving certain residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs by entities related to legacy Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) as well as adjustments made to the representations and warranties liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by these agreements. For more information about the GSE agreements, see Recent Events beginning on page 33 and Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to $28.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for credit losses was $5.9 billion lower than net charge-offs in 2010, resulting in a reduction in reserves, compared with the 2009 provision for credit losses that was $14.9 billion higher than net charge-offs, reflecting reserve additions throughout the year. The reserve reduction in 2010 was due to improving portfolio trends across most of the consumer and commercial businesses, particularly the U.S. credit card, consumer lending and small business products, as well as core commercial loan portfolios. Noninterest expense increased $16.4 billion to $83.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was driven by the $12.4 billion of goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2010. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges, noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, driven by a $3.6 billion increase in personnel costs reflecting the build-out of several businesses and a $1.6 billion increase in litigation expense, partially offset by lower merger and restructuring charges. FTE basis, net income excluding the goodwill impairment charges, noninterest expense excluding goodwill impairment charges and net income applicable to common shareholders excluding the goodwill impairment charges are non-GAAP measures. For corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see Table XIII. Segment Results Effective January 1, 2010, management realigned the former Global Banking and Global Markets business segments into Global Commercial Banking and GBAM . Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These changes did not have an impact on the previously reported consolidated results of the Corporation. For additional information related to the business segments, see Note 26 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 2 Business Segment Results Total Revenue (1) Net Income (Loss) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Deposits $ 13,181 $ 13,890 $ 1,352 $ 2,576 Global Card Services (2) 25,621 29,046 (6,603 ) (5,261 ) Home Loans & Insurance 10,647 16,903 (8,921 ) (3,851 ) Global Commercial Banking 10,903 11,141 3,181 (290 ) Global Banking & Markets 28,498 32,623 6,319 10,058 Global Wealth & Investment Management 16,671 16,137 1,347 1,716 All Other (2) 5,869 1,204 1,087 1,328 Total FTE basis 111,390 120,944 (2,238 ) 6,276 FTE adjustment (1,170 ) (1,301 ) Total Consolidated $ 110,220 $ 119,643 $ (2,238 ) $ 6,276 (1) Total revenue is net of interest expense and is on a FTE basis which is a non-GAAP measure. For more information on this measure, see Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 36, and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Table XIII. (2) In 2010, Global Card Services and All Other are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Accordingly, current year Global Card Services results are comparable to prior year results which are presented on a managed basis. For more information on the reconciliation of Global Card Services and All Other , see Note 26 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deposits net income decreased from the prior year due to a decline in revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased as a result of a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline, partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management (ALM) activities. The noninterest income decline was driven by the impact of Regulation E, which was effective in the third quarter of 2010 and our overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Noninterest expense increased as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service costs was aligned to Deposits from the other segments, and increased litigation expenses. The increase was partially offset by the absence of a special Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assessment in 2009. Global Card Services net loss increased compared to the prior year due primarily to a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Revenue decreased compared to the prior year driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording a reserve related to future payment protection 26 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents insurance claims in the U.K. that have not yet been asserted. Provision for credit losses improved due to lower delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic environment, which resulted in reserve reductions in 2010 compared to reserve increases in the prior year. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge. Home Loans & Insurance net loss increased in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in representations and warranties provision and a $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a decline in provision for credit losses driven by improving portfolio trends. Mortgage banking income declined driven by increased representations and warranties provision and lower production volume reflecting a drop in the overall size of the mortgage market. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and an increase in default-related servicing expense, partially offset by lower production expense and insurance losses. Global Commercial Banking net income increased due to lower credit costs. Revenue was negatively impacted by additional costs related to our agreement to purchase certain retail automotive loans. Net interest income increased due to a growth in average deposits, partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Credit pricing discipline offset the impact of the decline in average loan balances. The provision for credit losses decreased driven by improvements from stabilizing values in the commercial real estate portfolio. GBAM net income decreased driven by the absence of the gain in the prior year related to the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture. Additionally, the decrease was driven by lower sales and trading revenue due to more favorable market conditions in the prior year, partially offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities and gains on legacy assets compared to losses in the prior year. Provision for credit losses declined driven by lower net charge-offs and reserve levels, as well as a reduction in reservable criticized balances. Noninterest expense increased driven by higher compensation costs as a result of the recognition of expense on a proportionately larger amount of prior year incentive deferrals and investments in infrastructure and personnel associated with further development of the business. Income tax expense was adversely affected by a charge related to the U.K. tax rate reduction impacting the carrying value of deferred tax assets. GWIM net income decreased driven by higher noninterest expense and the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia Management long-term asset management business partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs. Revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees and transactional revenue. Provision for credit losses decreased driven by stabilization of the portfolios and the recognition of a single large commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest expense increased due primarily to higher revenue-related expenses, support costs and personnel costs associated with further investment in the business. All Other net income decreased compared to the prior year driven primarily by decreases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses. Revenue decreased due primarily to lower equity investment gains as the prior year included a gain resulting from the sale of a portion of our investment in China Construction Bank (CCB) combined with reduced gains on the sale of debt securities. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was due to improving portfolio trends in the residential mortgage portfolio. Bank of America 2010 27 Table of Contents Financial Highlights Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion to $52.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new consolidation guidance which contributed $10.5 billion to net interest income in 2010. The increase was partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels, the sale of First Republic in 2010 and lower rates on the core assets and trading assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposure. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 basis points (bps) to 2.78 percent for 2010 compared to 2009 due to these same factors. Noninterest Income Table 3 Noninterest Income (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Card income $ 8,108 $ 8,353 Service charges 9,390 11,038 Investment and brokerage services 11,622 11,919 Investment banking income 5,520 5,551 Equity investment income 5,260 10,014 Trading account profits 10,054 12,235 Mortgage banking income 2,734 8,791 Insurance income 2,066 2,760 Gains on sales of debt securities 2,526 4,723 Other income (loss) 2,384 (14 ) Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale debt securities (967 ) (2,836 ) Total noninterest income $ 58,697 $ 72,534 Noninterest income decreased $13.8 billion to $58.7 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The following items highlight the significant changes. Card income decreased $245 million due to the implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income. Service charges decreased $1.6 billion largely due to the impact of Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010 and the impact of our overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Equity investment income decreased by $4.8 billion, as net gains on the sales of certain strategic investments during 2010, including Ita Unibanco, MasterCard, Santander and a portion of our investment in BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) were less than gains in 2009 that included a $7.3 billion gain related to the sale of a portion of our investment in CCB and the $1.1 billion gain related to our BlackRock investment. Trading account profits decreased $2.2 billion due to more favorable market conditions in the prior year and investor concerns regarding sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty. Net credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities of $262 million for 2010 compared to losses of $662 million for 2009. Mortgage banking income decreased $6.1 billion due to an increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties provision and lower volume and margins. Insurance income decreased $694 million due to a liability recorded for future claims related to payment protection insurance (PPI) sold in the U.K. Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $2.2 billion driven by a lower volume of sales of debt securities. The decrease also included the impact of losses in 2010 related to portfolio restructuring activities. Other income (loss) improved by $2.4 billion. The prior year included a net negative fair value adjustment of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010, and the prior year also included a $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture. Legacy asset write-downs included in other income (loss) were $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to net gains of $256 million in 2010. Impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities decreased $1.9 billion reflecting lower impairment write-downs on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to $28.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for credit losses was $5.9 billion lower than net charge-offs for 2010, resulting in a reduction in reserves primarily due to improving portfolio trends throughout the year across the consumer and commercial businesses. The provision for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio decreased $11.4 billion to $25.4 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio including the provision for unfunded lending commitments decreased $8.7 billion to $3.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. Net charge-offs totaled $34.3 billion, or 3.60 percent of average loans and leases for 2010 compared with $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent for 2009. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 96. Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Personnel $ 35,149 $ 31,528 Occupancy 4,716 4,906 Equipment 2,452 2,455 Marketing 1,963 1,933 Professional fees 2,695 2,281 Amortization of intangibles 1,731 1,978 Data processing 2,544 2,500 Telecommunications 1,416 1,420 Other general operating 16,222 14,991 Goodwill impairment 12,400 Merger and restructuring charges 1,820 2,721 Total noninterest expense $ 83,108 $ 66,713 Excluding the goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion, noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was driven by a $3.6 billion increase in personnel costs reflecting the build out of several businesses, the recognition of expense on proportionally larger prior year incentive deferrals and the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments, as well as a $1.6 billion increase in litigation costs. These increases were partially offset by a $901 million decline in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges compared to the prior year. The prior year included a special FDIC assessment of $724 million. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $915 million for 2010 compared to a benefit of $1.9 billion for 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 was not meaningful due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion. The effective tax rate for 2010 excluding goodwill impairment charges from pre-tax income was 8.3 percent compared to (44.0) percent for 2009, primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income excluding the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. Also impacting the 2010 effective tax rate was a 28 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents $392 million charge from a U.K. law change referred to below and a $1.7 billion tax benefit from the release of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits compared to $650 million in 2009. For more information, see Note 21 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2010, the U.K. government enacted a tax law change reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1, 2011. This reduction favorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but also required us to re-measure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rate. The U.K. corporate tax rate reduction resulted in an income tax charge of $392 million in 2010. If future rate reductions were to be enacted as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance, a similar charge to income tax expense for each one percent reduction in the rate would result during each period of enactment. For more information, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56. Balance Sheet Overview Table 5 Selected Balance Sheet Data December 31 Average Balance (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Assets Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell $ 209,616 $ 189,933 $ 256,943 $ 235,764 Trading account assets 194,671 182,206 213,745 217,048 Debt securities 338,054 311,441 323,946 271,048 Loans and leases 940,440 900,128 958,331 948,805 Allowance for loan and lease losses (41,885 ) (37,200 ) (45,619 ) (33,315 ) All other assets 624,013 683,724 732,256 803,718 Total assets $ 2,264,909 $ 2,230,232 $ 2,439,602 $ 2,443,068 Liabilities Deposits $ 1,010,430 $ 991,611 $ 988,586 $ 980,966 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 245,359 255,185 353,653 369,863 Trading account liabilities 71,985 65,432 91,669 72,207 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings 59,962 69,524 76,676 118,781 Long-term debt 448,431 438,521 490,497 446,634 All other liabilities 200,494 178,515 205,290 209,972 Total liabilities 2,036,661 1,998,788 2,206,371 2,198,423 Shareholders equity 228,248 231,444 233,231 244,645 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 2,264,909 $ 2,230,232 $ 2,439,602 $ 2,443,068 At December 31, 2010, total assets were $2.3 trillion, an increase of $34.7 billion, or two percent, from December 31, 2009. Average total assets in 2010 decreased $3.5 billion from 2009. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities were $2.0 trillion, an increase of $37.9 billion, or two percent, from December 31, 2009. Average total liabilities for 2010 increased $7.9 billion from 2009. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management functions, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation risk appetite. The execution of these functions requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading businesses. One of our key metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets. Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain former qualifying special purpose entities and VIEs that were not recorded on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet prior to that date. The adoption of this new consolidation guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of $100.4 billion, including $69.7 billion resulting from consolidation of credit card trusts and $30.7 billion from consolidation of other special purpose entities including multi-seller conduits, and a net increase of $106.7 billion in total liabilities, including $84.4 billion of long-term debt. These amounts are net of retained interests in securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 and a $10.8 billion increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, the majority of which relates to credit card receivables. The Corporation recorded a $6.2 billion charge, net-of-tax, to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative effect of the adoption of this new consolidation guidance due primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a $116 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). The initial recording of these assets, related allowance for loan and lease losses and liabilities on the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet had no impact at the date of adoption on consolidated results of operations. For additional detail on the impact of adopting this new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Bank of America 2010 29 Table of Contents Assets Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell are utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement. Year-end federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased $19.7 billion and average amounts increased $21.2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009, attributable primarily to a favorable rate environment and increased customer activity. Trading Account Assets Trading account assets consist primarily of fixed-income securities (including government and corporate debt), and equity and convertible instruments. Year-end trading account assets increased $12.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance as well as the consolidation of a VIE late in 2010. Average trading account assets decreased slightly in 2010 as compared to 2009. Debt Securities Debt securities include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, foreign bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create more economically attractive returns on these investments. Year-end and average balances of debt securities increased $26.6 billion and $52.9 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to agency MBS purchases. For additional information on AFS debt securities, see Market Risk Management Securities beginning on page 103 and Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loans and Leases Year-end and average loans and leases increased $40.3 billion to $940.4 billion and $9.5 billion to $958.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance partially offset by continued deleveraging by consumers, tighter underwriting and the elevated levels of liquidity of commercial clients. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management beginning on page 71 and Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Year-end and average allowance for loan lease losses increased $4.7 billion and $12.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the $10.8 billion of reserves recorded on January 1, 2010 in connection with the adoption of new consolidation guidance and reserve additions in the PCI portfolio throughout 2010. These were partially offset by reserve reductions during 2010 due to the impacts of the improving economy. For a more detailed discussion of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses beginning on page 97. All Other Assets Year-end and average other assets decreased $59.7 billion and $71.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 driven primarily by the sale of strategic investments and goodwill impairment charges. Liabilities Deposits Year-end and average deposits increased $18.8 billion to $1.0 trillion and $7.6 billion to $988.6 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was attributable to growth in our noninterest-bearing deposits, NOW and money market accounts primarily driven by affluent, and commercial and corporate clients, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits as a result of customer shift to more liquid products. Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Year-end and average federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $9.8 billion and $16.2 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower funding requirements. Trading Account Liabilities Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in fixed-income securities (including government and corporate debt), equity and convertible instruments. Year-end and average trading account liabilities increased $6.5 billion and $19.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to trading activity in fixed-income securities. Commercial Paper and Other Short-term Borrowings Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings provide a funding source to supplement deposits in our ALM strategy. Year-end and average commercial paper and other short-term borrowings decreased $9.6 billion to $60.0 billion and decreased $42.1 billion to $76.7 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of our strengthened liquidity position. Long-term Debt Year-end and average long-term debt increased by $9.9 billion to $448.4 billion and $43.9 billion to $490.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increases were attributable to the $84.4 billion impact of new consolidation guidance as discussed on page 29 offset by maturities outpacing new issuances and the Corporation strategy to reduce our long-term debt. For additional information on long-term debt, see Note 13 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All Other Liabilities Year-end all other liabilities increased $22.0 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 driven primarily by adoption of new consolidation guidance. Shareholders Equity Year-end and average shareholders equity decreased $3.2 billion and $11.4 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by the goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion and the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance as we recorded a $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings for newly consolidated loans partially offset by changes in accumulated OCI. 30 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Cash Flows Overview The Corporation operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the AFS securities portfolio and other short-term investments. In addition, our financing activities reflect cash flows related to raising customer deposits and issuing long-term debt as well as preferred and common stock. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $12.9 billion during 2010 due to repayment and maturities of certain long-term debt and net purchases of AFS securities partially offset by deposit growth. Cash and cash equivalents increased $88.5 billion during 2009 which reflected our strengthened liquidity. The following discussion outlines the significant activities that impacted our cash flows during 2010 and 2009. During 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $82.6 billion compared to $129.7 billion in 2009. The more significant adjustments to net income (loss) to arrive at cash provided by operating activities included the decreases in the provision for credit losses, decreases in trading and derivative assets, and in 2010, the goodwill impairment charges. During 2010, net cash of $30.3 billion was used in investing activities primarily for net purchases of AFS debt securities. During 2009, net cash provided by investing activities was $157.9 billion, in part, from net sales, pay downs and maturities of AFS securities associated with our management of interest rate risk, and net cash received from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. During 2010, the net cash used in financing activities of $65.4 billion primarily reflected the net decreases in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances. During 2009, net cash used in financing activities was $199.6 billion reflecting the declines in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings due, in part to lower Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) balances as a result of our strong liquidity position and a decrease in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances.

The agreement with FHLMC extinguishes all outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FHLMC through 2008, subject to certain exceptions we do not believe will be material. The agreement with FNMA substantially resolves the existing pipeline of repurchase and make-whole claims outstanding as of September 20, 2010 arising out of alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties related to loans sold directly by legacy Countrywide to FNMA. These agreements with the GSEs do not cover outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make-whole claims arising out of any alleged breaches of selling representations and warranties to legacy Bank of America first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs or other loans sold directly to the GSEs other than described above, loan servicing obligations, other contractual obligations or loans contained in private-label securitizations. As a result of these agreements and associated adjustments made to the representations and warranties liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by the agreements, the Corporation recorded a provision of $3.0 billion during the fourth quarter of 2010. We believe that our remaining exposure to representations and warranties for first-lien residential mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs has been accounted for as a result of these agreements and the associated adjustments to our recorded liability for representations and warranties for first-lien residential mortgage for loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by the agreements as discussed above. We believe our predictive repurchase models, utilizing our historical repurchase experience with the GSEs while considering current developments, including the recent agreements, projections of future defaults as well as certain assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters, allows us to reasonably estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs. However, future provisions for representations and warranties liability to the GSEs may be affected if actual experience is different from our historical experience with the GSEs or our projections of future defaults, and assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters, that are incorporated in the provision calculation. Although our experience with non-GSE claims remains limited, we expect additional activity in this area going forward and that the volume of repurchase claims from monolines, whole-loan investors and investors in private-label securitizations could increase in the future. It is reasonably possible that future losses may occur, and our estimate is that the upper range of possible loss related to non-GSE sales could be $7 billion to $10 billion over existing accruals. This estimate does not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. A significant portion of this estimate relates to loans originated through legacy Countrywide, and the repurchase liability is generally limited to the original seller of the loan. Future provisions and possible loss or range of loss may be impacted if actual results are different from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters and may vary by counterparty. The resolution of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE counterparties will likely be a protracted process, and we will vigorously contest any request for repurchase if we conclude that a valid basis for the repurchase claim does not exist. For additional information about representations and warranties, see Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties beginning on page 52. Goodwill In 2010, we recorded a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in Global Card Services and a $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge in Home Loans & Insurance . These goodwill impairment charges are non-cash, non-tax deductible and have no impact on our reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. Our consumer and small business card products, including the debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within Global Card Services . Based on the provisions of the Financial Reform Act which limit the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to electronic debit interchange, we estimate a revenue loss, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, of approximately $2.0 billion annually based on current volumes and assuming limited mitigation within this segment. Accordingly, we performed a goodwill impairment analysis during the three months ended September 30, 2010. This analysis indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill in Global Card Services was less than the carrying value, and accordingly, we recorded a $10.4 billion charge to reduce the carrying value to fair value. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we performed a goodwill impairment analysis for Home Loans & Insurance as it was likely that there had been a decline in its fair value as a result of increased uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to address servicing needs. This analysis indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill in Home Loans & Insurance was less than the carrying value, and accordingly, we recorded a $2 billion charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in Home Loans & Insurance . For additional information on the goodwill impairment charges, see Complex Accounting Estimates Goodwill and Intangible Assets beginning on page 110 and Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Review of Foreclosure Processes On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in states where foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). On October 8, 2010, we stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an assessment of the related business processes. These actions generally did not affect the initiation and processing of foreclosures prior to judgment, or sale of vacant real estate owned properties. We took these precautionary steps in order to ensure our processes for handling foreclosures include the appropriate controls and quality assurance. Our review has involved an assessment of the foreclosure process, including a review of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending proceedings. As a result of that review, we identified and implemented process and control enhancements, and we intend to monitor ongoing quality results of each process. The process and control enhancements implemented as a result of our review are intended to strengthen the controls related to preparation, execution and notarization of affidavits in judicial states and strengthen our oversight of lawyers in the attorney network who conduct foreclosure proceedings on our behalf, both in judicial states and in states where foreclosures are handled without judicial supervision (non-judicial states). This oversight includes a periodic review of a sample of foreclosure files maintained by these attorneys, and on-site reviews of law firms in the attorney network. In addition, our process and control enhancements for both judicial and non-judicial states include strengthening the controls related to the preparation and execution of other foreclosure loan documentation, including notices of default and pre-foreclosure loss mitigation affidavits, as well as enhanced associate training. After these enhancements were put in place, we resumed foreclosure sales in most non-judicial states during the fourth quarter of 2010, and expect sales to resume in the remaining non-judicial states in the Bank of America 2010 33 Table of Contents first quarter of 2011. We also commenced a rolling process of preparing, as necessary, affidavits of indebtedness in pending foreclosure proceedings in order to resume the process of taking these foreclosure proceedings to judgment in judicial states, beginning with properties believed to be vacant, and with properties for which the mortgage was originated on a non-owner-occupied basis. The process of preparing affidavits in pending proceedings is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2011, and could result in prolonged adversary proceedings that delay certain foreclosure sales. Law enforcement authorities in all 50 states and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other federal agencies, including certain bank supervisory authorities, continue to investigate alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices of residential mortgage servicers. Authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan modification and loss mitigation practices. The Corporation is cooperating with these investigations and is dedicating significant resources to address these issues. The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny has the potential to subject the Corporation to inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect its reputation. Such investigations by state and federal authorities, as well as any other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of our foreclosure processes, could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations and additional litigation. While we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the temporary delay in foreclosure sales, or any issues that may arise as a result of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities, we may be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current foreclosure activities. This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. Our costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2010 and we expect that additional costs incurred in connection with our foreclosure process assessment will continue into 2011 due to the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment, to revise affidavit filings and to implement other operational changes. This will likely result in higher noninterest expense, including higher servicing costs and legal expenses, in Home Loans & Insurance . It is also possible that the temporary suspension in foreclosure sales may result in additional costs and expenses, including costs associated with the maintenance of properties or possible home price declines while foreclosures are delayed. In addition, required process changes could increase our default servicing costs over the longer term. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales may increase temporarily, which may result in an increase in nonperforming loans and servicing advances and may impact the collectability of such advances and the value of our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset, MBS and real estate owned properties. An increase in the time to complete foreclosure sales also may inflate the amount of highly delinquent loans in the Corporation mortgage statistics, result in increasing levels of consumer nonperforming loans, and could have a dampening effect on net interest margin as nonperforming assets increase. Accordingly, delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our continued process enhancements and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure process could increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. Loan sales have not been materially impacted by the temporary delay in foreclosure sales or the review of our foreclosure process. However, delays in foreclosure sales could negatively impact the valuation of our real estate owned properties and MBS that are serviced by us. With respect to agency MBS, while there would be no credit impairment to security holders due to the guarantee provided by the agencies, the valuation of certain MBS could be negatively affected under certain scenarios due to changes in the timing of cash flows. The impact on agency MBS depends on, among other factors, how long the underlying loans are affected by foreclosure delays and would vary among securities. With respect to non-agency MBS, under certain scenarios the timing and amount of cash flows could be negatively affected. The ultimate impact on the non-agency MBS depends on the same factors that impact agency MBS, as well as the level of credit enhancement, including subordination. In addition, as a result of our foreclosure process assessment and related control enhancements that we have implemented, there may continue to be delays in foreclosure sales, including a continued backlog of foreclosure proceedings, and evictions from real estate owned properties. Certain Servicing-related Issues The Corporation and its legacy companies have securitized, and continue to securitize, a significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that we have originated or acquired. The Corporation services a large portion of the loans it or its subsidiaries have securitized and also services loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles. In addition to identifying specific servicing criteria, pooling and servicing arrangements entered into in connection with a securitization or whole loan sale typically impose standards of care on the servicer, with respect to its activities, that may include the obligation to adhere to the accepted servicing practices of prudent mortgage lenders and/or to exercise the degree of care and skill that the servicer employs when servicing loans for its own account. Many non-agency residential mortgage-backed securitizations and whole loan servicing agreements also require the servicer to indemnify the trustee or other investor for or against failures by the servicer to perform its servicing obligations or acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicer duties. Servicing agreements with the GSEs generally provide the GSEs with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. For example, each GSE typically has the right to demand that the servicer repurchase loans that breach the seller representations and warranties made in connection with the initial sale of the loans even if the servicer was not the seller. The GSEs also reserve the contractual right to demand indemnification or loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches although we believe that repurchase or indemnification demands solely for servicing breaches are rare. In addition, our agreements with the GSEs and their first mortgage seller/servicer guides provide for timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded an expense of $230 million for compensatory fees that we expect to be assessed by the GSEs as a result of foreclosure delays. With regard to alleged irregularities in foreclosure process-related activities, a servicer may incur costs or losses if the servicer elects or is required to re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in its capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. The servicer also may incur costs or losses if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, the servicer may have liability to a title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be reimbursable to the servicer. A servicer may also incur costs or losses associated with private-label securitizations or other loan investors relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. The servicer may be subject to deductions by insurers for mortgage insurance or guarantee benefits relating to delays or alleged deficiencies. Additionally, if the servicer commits a material breach of its servicing obligations that is not cured within specified timeframes, including those related to default servicing and foreclosure, it could be terminated as servicer under servicing agreements under certain circumstances. Any of these actions may harm the servicer reputation, increase its servicing costs or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. 34 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Mortgage notes, assignments or other documents are often required to be maintained and are often necessary to enforce mortgage loans. We have processes in place to satisfy document delivery and maintenance requirements in accordance with securitization transaction standards. Additionally, there has been significant public commentary regarding the common industry practice of recording mortgages in the name of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee on behalf of the note holder, and whether securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens securing those loans. We believe that the process for mortgage loan transfers into securitization trusts is based on a well-established body of law that establishes ownership of mortgage loans by the securitization trusts and we believe that we have substantially executed this process. We currently use the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been sold to investors or securitization trusts. Although the GSEs do not require the use of MERS, the GSEs permit standard forms of mortgages and deeds of trust that use MERS and we believe that loans that employ these forms are considered to be properly documented for the GSEs purposes. We believe that the use of MERS is a widespread practice in the industry. Certain legal challenges have been made to the process for transferring mortgage loans to securitization trusts asserting that having a mortgagee of record that is different than the holder of the mortgage note could break the chain of title and cloud the ownership of the loan. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, a securitization trust or other investor should have good title to a mortgage loan if, among other means, either the note is endorsed in blank or to the named transferee and delivered to the holder or its designee, which may be a document custodian. In order to foreclose on a mortgage loan, in certain cases it may be necessary or prudent for an assignment of the mortgage to be made to the holder of the note, which in the case of a mortgage held in the name of MERS as nominee would need to be completed by MERS. As such, our practice is to obtain assignments of mortgages from MERS prior to instituting foreclosure. If certain required documents are missing or defective, or if the use of MERS is found not to be effective, we could be obligated to cure certain defects or in some circumstances otherwise be subject to additional costs and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter, in its capacity as servicer under certain pooling and servicing agreements for 115 private-label residential MBS securitizations (subsequently increased to 225 securitizations) from investors purportedly owning interests in RMBS issued in the securitizations. The letter asserted breaches of certain loan servicing obligations, including an alleged failure to provide notice to the trustee and other parties to the pooling and servicing agreements of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to mortgage loans included in the securitization transactions. On November 4, 2010, the servicer responded in writing to the letter, stating among other things that the letter had identified no facts indicating that the servicer had breached any of its obligations, and asking that the signatories of the letter provide evidence that they met the minimum voting interest requirements for investor action contained in the relevant contracts. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP and Gibbs & Bruns LLP on behalf of certain investors including those who signed the letter, as well as The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, have agreed to a short extension of any time periods commenced by the letter to permit the parties to explore dialogue around the issues raised. There are a number of questions about the validity of the assertions set forth in the letter, including whether these purported investors have standing to bring these claims. The servicer intends to challenge the assertions in the letter and to fully enforce its rights under the relevant contracts. For additional information about representations and warranties, see Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Representations and Warranties beginning on page 52 and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Bank of America 2010 35 Table of Contents Supplemental Financial Data We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratio and net interest yield) on a FTE basis. Although these are non-GAAP measures, we believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points we are earning over the cost of funds. During our annual planning process, we set efficiency targets for the Corporation and each line of business. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business, competitive environment, market factors and other items including our risk appetite. We also evaluate our business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities (CES) less goodwill and intangible assets, (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders equity plus any CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding plus the number of common shares issued upon conversion of common equivalent shares. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use ROTE as key measures to support our overall growth goals. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7 and Statistical Tables XII and XIV. In addition, in Table 7 and Statistical Table XIV, we have excluded the impact of goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion recorded in 2010 when presenting earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common shareholders equity, return on average tangible common shareholders equity and ROTE. Accordingly, these are non-GAAP measures. Statistical Tables XIII and XV provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently.

(2) Performance ratios are calculated excluding the impact of goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion recorded during 2010. 36 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Core Net Interest Income We manage core net interest income which is reported net interest income on a FTE basis adjusted for the impact of market-based activities. As discussed in the GBAM business segment section beginning on page 45, we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for GBAM. In addition, 2009 is presented on a managed basis which is adjusted for loans that we originated and subsequently sold into credit card securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses, was recorded for securitized assets as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and we recorded servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where appropriate. 2010 is presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. An analysis of core net interest income, core average earning assets and core net interest yield on earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of these two non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Table 8 Core Net Interest Income (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Net interest income (1) As reported (2) $ 52,693 $ 48,410 Impact of market-based net interest income (3) (4,430 ) (6,117 ) Core net interest income 48,263 42,293 Impact of securitizations (4) n/a 10,524 Core net interest income 48,263 52,817 Average earning assets As reported 1,897,573 1,830,193 Impact of market-based earning assets (3) (504,360 ) (481,376 ) Core average earning assets 1,393,213 1,348,817 Impact of securitizations (5) n/a 83,640 Core average earning assets 1,393,213 1,432,457 Net interest yield contribution (1) As reported (2) 2.78 % 2.65 % Impact of market-based activities (3) 0.68 0.49 Core net interest yield on earning assets 3.46 3.14 Impact of securitizations n/a 0.55 Core net interest yield on earning assets 3.46 % 3.69 % (1) FTE basis (2) Balance and calculation include fees earned on overnight deposits placed with the Federal Reserve of $368 million and $379 million for 2010 and 2009.

(4) Represents the impact of securitizations utilizing actual bond costs which is different from the business segment view which utilizes funds transfer pricing methodologies. (5) Represents average securitized loans less accrued interest receivable and certain securitized bonds retained. n/a = not applicable Core net interest income decreased $4.6 billion to $48.3 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was driven by lower loan levels compared to managed loan levels in 2009, and lower yields for the discretionary and credit card portfolios. These impacts were partially offset by lower rates on deposits. Core average earning assets decreased $39.2 billion to $1.4 trillion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower commercial loan levels and lower consumer loan levels compared to managed consumer loan levels in 2009. The impact was partially offset by increased securities levels in 2010. Core net interest yield decreased 23 bps to 3.46 percent for 2010 compared to 2009 due to the factors noted above. Bank of America 2010 37 Table of Contents Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation We report the results of our operations through six business segments: Deposits, Global Card Services, Home Loans & Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, GBAM and GWIM , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned the Global Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the former Global Banking segment with the former Global Markets business segment to form GBAM and to reflect Global Commercial Banking as a standalone segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP methodologies and performance measures, many of which are discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 36. In addition, return on average tangible shareholders equity for the segments is calculated as net income, excluding goodwill impairment charges, divided by average allocated equity less goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets (excluding MSRs). We begin by evaluating the operating results of the segments which by definition exclude merger and restructuring charges. The management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to a FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. For presentation purposes, in segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets to match liabilities. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by our ALM activities. Our ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. Our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect net interest income. Our ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on performance. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, strategic and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page 59. We benefit from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. The total amount of average equity reflects both risk-based capital and the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the business segments.

In addition, Deposits includes an allocation of ALM activities. In the U.S., we serve approximately 57 million consumer and small business relationships through a franchise that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia utilizing our network of approximately 5,900 banking centers, 18,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading online and mobile banking platforms. At December 31, 2010, our active online banking customer base was 29.3 million subscribers compared to 29.6 million at December 31, 2009, and our active bill pay users paid $304.3 billion of bills online during 2010 compared to $302.4 billion in 2009. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest-and interest-bearing checking accounts. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees. Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between GWIM and Deposits . For more information on the migration of customer balances, see GWIM beginning on page 48. Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for existing customers. These rules partially impacted the third quarter of 2010 and fully impacted the fourth quarter of 2010. In late 2009, we implemented changes in our overdraft policies which negatively impacted revenue. These changes were intended to help customers limit overdraft fees. For more information on Regulation E, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56. Net income fell $1.2 billion, or 48 percent, to $1.4 billion due to lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.0 billion, or 15 percent, to $8.1 billion as a result of a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline, partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Average deposits increased $4.2 billion from a year ago due to the transfer of certain deposits from other client managed businesses and organic growth, partially offset by the expected run-off of higher-cost legacy Countrywide deposits. Noninterest income fell $1.7 billion, or 26 percent, to $5.1 billion, primarily driven by the decline in service charges due to the implementation of Regulation E and the impact of our overdraft policy changes. The impact of Regulation E, which was in effect beginning in the third quarter and fully in effect in the fourth quarter of 2010, and overdraft policy changes, which were in effect for the full year of 2010, was a reduction in service charges during 2010 of approximately $1.7 billion. In 2011, the incremental reduction to service charges related to Regulation E and overdraft policy changes is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, or a full-year impact of approximately $2.8 billion, net of identified mitigation actions. Noninterest expense increased $1.3 billion, or 14 percent, to $10.8 billion as a result of a higher proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts being aligned to Deposits from the other consumer segments and increased litigation expenses in 2010.

We provide credit card products to customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Spain and the U.K. We offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit and debit card products and are one of the leading issuers of credit cards through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe. On February 22, 2010, the majority of the provisions of the CARD Act became effective and negatively impacted net interest income during 2010 due to restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk and on card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 full-year impact on revenue was approximately $1.5 billion. For more information on the CARD Act, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56. The Corporation reports its Global Card Services results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Under this new consolidation guidance, we consolidated all credit card trusts on January 1, 2010. Accordingly, current year results are comparable to prior year results that are presented on a managed basis. For more information on managed basis, refer to Note 26 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on the new consolidation guidance, refer to Balance Sheet Overview Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance beginning on page 29 and Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the Financial Reform Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, we believe that our debit card revenue in Global Card Services will be adversely impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2011. Based on 2010 volumes, our estimate of revenue loss due to the debit card interchange fee standards to be adopted under the Financial Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually. This estimate resulted in a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge for Global Card Services . Depending on the final rulemaking under the Durbin Amendment, additional goodwill impairment may occur in Global Card Services . For additional information, refer to Regulatory Matters Debit Interchange Fees on page 57 and Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on page 107. Global Card Services recorded a net loss of $6.6 billion primarily due to the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in 2010. Excluding this charge, Global Card Services would have reported net income of $3.8 billion compared to a net loss of $5.3 billion in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses. Revenue decreased $3.4 billion, or 12 percent, to $25.6 billion, driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording an incremental reserve of $592 million for future payment protection insurance claims in the U.K. that have not yet been asserted. For more information on payment protection insurance, refer to Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net interest income decreased $2.2 billion, or 11 percent, to $17.8 billion as average loans decreased $35.7 billion partially offset by lower funding costs. The decline in average loans was due to the elevated level of net charge-offs and risk mitigation strategies that were implemented throughout the recent economic cycle. Noninterest income decreased $1.3 billion, or 14 percent, to $7.8 billion driven by lower card income primarily due to the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording a reserve related to future payment protection insurance claims. The decrease was partially offset by higher interchange income during 2010 and the gain on the sale of our MasterCard equity holdings. Provision for credit losses improved $16.9 billion due to lower delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic environment. This resulted in reserve reductions of $7.0 billion in 2010 compared to reserve increases of $3.4 billion in 2009. The prior year included a reserve addition due to maturing securitizations which had an unfavorable impact on the 2009 provision expense. In addition, net charge-offs declined $6.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion, noninterest expense decreased $773 million primarily driven by a higher proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts being aligned to Deposits from Global Card Services . 40 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Home Loans & Insurance (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Net interest income (1) $ 4,690 $ 4,975 (6 )% Noninterest income: Mortgage banking income 3,079 9,321 (67 ) Insurance income 2,257 2,346 (4 ) All other income 621 261 138 Total noninterest income 5,957 11,928 (50 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense 10,647 16,903 (37 ) Provision for credit losses 8,490 11,244 (24 ) Goodwill impairment 2,000 n/m All other noninterest expense 13,163 11,705 12 Loss before income taxes (13,006 ) (6,046 ) (115 ) Income tax benefit (1) (4,085 ) (2,195 ) (86 ) Net loss $ (8,921 ) $ (3,851 ) (132 ) Net interest yield (1) 2.52 % 2.58 % Efficiency ratio (1) 142.42 69.25 Efficiency ratio, excluding goodwill impairment charge (1) 123.63 69.25 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 129,236 $ 130,519 (1 )% Total earning assets 186,455 193,152 (3 ) Total assets 226,352 230,123 (2 ) Allocated equity 26,170 20,530 27 Year end Total loans and leases $ 122,935 $ 131,302 (6 )% Total earning assets 173,033 188,349 (8 ) Total assets 213,455 232,588 (8 ) Allocated equity 23,542 27,148 (13 ) (1) FTE basis n/m = not meaningful Home Loans & Insurance generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. Home Loans & Insurance products are available to our customers through a retail network of 5,900 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in approximately 750 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products are also offered through our correspondent loan acquisition channels. On February 4, 2011, we announced that we are exiting the reverse mortgage origination business. In October 2010, we exited the first mortgage wholesale acquisition channel. These strategic changes were made to allow greater focus on our retail and correspondent channels. Home Loans & Insurance products include fixed and adjustable-rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet in All Other for ALM purposes. Home Loans & Insurance is not impacted by the Corporation first mortgage production retention decisions as Home Loans & Insurance is compensated for the decision on a management accounting basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other . Funded home equity lines of credit and home equity loans are held on the Home Loans & Insurance balance sheet. In addition, Home Loans & Insurance offers property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance. On February 3, 2011, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell the lender-placed and voluntary property and casualty insurance assets and liabilities of Balboa Insurance Company (Balboa) and affiliated entities for an upfront cash payment of approximately $700 million, subject to certain closing and other adjustments, as well as additional future payments. Balboa is a wholly-owned subsidiary and part of Home Loans & Insurance . Home Loans & Insurance includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between GWIM and Home Loans & Insurance based on client segmentation thresholds. For more information on the migration of customer balances, see GWIM beginning on page 48. Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of $8.9 billion compared to a net loss of $3.9 billion in 2009 primarily due to an increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties provision and the $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2010, partially offset by a decline in provision for credit losses of $2.8 billion. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties on page 52. Provision for credit losses decreased $2.8 billion to $8.5 billion driven by improving portfolio trends which led to lower reserve additions, including those associated with the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $3.5 billion primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and default-related and other loss mitigation expenses, partially offset by lower production expense and insurance losses. See Complex Accounting Estimates Goodwill and Intangible Assets beginning on page 110 and Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the goodwill impairment charge for Home Loans & Insurance. Bank of America 2010 41 Table of Contents Mortgage Banking Income Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income is categorized into production and servicing income. Production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held-for-sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes revenue, which is eliminated in All Other, for transfers of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporation mortgage production retention decisions. Servicing income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of economic hedge activities. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties. Our home retention efforts are also part of our servicing activities, along with responding to customer inquiries and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. In an effort to avoid foreclosure, Bank of America evaluates various workout options prior to foreclosure sale which has resulted in elongated default timelines. Our servicing agreements with certain loan investors require us to comply with usual and customary standards in the liquidation of delinquent mortgage loans. Our agreements with the GSEs provide timelines to complete the liquidation of delinquent loans. In instances where we fail to meet these timelines, our agreements provide the GSEs with the option to assess compensatory fees. In 2010, the Corporation recorded an expense of approximately $230 million for estimated compensatory fees that it expects to be assessed by the GSEs as a result of foreclosure delays. Additionally, we may face demands and claims from private-label securitization investors concerning alleged breaches of customary servicing standards. For additional information on our servicing activities, see Recent Events Certain Servicing-related Issues beginning on page 34. On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter, in its capacity as servicer under certain pooling and servicing agreements for 115 private-label residential MBS securitizations (subsequently increased to 225 securitizations). The letter asserted breaches of certain servicing obligations. For additional information, see Recent Events Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters on page 35. The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income. Mortgage Banking Income (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Production income: Core production revenue $ 6,098 $ 7,352 Representations and warranties provision (6,786 ) (1,851 ) Total production income (loss) (688 ) 5,501 Servicing income: Servicing fees 6,475 6,219 Impact of customer payments (1) (3,760 ) (4,491 ) Fair value changes of MSRs, net of economic hedge results (2) 376 1,539 Other servicing-related revenue 676 553 Total net servicing income 3,767 3,820 Total Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income 3,079 9,321 Other business segments mortgage banking loss (3) (345 ) (530 ) Total consolidated mortgage banking income $ 2,734 $ 8,791 (1) Represents the change in the market value of the MSR asset due to the impact of customer payments received during the year. (2) Includes sale of MSRs. (3) Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to the ALM portfolio in All Other . The production loss of $688 million represented a decrease of $6.2 billion as representations and warranties provision increased $4.9 billion to $6.8 billion which includes provision of $3.0 billion related to the GSE agreements as well as adjustments to the representations and warranties liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those agreements. Also contributing to the representations and warranties provision for the year was our continued evaluation of non-GSE exposure to repurchases and similar claims, which led to the determination that we have developed sufficient repurchase experience with certain non-GSE counterparties to record a liability related to existing and future projected claims from such counterparties. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Recent Events Representations and Warranties Liability on page 33 and Representations and Warranties beginning on page 52. In addition, core production revenue, which excludes representations and warranties provision, declined $1.3 billion due to a decline in volume driven by a drop in the overall size of the mortgage market and a decline in market share. Net servicing income remained relatively flat as lower MSR results, net of hedges, were offset by a lower impact of customer payments and higher fee income. For additional information on MSRs and the related hedge instruments, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 106. 42 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Home Loans & Insurance Key Statistics (Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2010 2009 Loan production Home Loans & Insurance: First mortgage $ 287,236 $ 354,506 Home equity 7,626 10,488 Total Corporation (1) : First mortgage 298,038 378,105 Home equity 8,437 13,214 Year end Mortgage servicing portfolio (in billions) (2) $ 2,057 $ 2,151 Mortgage loans serviced for investors (in billions) 1,628 1,716 Mortgage servicing rights: Balance 14,900 19,465 Capitalized mortgage servicing rights (% of loans serviced for investors) 92 bps 113 bps (1) In addition to loan production in Home Loans & Insurance , the remaining first mortgage and home equity loan production is primarily in GWIM. (2) Servicing of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and discontinued real estate mortgage loans. First mortgage production in Home Loans & Insurance was $287.2 billion in 2010 compared to $354.5 billion in 2009. The decrease of $67.3 billion was primarily due to a drop in the overall size of the mortgage market driven by weaker market demand for both refinance and purchase transactions combined with a decrease in market share. Home equity production was $7.6 billion in 2010 compared to $10.5 billion in 2009. The decrease of $2.9 billion was primarily due to more stringent underwriting guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans as well as lower consumer demand. At December 31, 2010, the consumer MSR balance was $14.9 billion, which represented 92 bps of the related unpaid principal balance compared to $19.5 billion, or 113 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2009. The decrease in the consumer MSR balance was driven by the impact of declining mortgage rates partially offset by the addition of new MSRs recorded in connection with sales of loans. In addition, elevated servicing costs, due to higher personnel expenses associated with default-related servicing activities, reduced expected cash flows. These factors together resulted in the 21 bps decrease in capitalized MSRs as a percentage of loans serviced.

Our clients include business banking and middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and governments, and are generally defined as companies with annual sales up to $2 billion. Our lending products and services include commercial loans and commitment facilities, real estate lending, asset-based lending and indirect consumer loans. Our capital management and treasury solutions include treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options. Global Commercial Banking recorded 2010 net income of $3.2 billion compared to a 2009 net loss of $290 million, with the improvement driven by lower credit costs. Net interest income remained relatively flat as growth in average deposits from our existing clients of $18.7 billion, or 14 percent, was offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. In addition, net interest income benefited from credit pricing discipline, which negated the impact of the $25.8 billion, or 11 percent, decline in average loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $270 million, or nine percent, largely due to additional costs related to our agreement to purchase certain retail automotive loans. For further information, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The provision for credit losses decreased $5.8 billion to $2.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was driven by improvements primarily in the commercial real estate portfolios reflecting stabilizing values and in the U.S. commercial portfolio resulting from improved borrower credit profiles. Additionally, all other portfolios experienced lower net charge-offs attributable to more stable economic conditions. Global Commercial Banking Revenue Global Commercial Banking revenues can also be categorized as treasury services revenue primarily from capital and treasury management, and business lending revenue derived from credit related products and services. Treasury services revenue for 2010 was $4.3 billion, an increase of $62 million compared to 2009. Revenue growth was driven by net interest income from increased deposits, partially offset by lower treasury service charges. As clients manage through current economic conditions, we have seen usage of certain treasury services decline and increased conversion of paper to electronic services. These actions combined with our clients leveraging compensating balances to offset fees have decreased treasury service charges. Business lending revenue for 2010 was $6.6 billion, a decrease of $299 million compared to 2009, largely due to additional costs related to our agreement to purchase certain retail automotive loans. Despite client deleveraging in the first half of 2010 and continued low loan demand, commercial and industrial loan balances began to stabilize and show moderate growth during the latter part of 2010. Commercial real estate loan balances declined due to continued client deleveraging and our management of nonperforming loans. Credit pricing discipline negated the impact of the decline in average loan balances on net interest income. 44 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Global Banking & Markets (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 % Change Net interest income (1) $ 7,989 $ 9,553 (16 )% Noninterest income: Service charges 2,126 2,044 4 Investment and brokerage services 2,441 2,662 (8 ) Investment banking income 5,408 5,927 (9 ) Trading account profits 9,689 11,803 (18 ) All other income 845 634 33 Total noninterest income 20,509 23,070 (11 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense 28,498 32,623 (13 ) Provision for credit losses (155 ) 1,998 (108 ) Noninterest expense 18,038 15,921 13 Income before income taxes 10,615 14,704 (28 ) Income tax expense (1) 4,296 4,646 (8 ) Net income $ 6,319 $ 10,058 (37 ) Return on average equity 12.01 % 20.32 % Return on average tangible shareholders equity 15.05 25.82 Efficiency ratio (1) 63.30 48.80 Balance Sheet Average Total trading-related assets $ 499,433 $ 508,163 (2 )% Total loans and leases 98,604 110,811 (11 ) Total market-based earning assets 504,360 481,376 5 Total earning assets 598,613 588,252 2 Total assets 758,958 778,870 (3 ) Total deposits 109,792 104,868 5 Allocated equity 52,604 49,502 6 Year end Total trading-related assets $ 413,563 $ 410,755 1 % Total loans and leases 100,010 95,930 4 Total market-based earning assets 416,174 404,315 3 Total earning assets 509,269 498,765 2 Total assets 655,535 649,876 1 Total deposits 111,447 102,093 9 Allocated equity 49,054 53,260 (8 ) (1) FTE basis GBAM provides financial products, advisory services, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities.

GBAM also includes the results of our merchant processing joint venture, Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC. In 2009, we entered into a joint venture agreement with First Data Corporation (First Data) to form Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC. The joint venture provides payment solutions, including credit, debit and prepaid cards, and check and e-commerce payments to merchants ranging from small businesses to corporate and commercial clients worldwide. In addition to Bank of America and First Data, the remaining stake was initially held by a third party. During 2010, the third party sold its interest to the joint venture, thus increasing the Corporation ownership interest in the joint venture to 49 percent. For additional information on the joint venture agreement, see Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income decreased $3.7 billion to $6.3 billion due to a $4.1 billion decline in revenues and an increase in noninterest expenses of $2.1 billion. This was partially offset by lower provision expense reflecting improvement in borrower credit profiles. Additionally, income tax expense was negatively affected from a change in the U.K. corporate income tax rate that impacted the carrying value of the deferred tax asset by approximately $390 million. Net interest income decreased $1.6 billion to $8.0 billion due to tighter spreads on trading related assets and lower average loan and lease balances, partially offset by higher earned spreads on deposits. The $12.2 billion, or 11 percent, decline in average loans and leases was driven by reduced client demand. Net interest income is comprised of both markets-based revenue Bank of America 2010 45 Table of Contents from our trading activities and banking-based revenue which is related to our credit and treasury service products. Noninterest income decreased $2.6 billion due in part to the prior year gain of $3.8 billion related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture. While overall sales and trading revenue were flat year-over-year, the market in 2009 was more favorable but results were muted by losses on legacy positions. Noninterest expense increased $2.1 billion driven mainly by higher compensation costs from investments in infrastructure, professional fees and litigations expense. Components of Global Banking & Markets Sales and Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income including investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), RMBS and CDOs; currencies including interest rate and foreign exchange contracts; commodities including primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options; and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

(2) Includes $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion of investment and brokerage services revenue for 2010 and 2009. Sales and trading revenue decreased $322 million, or two percent, to $17.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased investor risk aversion and more favorable market conditions in the prior year. We recorded net credit spread gains on derivative liabilities during 2010 of $242 million compared to losses of $801 million in 2009. FICC revenue increased $435 million to $13.2 billion due to significantly lower market disruption charges, partially offset by lower revenue in our rates and currencies, commodities and credit products due to diminished client activity and European debt deterioration. Gains on legacy assets, primarily in trading account profits (losses) and other income (loss), were $321 million for 2010 compared to write-downs of $3.8 billion in 2009. Legacy losses in the prior year were primarily driven by our CMBS, CDO and leveraged finance exposure. Equity income was $4.1 billion in 2010 compared to $4.9 billion in 2009 driven by a decline in client flows and market conditions in the derivatives business. Investment Banking Income Product specialists within GBAM underwrite and distribute debt and equity issuances and certain other loan products, and provide advisory services. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking income, the table below presents total investment banking income for the Corporation of which, 93 percent in 2010 and 94 percent in 2009 is recorded in GBAM with the remainder reported in GWIM and Global Commercial Banking.

(2) Represents the offset to fees paid on the Corporation transactions. Equity issuance fees decreased $465 million in 2010 primarily reflecting lower levels of industry-wide activity and a decline in market-based revenue pools. Debt issuance fees increased $143 million consistent with a five percent increase in global fee pools in 2010. Strong performance within debt issuance was mainly driven by higher revenues within leveraged finance. Advisory fees decreased $148 million during 2010. Global Corporate Banking Client relationship teams along with product partners work with our customers to provide them with a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions through the Corporation global network of offices. Global Corporate Banking lending revenues of $3.4 billion for 2010 increased $567 million compared to 2009. The increase in 2010 is primarily due to higher fees and the negative impact of hedge results in 2009. Treasury services revenue of $2.8 billion for 2010 decreased $3.9 billion primarily due to a $3.8 billion pre-tax gain in the prior year related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to a joint venture. Equity investment income from the joint venture was $133 million for 2010. During 2010, we sold our trust administration business and in connection with the sale provided certain commitments to the acquirer. See Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 46 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. Our CDO-related exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts), warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information on our CDO positions, see Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities issued by the CDO vehicles. In 2010, we incurred $573 million of losses resulting from our CDO-related exposure compared to $2.2 billion in CDO-related losses in 2009. This included $357 million in 2010 related to counterparty risk on our CDO-related exposure compared to $910 million in 2009. Also included in these losses were other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) write-downs of $251 million in 2010 compared to losses of $1.2 billion in 2009 related to CDOs and retained positions classified as AFS debt securities. As presented in the table below, at December 31, 2010, our hedged and unhedged super senior CDO exposure before consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was $2.0 billion compared to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2009.

(2) Includes highly-rated collateralized loan obligations and CMBS super senior exposure. (3) Hedged amounts are presented at carrying value before consideration of the insurance. We value our CDO structures using market-standard models to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each deal. Key inputs to the models are prepayment rates, default rates and severities for each collateral type, and other relevant contractual features. Unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI on super senior cash positions and retained positions from liquidated CDOs in aggregate decreased $382 million during 2010 to $466 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, total super senior exposure of $2.0 billion was marked at 18 percent, including $156 million of retained positions from liquidated CDOs marked at 42 percent, $527 million of non-subprime exposure marked at 39 percent and the remaining $1.3 billion of subprime exposure marked at 14 percent of the original exposure amounts. The table below presents our original total notional, mark-to-market receivable and credit valuation adjustment for credit default swaps and other positions with monolines. The receivable for super senior CDOs reflects hedge gains recorded from inception of the contracts in connection with write-downs on the super senior CDOs in the table above.

This decrease was driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline contracts. Other CDO Exposure With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan with a carrying value of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs. Merrill Lynch originally provided financing to the borrower for an amount equal to approximately 75 percent of the fair value of the collateral. The loan, which is recorded in All Other , has full recourse to the borrower and all scheduled payments on the loan have been received. Events of default under the loan are customary events of default, including failure to pay interest when due and failure to pay principal at maturity. Collateral for the loan is excluded from our CDO exposure discussions and the applicable tables.

MLGWM advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of approximately 15,500 financial advisors focused on clients with more than $250,000 in total investable assets. MLGWM also includes Merrill Edge, a new integrated investing and banking service which is targeted at clients with less than $250,000 in total assets. Merrill Edge provides team-based investment advice and guidance, brokerage services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation branch network and ATMs. In addition, MLGWM includes the Private Banking & Investments Group. U.S. Trust , together with MLGWM Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted at wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $5 million, as well as customized solutions to meet clients wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. Retirement Services partners with financial advisors to provide institutional and personal retirement solutions including investment management, administration, recordkeeping and custodial services for 401(k), pension, profit-sharing, equity award and non-qualified deferred compensation plans . Retirement Services also provides comprehensive investment advisory services to individuals, small to large corporations and pension plans. Included in Retirement Services results is the consolidation of a collective investment fund that did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results. For additional information, see Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. GWIM results also include the BofA Global Capital Management (BACM) business, which is comprised primarily of the cash and liquidity asset management business that Bank of America retained following the sale of the Columbia Management long-term asset management business on May 1, 2010. The historical results of Columbia Management long-term asset management business were transferred to All Other along with the Corporation economic ownership interest in BlackRock. Revenue from MLGWM was $13.1 billion, up four percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenue from U.S. Trust was $2.7 billion, up five percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Revenue from Retirement Services was $950 million, up four percent compared to 2009. 48 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents GWIM results include the impact of migrating clients and their related deposit and loan balances to or from Deposits , Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio as presented in the table below. The directional shift of total deposits migrated was mainly due to client segmentation threshold changes. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the clients migrated. Migration Summary (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Average Total deposits GWIM from (to) Deposits $ 3,086 $ (30,638 ) Total loans GWIM to Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio (1,405 ) (12,033 ) Year end Total deposits GWIM from (to) Deposits $ 7,232 $ (42,521 ) Total loans GWIM to Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio (1,625 ) (17,241 ) Net income decreased $369 million, or 22 percent, to $1.3 billion driven in part by higher noninterest expense, the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia Management long-term asset management business and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs. Net interest income decreased $157 million, or three percent, to $5.8 billion as the positive impact of higher deposit levels was more than offset by lower revenue from corporate ALM activity. Noninterest income increased $691 million, or seven percent, to $10.8 billion primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by stronger markets, continued long-term assets under management flows and higher transactional activity. Provision for credit losses decreased $415 million, or 39 percent, to $646 million driven by stabilization of the portfolios and the recognition of a single large commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $1.2 billion, or 10 percent, to $13.6 billion driven by increases in revenue-related expenses, higher support costs and personnel costs associated with further investment in the business. Client Balances The table below presents client balances which consist of assets under management, client brokerage assets, assets in custody, client deposits, and loans and leases.

(2) 2009 balance includes the Columbia Management long-term asset management business representing $114.6 billion, net of eliminations, which was sold on May 1, 2010. The decrease in client balances was due to the sale of the Columbia Management long-term asset management business, outflows in MLGWM non-fee based brokerage assets and outflows in BACM money market assets due to the continued low rate environment, partially offset by higher market levels and inflows in client deposits, long-term assets under management (AUM) and fee-based brokerage assets.

The 2009 presentation above of All Other excludes the securitization offset to make it comparable with the 2010 presentation. In 2009, Global Card Services was presented on a managed basis with the difference between managed and held reported as the securitization offset. With the adoption of new consolidation guidance on January 1, 2010, we consolidated all credit card securitizations that were previously unconsolidated, such that All Other no longer includes the securitization offset. For additional information on the securitization offset included in All Other , see Note 26 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All Other , as presented above, consists of two broad groupings, Equity Investments and Other. Equity Investments includes Corporate Investments, Global Principal Investments and Strategic Investments. Other can be segregated into the following categories: liquidating businesses, merger and restructuring charges, ALM functions (i.e., residential mortgage portfolio and investment securities) and related activities (i.e., economic hedges, fair value option on structured liabilities), and the impact of certain allocation methodologies. For additional information on the other activities included in All Other , see Note 26 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The tables below present the components of All Other equity investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and also a reconciliation of All Other equity investment income to the total consolidated equity investment income for 2010 and 2009. Equity Investments December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Corporate Investments $ $ 2,731 Global Principal Investments 11,656 14,071 Strategic and other investments 22,545 27,838 Total equity investments included in All Other $ 34,201 $ 44,640 Equity Investment Income (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Corporate Investments $ (293 ) $ (88 ) Global Principal Investments 2,304 1,222 Strategic and other investments 2,521 9,455 Total equity investment income included in All Other 4,532 10,589 Total equity investment income included in the business segments 728 (575 ) Total consolidated equity investment income $ 5,260 $ 10,014 50 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents In 2010, the $2.7 billion Corporate Investments equity securities portfolio, which consisted of highly liquid publicly-traded equity securities, was sold as a result of a change in our investment portfolio objectives shifting more to interest earnings and reducing our exposure to equity market risk, which contributed to the $293 million loss in 2010. Global Principal Investments (GPI) is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. GPI had unfunded equity commitments of $1.4 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, related to certain of these investments. During 2010, we sold our exposure of $2.9 billion in certain private equity funds, comprised of $1.5 billion in funded exposure and $1.4 billion in unfunded commitments in these funds as we continue to reduce our equity exposure. Affiliates of the Corporation may, from time to time, act as general partner, fund manager and/or investment advisor to certain Corporation-sponsored real estate private equity funds. In this capacity, these affiliates manage and/or provide investment advisory services to such real estate private equity funds primarily for the benefit of third-party institutional and private clients. These activities, which are recorded in GPI, inherently involve risk to us and to the fund investors, and in certain situations may result in losses. In 2010, we recorded a loss of $163 million related to a consolidated real estate private equity fund for which we were the general partner and investment advisor. In late 2010, the general partner and investment advisor responsibilities were transferred to an independent third-party asset manager. Strategic Investments includes primarily our investment in CCB of $19.7 billion as well as our $2.6 billion remaining investment in BlackRock. At December 31, 2010, we owned approximately 10 percent, or 25.6 billion common shares of CCB. During 2010, we sold certain rights related to our investment in CCB resulting in a gain of $432 million. Also during 2010, we sold our Ita Unibanco and Santander equity investments resulting in a net gain of approximately $800 million and a portion of our interest in BlackRock resulting in a gain of $91 million. All Other reported net income of $1.1 billion in 2010 compared to $1.3 billion in 2009 with the decline due to decreases in net interest income and noninterest income compared to the prior year. The decrease in net interest income was driven by a $1.4 billion lower funding differential on certain securitizations and the impact of capital raises occurring throughout 2009 that were not allocated to the businesses. Noninterest income decreased $4.9 billion, as the prior year included a $7.3 billion gain resulting from sales of shares of CCB and an increase of $1.4 billion on net gains on the sale of debt securities. This was offset by net negative fair value adjustments of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities in 2009 compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010 and higher valuation adjustments and gains on sales of select investments in GPI. Also in 2010, we sold our investments in Ita Unibanco and Santander resulting in a net gain of approximately $800 million, as well as the gains on CCB and BlackRock. For more information on the sales of these investments, see Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provision for credit losses decreased $3.4 billion to $4.6 billion due to improving portfolio trends in the residential mortgage portfolio partially offset by further deterioration in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired discontinued real estate portfolio. The income tax benefit in 2010 was $4.1 billion compared to $2.4 billion in 2009, driven by an increase in the pre-tax loss as well as the release of a higher portion of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. During 2010, we completed the sale of First Republic at book value and as a result, we removed $17.4 billion of loans and $17.8 billion of deposits from the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time are defined as purchase obligations. Included in purchase obligations are commitments to purchase loans of $2.6 billion and vendor contracts of $7.1 billion. The most significant vendor contracts include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plans, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans assets and any participant contributions, if applicable. During 2010 and 2009, we contributed $378 million and $414 million to the Plans, and we expect to make at least $306 million of contributions during 2011. Debt, lease, equity and other obligations are more fully discussed in Note 13 Long-term Debt and Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Plans are more fully discussed in Note 19 Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see the table in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedy to a whole-loan buyer or securitization trust (collectively, repurchase claims). Our operations are currently structured to attempt to limit the risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by seeking to ensure consistent production of mortgages in accordance with our underwriting procedures and by servicing those mortgages consistent with our contractual obligations. The fair value of probable losses to be absorbed under the representations and warranties obligations and the guarantees is recorded as an accrued liability when the loans are sold. The liability for probable losses is updated by accruing a representations and warranties provision in mortgage banking income. This is done throughout the life of the loan as necessary when additional relevant information becomes available. The methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors, which include, depending on the counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, estimated probability that a repurchase request will be received, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. Historical experience also considers recent events such as the agreements with the GSEs on December 31, 2010 as discussed in the following section. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability. Given that these factors vary by counterparty, we analyze our representations and warranties obligations based on the specific counterparty with whom the sale was made. Although the timing and volume has varied, we have experienced in recent periods increasing repurchase and similar requests from buyers and insurers, including monolines. Generally the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not significant because the requests are limited in number and are typically resolved quickly. We expect that efforts to attempt to assert repurchase requests by monolines, whole-loan investors and private-label securitization investors may increase in the future. See Recent Events Private-label Residential Mortgage-backed Securities Matters, on page 35 for additional information. We perform a loan-by-loan review of all properly presented repurchase claims and have and will continue to contest such demands that we do not believe are valid. In addition, we may reach a bulk settlement with a counterparty (in lieu of the loan-by-loan review process), on terms determined to be advantageous to the Corporation. Overall, disputes with respect to repurchase claims have increased with monoline insurers, whole-loan buyers and private-label securitization investors. For additional information, see Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010, our total unresolved repurchase claims totaled approximately $10.7 billion compared to $7.6 billion at the end of 2009. The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the liability was $5.4 billion and $3.5 billion. For 2010 and 2009, the provision for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees was $6.8 billion and $1.9 billion. The representations and warranties provision of $6.8 billion, includes a provision of $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to the GSE agreements as well as adjustments to the representations and warranties liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those agreements. Also contributing to the increase in representations and warranties provision for the year was our continued evaluation of exposure to non-GSE repurchases and similar claims, which led to the determination that we have developed sufficient repurchase experience with certain non-GSE counterparties to record a liability related to existing and future projected claims from such counterparties. Representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase claims presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase claims and other relevant facts and circumstances, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings for any particular period. Government-sponsored Enterprises During the last ten years, Bank of America and our subsidiaries have sold over $2.0 trillion of loans to the GSEs and we have an established history of working with them on repurchase claims. Our experience with them continues to evolve and any disputes are generally related to areas such as the reasonableness of stated income, occupancy and undisclosed liabilities, and are typically focused on the 2004 through 2008 vintages. On December 31, 2010, we reached agreements with the GSEs and paid $2.8 billion to the GSEs pursuant to such agreements, resolving repurchase claims involving certain residential mortgage loans sold directly to them by entities related to legacy Countrywide. As a result of these agreements, as well as adjustments to the representations and warranties liability for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by those agreements, we adjusted our liability for representations and warranties. For additional information regarding these agreements, see Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our current repurchase claims experience with the GSEs is predominantly concentrated in the 2004 through 2008 origination vintages where we believe that our exposure to representations and warranties liability is most significant. Our repurchase claims experience related to loans originated prior to 2004 has not been significant and we believe that the changes made to our operations and underwriting policies have reduced our exposure after 2008. The cumulative repurchase claims for 2007 exceed all other vintages. The volume of loans originated in 2007 was significantly higher than any other vintage which, together with the high delinquency level in this vintage, helps to explain the high level of repurchase claims compared to the other vintages. 52 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Cumulative GSE Repurchase Claims by Vintage (1) Exposure at default (EAD) represents the unpaid principal balance at the time of default or the unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2010. Bank of America and legacy Countrywide sold approximately $1.1 trillion of loans originated from 2004 through 2008 to the GSEs. As of December 31, 2010, slightly less than 10 percent of the loans in these vintages have defaulted or are 180 days or more past due (severely delinquent). At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 55 percent of severely delinquent or defaulted loans. Through December 31, 2010, we have received approximately $21.6 billion in repurchase claims associated with these vintages, representing approximately two percent of the loans sold to the GSEs in these vintages. Including the agreement reached with FNMA on December 31, 2010, we have resolved $18.2 billion of these claims with a net loss experience of approximately 27 percent. The claims resolved and the loss rate do not include $839 million in claims extinguished as a result of the agreement with FHLMC due to the global nature of the agreement and, specifically, the absence of a formal apportionment of the agreement amount between current and future claims. Our collateral loss severity rate on approved repurchases has averaged approximately 45 to 55 percent. Although the level of repurchase claims from the GSEs has been elevated for the last few quarters, the agreements with the GSEs have resulted in a decrease in the total number of outstanding repurchase claims at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Based on the information derived from the historical GSE experience, including the GSE agreements discussed on the previous page, we believe we are 70 percent to 75 percent through the receipt of the GSE repurchase claims that we ultimately expect to receive. Bank of America 2010 53 Table of Contents The table below highlights our experience with the GSEs related to loans originated from 2004 through 2008.

We believe that our remaining exposure to representations and warranties for loans sold directly to the GSEs has been accounted for as a result of these agreements and the associated adjustments to our recorded liability for representations and warranties for other loans sold directly to the GSEs and not covered by the agreements. We believe our predictive repurchase models, utilizing our historical repurchase experience with the GSEs while considering current developments, including the recent agreements, projections of future defaults as well as certain assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters, allows us to reasonably estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs. However, future provisions and possible loss or range of loss associated with representations and warranties made to the GSEs may be impacted if actual results are different from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters. Transactions with Investors Other than Government-sponsored Entities In prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. The loans sold include prime loans, including loans with a loan balance in excess of the conforming loan limit, Alt-A, pay-option, home equity and subprime loans. Many of the loans sold in the form of whole loans were subsequently pooled with other mortgages into private-label securitizations issued or sponsored by the third-party buyer of the whole loans. In some of the private-label securitizations, monolines have insured all or some of the issued bonds or certificates. In connection with these securitizations and whole loan sales, we or our subsidiaries or our legacy companies made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans from or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedy to a whole-loan buyer or securitization trust. As detailed in Table 11, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold loans originated from 2004 through 2008 with a principal balance of $963 billion to investors other than GSEs, of which approximately $478 billion in principal has been paid and $216 billion have defaulted, or are severely delinquent (i.e., 180 days or more past due) and are considered principal at-risk at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had received $13.7 billion of repurchase claims on these 2004-2008 loan vintages, of which $6.0 billion have been resolved and $7.7 billion remain outstanding. Of the $7.7 billion of repurchase claims that remain outstanding, we have reviewed $4.1 billion that we have declined to repurchase. We have recognized losses of $1.7 billion on the resolved repurchase claims, $631 million of which relates to monolines and $1.1 billion of which relates to whole loan and private-label investors, as described in more detail below. As it relates to private investors, including those who have invested in private-label securitizations, a contractual liability to repurchase mortgage loans generally arises only if counterparties prove there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor or all investors in a securitization trust, or that there is a breach of other standards established by the terms of the related sale agreement. We believe that the longer a loan performs, the less likely an underwriting representations and warranties breach would have had a material impact on the loan performance or that a breach even exists. Because the majority of the borrowers in this population would have made a significant amount of payments if they are not yet 180 days or more delinquent, we believe that the principal balance at the greatest risk for repurchase requests in this population of private-label investors is a combination of loans that have already defaulted and those that are currently 180 days or more past due. Additionally, the obligation to repurchase mortgage loans also requires that counterparties have the contractual right to demand repurchase of the loans. Based on a recent court ruling that dismissed a case against legacy Countrywide, we believe private-label securitization investors must generally aggregate 25 percent of the voting interests in each of the tranches of a particular securitization to instruct the securitization trustee to investigate potential repurchase claims. While a securitization trustee may elect to investigate or demand repurchase of loans on its own, individual investors typically have limited rights under the contracts to present repurchase claims directly. Also, the motivation of some private-label securitization investors to assert repurchase claims may be diminished by the fact that their investment is not materially impacted by the losses due to the credit enhancement coverage provided by cash flows from the tranches rated below AAA, for example. Any amounts paid related to repurchase claims from a monoline are paid to the securitization trust and are applied in accordance with the terms of the 54 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents governing securitization documents, which may include use by the securitization trust to repay any outstanding monoline advances or reduce future advances from the monolines. To the extent that a monoline has not advanced funds or does not anticipate that it will be required to advance funds to the securitization trust, the likelihood of receiving a repurchase request from a monoline may be reduced as the monoline would receive limited or no benefit from the payment of repurchase claims. Moreover, some monolines are not currently performing their obligations under the financial guaranty policies they issued which may, in certain circumstances, impact their ability to present repurchase claims. Table 11 details the population of loans sold as whole-loans or in non-agency securitizations by entity and product together with the principal at-risk stratified by the number of payments the borrower made prior to default or becoming severely delinquent.

(2) Excludes transactions sponsored by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch where no representations or warranties were assumed. (3) Includes exposures on third-party sponsored transactions related to legacy entity originations. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 22 percent of the loans sold to non-GSEs that were originated from 2004 to 2008 have defaulted or are severely delinquent. As shown in Table 11, at least 25 payments have been made on approximately 58 percent of the loans included in principal at-risk. We believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other negative economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of the loan default. We believe the agreements for private-label securitizations generally contain less rigorous representations and warranties and generally impose higher burdens on investors seeking loan repurchases than the comparable agreements with the GSEs. For example, borrower fraud representations and warranties were generally not given in private-label securitizations. The following represent some of the typical private-label securitization transaction terms (which differ substantially from those provided in GSE transactions): Representation of material compliance with underwriting guidelines (which often explicitly permit exceptions). Few transactions contain a representation that there has been no fraud or material misrepresentation by a borrower or third party. Many representations include materiality qualifiers. Breach of representation must materially and adversely affect certificate holders interest in the loan. No representation that the mortgage is of investment quality. Offering documents included extensive disclosures, including detailed risk factors, description of underwriting practices and guidelines, and loan attributes. Only parties to a pooling and servicing agreement (e.g., the trustee) can bring repurchase claims. Certificate holders cannot bring claims directly and do not have access to loan files. At least 25 percent of each tranche of certificate holders is generally required in order to direct a trustee to review loan files for potential claims. In addition, certificate holders must bear costs of a trustee loan file review. Repurchase liability is generally limited to the seller. These factors lead us to believe that only a portion of the principal at-risk with respect to loans included in private-label securitizations will be the subject of a repurchase request and only a portion of those requests would ultimately result in a repurchase. Although our experience with non-GSE claims remains limited, we expect additional activity in this area going forward and that the volume of repurchase claims from monolines, whole-loan investors and investors in private-label securitizations could increase in the future. It is reasonably possible that future losses may occur, and our estimate is that the upper range of possible loss related to non-GSE sales could be $7 billion to $10 billion over existing accruals. This estimate does not represent a probable loss, is based on currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. A significant portion of this estimate relates to loans originated through legacy Countrywide, and the repurchase liability is generally limited to the original seller of the loan. Future provisions and possible loss or range of loss may be impacted if actual results are different from our assumptions regarding economic conditions, home prices and other matters and may vary by counterparty. The resolution of the repurchase claims process with the non-GSE counterparties will likely be a protracted process, and we will vigorously contest any request for repurchase if we conclude that a valid basis for the repurchase claim does not exist. The following discussion provides more detailed information related to non-GSE counterparties. Monoline Insurers Legacy companies have sold $185.6 billion of loans originated from 2004 through 2008 into monoline-insured securitizations, which are included in Table 11, including $106.2 billion of first-lien mortgages and $79.4 billion of Bank of America 2010 55 Table of Contents second-lien mortgages. Of these balances, $45.8 billion of the first-lien mortgages and $48.5 billion of the second-lien mortgages have paid off and $32.9 billion of the first-lien mortgages and $14.5 billion of the second-lien mortgages have defaulted or are severely delinquent and are considered principal at-risk at December 31, 2010. At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 52 percent of the loans included in principal at-risk. Of the first-lien mortgages sold, $41.0 billion, or 39 percent, were sold as whole loans to other institutions which subsequently included these loans with those of other originators in private-label securitization transactions in which the monolines typically insured one or more securities. Through December 31, 2010, we have received $5.6 billion of representations and warranties claims related to the monoline-insured transactions. Of these repurchase claims, $799 million have been resolved, with losses of $631 million. The majority of these resolved claims related to second-lien mortgages and $678 million of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification while $121 million were rescinded by the investor or paid in full. At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase requests was $4.8 billion, including $3.0 billion that have been reviewed where it is believed a valid defect has not been identified which would constitute an actionable breach of representations and warranties and $1.8 billion that are in the process of review. We have had limited experience with most of the monoline insurers in the repurchase process, which has constrained our ability to resolve the open claims with such counterparties. Also, certain monoline insurers have instituted litigation against legacy Countrywide and Bank of America, which limits our relationship with such monoline insurers and ability to enter into constructive dialogue to resolve the open claims. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate future repurchase obligations with respect to those monolines with whom we have limited repurchase experience and, therefore, no liability has been recorded in connection with these monolines, other than a liability for repurchase requests that are in the process of review and repurchase requests where we have determined that there are valid loan defects. However, certain other monoline insurers have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that experience to record a liability related to existing and projected future claims from such counterparties. Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations Legacy entities, and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold loans in whole loan sales or via private-label securitizations with a total principal balance of $777.1 billion originated from 2004 through 2008, which are included in Table 11, of which $384.0 billion have been paid off and $169.0 billion have defaulted or are severely delinquent and are considered principal at-risk at December 31, 2010. At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 60 percent of the loans included in principal at-risk. We have received approximately $8.1 billion of representations and warranties claims from whole loan investors and private-label securitization investors related to these vintages, including $5.6 billion from whole loan investors, $800 million from one private-label securitization counterparty which were submitted prior to 2008 and $1.7 billion in recent demands from private-label securitization investors. Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly. The inclusion of the $1.7 billion in recent demands from private-label securitization investors does not mean that we believe these claims have satisfied the contractual thresholds required for these investors to direct the securitization trustee to take action or are otherwise procedurally or substantively valid. Additionally, certain private-label securitizations are insured by the monolines, which are not reflected in these figures regarding whole loan sales and private-label securitizations. We have resolved $5.2 billion of the claims received from whole loan investors and private-label securitization investors with losses of $1.1 billion. Approximately $2.1 billion of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification and $3.1 billion were rescinded by the investor. Claims outstanding related to these vintages totaled $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010, $1.1 billion of which we have reviewed and declined to repurchase based on an assessment of whether a material breach exists, $91 million of which are in the process of review and $1.7 billion of which are demands from private-label securitization investors received in the fourth quarter of 2010. The majority of the claims that we have received so far are from whole loan investors and until we have meaningful repurchase experiences with counterparties other than whole loan investors, it is not possible to determine whether a loss related to our private-label securitizations has occurred or is probable. However, certain whole loan investors have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that experience to record a liability related to existing and future claims from such counterparties. On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP (which changed its name to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, received a letter, in its capacity as servicer on 115 private-label securitizations which was subsequently extended to 225 securitizations. The letter asserted breaches of certain servicing obligations, including an alleged failure to provide notice of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to mortgage loans included in the transactions.

See Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties on page 112 for information related to our estimated liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees related to mortgage-related securitizations.

Regulatory Matters Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on recent or proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as other risks to which we are exposed, including among others, enhanced regulatory scrutiny or potential legal liability as a result of the recent financial crisis. Financial Reform Act On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act enacts sweeping financial regulatory reform and will alter the way in which we conduct certain businesses, increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Background The Financial Reform Act mandates that the Federal Reserve limit debit card interchange fees. Provisions in the legislation also ban banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and restrict their sponsorship of, or investing in, hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to limited exceptions. The Financial Reform Act increases regulation of the derivative markets through measures that broaden the derivative instruments subject to regulation and requires clearing and exchange trading as well as imposing additional capital and margin requirements for derivative market participants. The Financial Reform Act also changes the methodology for calculating deposit insurance assessments from the amount of an insured depository institution domestic deposits to its total assets minus tangible capital; provides for resolution authority to establish a process to unwind large systemically important financial companies; creates a new regulatory body to set requirements regarding the terms and conditions of consumer financial products and expands the role of state regulators in enforcing consumer protection requirements over banks; includes new minimum leverage and risk-based 56 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents capital requirements for large financial institutions; disqualifies trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital; and requires securitizers to retain a portion of the risk that would otherwise be transferred into certain securitization transactions. Many of these provisions have begun to be phased-in or will be phased-in over the next several months or years and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. The Financial Reform Act will continue to have a significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions, as well as reduce available capital. The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on our businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain provisions. For information on the impact of the Financial Reform Act on our credit ratings, see Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67. The Financial Reform Act and other proposed regulatory initiatives may also have an adverse impact on capital. During 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized rules on certain capital and liquidity measurements. For additional information on these rules, see Regulatory Capital Regulatory Capital Changes beginning on page 64. Debit Interchange Fees The limits that the Financial Reform Act places on debit interchange fees will significantly reduce our debit card interchange revenues. Interchange fees, or swipe fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other credit card companies and card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. The legislation, which provides the Federal Reserve with authority over interchange fees received or charged by a card issuer, requires that fees must be reasonable and proportional to the costs of processing such transactions. The Federal Reserve considered the functional similarity between debit card transactions and traditional checking transactions and the incremental costs incurred by a card issuer in processing a particular debit card transaction. In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing. On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule that would establish debit card interchange fee standards and prohibit network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The Federal Reserve requested comments on two alternative interchange fee standards that would apply to all covered issuers: one based on each issuer costs, with a safe harbor initially set at $0.07 per transaction and a cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction; and the other a stand-alone cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction. The Federal Reserve also requested comment on possible frameworks for an adjustment to the interchange fees to reflect certain issuer costs associated with fraud prevention. If the Federal Reserve adopts either of these proposed standards in the final rule, the maximum allowable interchange fee received by covered issuers for debit card transactions would be more than 70 percent lower than the 2009 average once the new rule takes effect on July 21, 2011. The proposed rule would also prohibit issuers and networks from restricting the number of networks over which debit card transactions may be processed. The Federal Reserve requested comment on two alternative approaches: one alternative would require at least two unaffiliated networks per debit card, and the other would require at least two unaffiliated networks per debit card for each type of cardholder authorization method (such as signature or PIN). Under both alternatives, the issuers and networks would be prohibited from inhibiting a merchant ability to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any network that the issuer enabled to process them. As previously announced on July 16, 2010, as a result of the Financial Reform Act and its related rules and subject to final rulemaking over the next year, we believe that our debit card revenue will be adversely impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2011. Our consumer and small business card products, including the debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within the Global Card Services business segment. In 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to the debit card interchange fee standards to be adopted under the Financial Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually based on 2010 volumes. As a result, we recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge for Global Card Services of $10.4 billion in 2010. We have identified other potential mitigation actions within Global Card Services , but they are in the early stages of development and some of them may impact other segments. The impairment charge, which is a non-cash item, had no impact on our reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. If the Federal Reserve sets the final interchange fee standards at the lowest proposed fee alternative, as described above (i.e., $0.07 per transaction) the lower interchange revenue may result in additional impairment of goodwill in Global Card Services. In view of the uncertainty with model inputs including the final ruling, changes in the economic outlook and the corresponding impact to revenues and asset quality, and the impacts of mitigation actions, it is not possible to estimate the amount or range of amounts of additional goodwill impairment, if any, associated with changes to interchange fee standards. For more information on goodwill and the impairment charge, refer to Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex Accounting Estimates beginning on page 107. Limitations on Certain Activities We anticipate that the final regulations associated with the Financial Reform Act will include limitations on certain activities, including limitations on the use of a bank own capital for proprietary trading and sponsorship or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (Volcker Rule). Regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are required to be in place by October 21, 2011, and the Volcker Rule becomes effective twelve months after such rules are final or on July 21, 2012, whichever is earlier. The Volcker Rule then gives banking entities two years from the effective date (with opportunities for additional extensions) to bring activities and investments into conformance. In anticipation of the adoption of the final regulations, we have begun winding down our proprietary trading line of business. The ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule or the winding down of this business, and the time it will take to comply or complete, continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations issued may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us. Derivatives The Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives, imposing new capital and margin requirements for certain market participants and imposing position limits on certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings by these agencies. Generally, the CFTC and SEC have until July 16, 2011 to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to implement these regulations. The ultimate impact of these derivatives regulations, and the time it will take to comply, continues to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments Since the financial crisis began several years ago, an increasing number of bank failures has imposed significant costs on the FDIC in resolving those failures, and the regulator deposit insurance fund has been depleted. In order to Bank of America 2010 57 Table of Contents maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased, and may increase in the future, assessment rates of insured institutions, including Bank of America. Deposits placed at the U.S. Banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to $250,000 per customer. The Financial Reform Act also provides for unlimited FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts for a two-year period beginning on December 31, 2010 and ending on January 1, 2013. The FDIC administers the Deposit Insurance Fund, and all insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC that fund the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Financial Reform Act changed the methodology for calculating deposit insurance assessments from the amount of an insured depository institution domestic deposits to its total assets minus tangible capital. On February 7, 2011 the FDIC issued a new regulation implementing revisions to the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act. The new regulation will be effective April 1, 2011 and will be reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the invoices for assessments due September 30, 2011. As a result of the new regulations, we expect to incur higher annual deposit insurance assessments. We have identified potential mitigation actions, but they are in the early stages of development and we are not able to directly control the basis or the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance or for other fees or assessment obligations imposed on financial institutions. Any future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. CARD Act On May 22, 2009, the CARD Act was signed into law. The majority of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February 2010. The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit card reform related to credit card industry practices including significantly restricting banks ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. The provisions of the CARD Act negatively impacted net interest income and card income during 2010, and are expected to negatively impact future net interest income due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue was approximately $1.5 billion. Regulation E On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments to Regulation E which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. The rules became effective on July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for existing customers. These amendments limit the way we and other banks charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer account unless the consumer affirmatively consents to the bank payment of overdrafts for those transactions. Under previously announced plans, we do not offer customers the opportunity to opt-in to overdraft services related to non-recurring debit card transactions. However, customers are able to opt-in on a withdrawal-by-withdrawal basis to access cash through the Bank of America ATM network where the bank is able to alert customers that the transaction may overdraw their account and result in a fee if they choose to proceed. The impact of Regulation E, which was in effect beginning in the third quarter and fully in effect in the fourth quarter of 2010, and our overdraft policy changes, which were in effect for the full year of 2010, was a reduction in service charges during 2010 of approximately $1.7 billion. In 2011, the incremental reduction to service charges related to Regulation E and overdraft policy changes is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, or a full-year impact of approximately $2.8 billion, net of identified mitigation action. U.K. Corporate Income Tax Rate On July 27, 2010, the U.K. government enacted a law change reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1, 2011. While this rate reduction favorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, it also required us to remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rate, which resulted in a charge to income tax expense of $392 million in 2010. A future rate reduction of one percent per year is generally expected to be enacted in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013, which would result in a similar charge to income tax expense of nearly $400 million during each of the three years. The U.K. Treasury has asked for taxpayer views on whether the U.K. government should alternatively enact the full remaining three-percent reduction entirely during 2011, which would accelerate the possible charges into 2011 for a total of approximately $1.1 billion. Final Regulatory Guidance on Consolidation On January 21, 2010, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC and Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively, joint agencies) issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital requirements related to the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance. The impact on the Corporation on January 1, 2010 due to the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was an increase in risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of $9.7 billion. The overall impact of the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps. For more information, see Balance Sheet Overview Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance on page 29, Capital Management beginning on page 63 and Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67. Payment Protection Insurance In the U.K., the Corporation sells PPI through its Global Card Services business to credit card customers and has previously sold this insurance to consumer loan customers. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints of misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) has investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints relating to the sale of these insurance policies. In August 2010, the FSA issued a policy statement on the assessment and remediation of PPI claims which is applicable to the Corporation U.K. consumer businesses and is intended to address concerns among consumers and regulators regarding the handling of PPI complaints across the industry. The policy statement sets standards for the sale of PPI that apply to current and prior sales, and in the event a company does not or did not comply with the standards, it is alleged that the insurance was incorrectly sold, giving the customer rights to remedies. Given the new regulatory guidance, in 2010, the Corporation had a liability of $630 million based on its current claims history and an estimate of future claims that have yet to be asserted against the Corporation. For additional information on PPI, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements Payment Protection Insurance Claims Matter on page 196. U.K. Bank Levy On June 22, 2010, the U.K. government announced that it intended to introduce an annual bank levy. Beginning in 2011, the bank levy will be payable on the consolidated liabilities, subject to certain exclusions and offsets, of U.K. group companies and U.K. branches of foreign banking groups as of each year-end balance sheet date. As currently proposed, the bank levy rate for 2011 and 58 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents future years will be 0.075 percent per annum for certain short-term liabilities with a rate of 0.0375 percent per annum for longer maturity liabilities and certain deposits. The legislation is expected to be enacted in the third quarter of 2011. We currently estimate that the cost of the U.K. bank levy will be approximately $125 million annually beginning in 2011. Regulatory Guidance on Collateral Dependent Loans On February 23, 2010, regulators issued clarifying guidance, effective in the first quarter of 2010, on modified consumer real estate loans that specifies criteria required to demonstrate a borrower capacity to repay the modified loan. In connection with this guidance, we reviewed our modified consumer real estate loans and determined that a portion of these loans did not meet the criteria and, therefore, were deemed collateral dependent. The guidance requires that a modified loan deemed to be collateral dependent be written down to its estimated collateral value even if that loan is performing. The application of this guidance resulted in $1.0 billion of net charge-offs in 2010, of which $822 million were home equity, $207 million were residential mortgage and $9 million were discontinued real estate. Making Home Affordable Program On March 4, 2009, the U.S. Treasury provided details related to the $75 billion Making Home Affordable program (MHA) which is focused on reducing the number of foreclosures and making it easier for customers to refinance loans. The MHA consists of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which provides guidelines on first-lien loan modifications, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which provides guidelines for loan refinancing. As part of the MHA program, on April 28, 2009, the U.S. government announced intentions to create the second-lien modification program (2MP) that is designed to reduce the monthly payments on qualifying home equity loans and lines of credit under certain conditions, including completion of a HAMP modification on the first mortgage on the property. This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. Additional clarification on government guidelines for the program was announced early in 2010. On April 8, 2010, we began early implementation of the 2MP with the mailing of trial modification offers to eligible home equity customers. We will modify eligible second liens under this initiative regardless of whether the MHA modified first lien is serviced by the Corporation or another participating servicer. On April 5, 2010, we implemented the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program, which is another addition to the HAMP that assists borrowers with non-retention options, such as short sale or deed-in-lieu options, instead of foreclosure. The HAFA program provides incentives to lenders to assist all eligible borrowers that fall under the guidelines of this program. Our first goal is to work with the borrower to determine if a loan modification or other homeownership retention solution is available before pursuing non-retention options such as short sales. Short sales are an important option for homeowners who are facing financial difficulty and do not have a viable option to remain in the home. HAFA short sale guidelines are designed to streamline and standardize the process and will be compatible with Bank of America new cooperative short sale program. During 2010, 285,000 loan modifications were completed with a total unpaid principal balance of $65.7 billion, including 109,000 loans with a total unpaid principal amount of $25.5 billion that were converted from trial-period to permanent modifications under the MHA, which include HAMP first-lien modifications and 2MP second-lien modifications. In addition, on March 26, 2010, the U.S. government announced new changes to the MHA program guidelines that include principal forgiveness options to the HAMP for a sub-segment of qualified HAMP borrowers. The details around eligibility, forgiveness arrangements and the incentive structures are still being finalized. However, we implemented a forgiveness program on a subset of HAMP eligible products under the National Home Retention Program (NHRP) in 2010. In addition to the programs described above, we have implemented several programs designed to help our customers. For information on these programs, refer to Credit Risk Management beginning on page 71. We will continue to help our customers address financial challenges through these government programs and our own home retention programs. Stress Tests The Corporation has established management routines to periodically conduct stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the Corporation under hypothetical economic scenarios. These stress tests will facilitate our contingency planning and management of capital and liquidity. These processes were also used to conduct the recent secondary stress testing imposed by the Federal Reserve and were incorporated into the Capital Plan that was submitted as part of this request, which included a proposed modest increase in our common dividend in the second half of 2011. The results of these stress tests may influence bank regulatory supervisory requirements concerning the Corporation and may impact the amount or timing of dividends or distributions to the Corporation stockholders. For additional information, see Capital Management beginning on page 63 and Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67. Other Matters The Corporation has established guidelines and policies for managing capital across its subsidiaries. The guidance for the Corporation subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements, including branch operations of banking subsidiaries, requires each entity to maintain satisfactory capital levels. This includes setting internal capital targets for the U.S. bank subsidiaries to exceed well capitalized levels. The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans (commonly referred to as living wills) by such entities. We are currently monitoring the impact of these initiatives. Managing Risk Overview Risk is inherent in every activity that we undertake. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risk. We must manage these risks to maximize our long-term results by ensuring the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. Strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution, and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower or counterparty inability to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. Liquidity risk is the inability to meet contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Compliance risk is the risk that arises from the failure to adhere to laws, rules, regulations, or internal policies and procedures. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. Reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding an organization conduct or business practices will adversely affect its profitability, operations or customer base, or require costly Bank of America 2010 59 Table of Contents litigation or other measures. Reputational risk is evaluated within all of the risk categories and throughout the risk management process, and as such is not discussed separately herein. The following sections, Strategic Risk Management beginning on page 62, Capital Management beginning on page 63, Liquidity Risk beginning on page 67, Credit Risk Management beginning on page 71, Market Risk Management beginning on page 100, Compliance Risk Management on page 106 and Operational Risk Management beginning on page 106, address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage. In choosing when and how to take risks, we evaluate our capacity for risk and seek to protect our brand and reputation, our financial flexibility, the value of our assets and the strategic potential of our Corporation. We intend to maintain a strong and flexible financial position that will allow us to successfully weather challenging economic times and take advantage of opportunities to grow. We also intend to focus on maintaining our relevance and value to customers, associates and shareholders. To achieve these objectives, we have built a comprehensive risk management culture and have implemented governance and control measures to maintain that culture. Our risk management infrastructure is continually evolving to meet the heightened challenges posed by the increased complexity of the financial services industry and markets, by our increased size and global footprint, and by the financial crisis. We have a defined risk framework and clearly articulated risk appetite which is approved annually by the Corporation Board of Directors (the Board). We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risk management planning is fully integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole as well as managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions, and across all geographic locations. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by executive management and the Board. Executive management assesses, and the Board oversees, the risk-adjusted returns of each business segment through review and approval of strategic and financial operating plans. By allocating economic capital to and establishing a risk appetite for a business segment, we seek to effectively manage the ability to take on risk. Economic capital is assigned to each business segment using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment stand-alone credit, market, interest rate and operational risk components, and is used to measure risk-adjusted returns. Businesses operate within their credit, market, compliance and operational risk standards and limits in order to adhere to the risk appetite. These limits are based on analyses of risk and reward in each line of business, and executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board monitors financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite and the adequacy of internal controls through its committees. On December 14, 2010, the Board completed its annual review and approval of the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Statement for the Corporation. The Risk Framework defines the accountability of the Corporation and its associates and the Risk Appetite Statement defines the parameters under which we will take risk. Both documents are intended to enable us to maximize our long-term results and ensure the integrity of our assets and the quality of our earnings. The Risk Framework is designed to be used by our associates to understand risk management activities, including their individual roles and accountabilities. It also defines how risk management is integrated into our core business processes, and it defines the risk management governance structure, including management involvement. The risk management responsibilities of the lines of business, governance and control functions, and Corporate Audit are also clearly defined, and reflects how the Board-approved risk appetite influences business and risk strategy. The risk management process contains four elements: identify and measure risk, mitigate and control risk, monitor and test risk, and report and review risk, and is applied across all business activities to enable an integrated and comprehensive review of risk consistent with the Board Risk Appetite Statement. Risk Management Processes and Methods To support our corporate goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies, we maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by management and the Board. All associates have accountability for risk management. Each associate risk management responsibilities falls into one of three major categories: lines of business, governance and control (Global Risk Management and enterprise control functions) and Corporate Audit. Line of business managers and associates are accountable for identifying, managing and escalating attention, as appropriate, to all risks in their business units, including existing and emerging risks. Line of business managers must ensure that their business activities are conducted within the risk appetite defined by management and approved by the Board. The limits and controls for each business must be consistent with the Risk Appetite Statement. Line of business associates in client and customer facing businesses are responsible for day-to-day business activities, including developing and delivering profitable products and services, fulfilling customer requests and maintaining desirable customer relationships. These associates are accountable for conducting their daily work in accordance with policies and procedures. It is the responsibility of each associate to protect the Corporation and defend the interests of the shareholders. Governance and control functions are comprised of Global Risk Management and the enterprise control functions. Global Risk Management is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO leads senior management in managing risk, is independent from the Corporation lines of business and enterprise control functions, and maintains sufficient autonomy to develop and implement meaningful risk management measures. This position serves to protect the Corporation and its shareholders. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and is the management team lead or a participant in Board-level risk governance committees. The CRO has the mandate to ensure that appropriate risk management practices are in place, effective and consistent with our overall business strategy and risk appetite. Global Risk Management is comprised of two types of risk teams, Enterprise Risk Teams and independent line of business risk teams, which report to the CRO and are independent from the lines of business and enterprise control functions. Enterprise Risk Teams are responsible for setting and establishing enterprise policies, programs and standards, assessing program adherence, providing enterprise-level risk oversight, and reporting and monitoring for systemic and emerging risk issues. In addition, the Enterprise Risk Teams are responsible for monitoring and ensuring that risk limits are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. These risk teams also carry out risk-based oversight of the enterprise control functions. Independent line of business risk teams are responsible for establishing policies, limits, standards, controls, metrics and thresholds within the defined corporate standards for the lines of business to which they are aligned. The independent line of business risk teams are responsible for ensuring that risk limits and standards are reasonable and consistent with the risk appetite. Enterprise control functions are independent of the lines of business and have risk governance and control responsibilities for enterprise programs. In this role, they are responsible for setting policies, standards and limits; providing risk reporting; monitoring for systemic risk issues including existing, emerging and reputational; and implementing procedures and controls at the enterprise and line of business levels for their respective control functions. Enterprise control functions consist of the Chief Financial Officer group, Global 60 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Technology and Operations, Global Human Resources, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs, and Legal. The Corporate Audit function and the Corporate General Auditor maintain independence from the lines of business and governance and control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee of the Board. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment of the Corporation management and internal control systems. Corporate Audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected; significant financial, managerial and operating information is materially complete, accurate and reliable; and employees actions are in compliance with the Corporation policies, standards, procedures, and applicable laws and regulations. To ensure that the Corporation goals and objectives, risk appetite, and business and risk strategies are achieved, we utilize a risk management process that is applied across the execution of all business activities. This risk management process, which is an integral part of our Risk Framework, enables the Corporation to review risk in an integrated and comprehensive manner across all risk categories and make strategic and business decisions based on that comprehensive view. Corporate goals and objectives and our risk appetite are established by management, approved by the Board, and are key drivers to setting business and risk strategy. One of the key tools of the risk management process is the use of Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs). RCSAs are the primary method for facilitating the management of Business Environment and Internal Control Factor (BEICF) data. The end-to-end RCSA process incorporates risk identification and assessment of the control environment; monitoring, reporting and escalating risk; quality assurance and data validation; and integration with the risk appetite. The RCSA process also incorporates documentation by either the line of business or enterprise control function of the business environment, risks, controls, and monitoring and reporting. This results in a comprehensive risk management view that enables understanding of and action on operational risks and controls for all of our processes, products, activities and systems. The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our associates are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Ethics, we set a high standard for our associates. The Code of Ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of our products or services to our customers. We instill a strong and comprehensive risk management culture through communications, training, policies, procedures, and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the associate performance management process and individual compensation to encourage associates to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals. Board Oversight of Risk We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by management and the Board. The majority of our directors, including the Chairman of the Board, are considered independent and meet the requirements of our Director Independence Categorical Standards and the criteria for independence in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Also, all members of the Audit and Enterprise Risk Committees are independent and all members of the Credit Committee are non-management directors. The Board is responsible for the oversight of the management of the Corporation. As part of its oversight, the Board oversees the management of the various types of risk faced by the Corporation. Our corporate risk management governance structure is designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of our stockholders and to foster integrity throughout the Corporation. The Board, under the leadership of its independent Chairman, oversees the management of the Corporation through the governance structure, which includes Board committees and management committees. The Board maintains standing committees to oversee risk. The committees with the majority of risk oversight responsibilities include the Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees. Bank of America 2010 61 Table of Contents The figure below illustrates the inter-relationship between the Board, Board level committees and management level committees with the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation. (1) Compliance Risk activities, including Ethics Oversight, are required to be reviewed by the Audit Committee and Operational Risk activities are required to be reviewed by the Enterprise Risk Committee. (2) The Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in fulfilling their responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of the Corporation disclosures and reports the results of the process to the Audit Committee. The Credit Committee is responsible for oversight of senior management identification and management of the Corporation credit exposures on an enterprise-wide basis, as well as the Corporation responses to trends affecting those exposures. The Credit Committee is also responsible for oversight of senior management actions relating to the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and the Corporation credit-related policies. The Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for exercising oversight of senior management responsibility to identify the material risks facing the Corporation and oversight of senior management planning for and management of the Corporation material risks, including market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. The Enterprise Risk Committee also oversees senior management establishment of policies and guidelines articulating the Corporation risk tolerances for material categories of risk, the performance and functioning of the Corporation overall risk management function, and senior management establishment of appropriate systems that support control of market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing the integrity of the Corporation Consolidated Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the Corporation system of internal controls and policies and procedures for managing and assessing risk, including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee also provides approval and direct oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm, including such firm assessment of management assertion of the effectiveness of the Corporation disclosure controls and procedures and the Corporation internal control over financial reporting; and oversight of such accountant appointment, compensation, qualifications and independence. The Audit Committee also oversees the corporate audit function. The Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees provide enterprise-wide oversight of the Corporation management and handling of risk. Each of these three committees reports regularly to the Board on risk-related matters within its responsibilities and together they provide the Board with integrated, thorough insight about our management of strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, legal, operational and reputational risks. At meetings of each Board committee and our Board, directors receive updates from management regarding all aspects of enterprise risk management, including our performance against our identified risk appetite. Executive management develops for Board approval the Corporation Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement, and strategic and financial operating plans. Management and the Board, through the Credit, Enterprise Risk and Audit Committees, monitor financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, compliance with the risk appetite, and the adequacy of internal controls. Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every line of business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, 62 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is high due to changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered in the context of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the Chief Executive Officer and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions, are reviewed and approved by the Board. Executive management and the Board approve a strategic plan every two to three years. Annually, executive management develops a financial operating plan and the Board reviews and approves the plan. With oversight by the Board, executive management ensures that the plans are consistent with the Corporation strategic plan, core operating tenets and risk appetite. The following are assessed in their reviews: forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. With oversight by the Board, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and defines changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize between achieving the targeted risk appetite and shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. We use proprietary models to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The economic capital assigned to each line of business is based on its unique risk exposures. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use economic capital to define business strategies, price products and transactions, and evaluate client profitability. Capital Management Bank of America manages its capital position to maintain a strong and flexible financial position in order to perform through economic cycles, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, remain a source of financial strength for its subsidiaries, and return capital to its shareholders as appropriate. To determine the appropriate level of capital, we assess the results of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), the current economic and market environment, and feedback from investors, ratings agencies and regulators. Based upon this analysis we set capital guidelines for Tier 1 common capital and Tier 1 capital to ensure we can maintain an adequate capital position in a severe adverse economic scenario. We also target to maintain capital in excess of the capital required per our economic capital measurement process (see Economic Capital on page 66). Management and the Board annually approve a comprehensive Capital Plan which documents the ICAAP and related results, analysis and support for the capital guidelines, and planned capital actions and capital adequacy assessment. The ICAAP incorporates capital forecasts, stress test results, economic capital, qualitative risk assessments and assessment of regulatory changes. We generate monthly regulatory capital and economic capital forecasts that are aligned to the most recent earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts. We utilize quarterly stress tests to assess the potential impacts to earnings, capital and liquidity for a variety of economic stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in the forecasts, stress tests or economic capital. Given the significant proposed regulatory capital changes, we also regularly assess the potential capital impacts and monitor associated mitigation actions. Management continuously assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the capital guidelines and capital position to the Board. Capital management is integrated into the risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in development of the strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit and used to perform risk-adjusted return analysis at the business unit, client relationship and transaction level. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines (Basel I) issued by the Federal Reserve. At December 31, 2010, we operated banking activities primarily under two charters: Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. which are subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Under these guidelines, the Corporation and its affiliated banking entities measure capital adequacy based on Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital). Capital ratios are calculated by dividing each capital amount by risk-weighted assets. Additionally, Tier 1 capital is divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets to derive the Tier 1 leverage ratio. Tier 1 capital is calculated as the sum of core capital elements. The predominate components of core capital elements are qualifying common stockholders equity, any CES and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Also included in Tier 1 capital are qualifying trust preferred capital debt securities (Trust Securities), hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries which are subject to the rules governing restricted core capital elements. Goodwill, other disallowed intangible assets, disallowed deferred tax assets and the cumulative changes in fair value of all financial liabilities accounted for under a fair value option that are included in retained earnings and are attributable to changes in the company own creditworthiness are deducted from the sum of the core capital elements. Total capital is Tier 1 plus supplementary Tier 2 capital elements such as qualifying subordinated debt, a limited portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a portion of net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities. Tier 1 common capital is not an official regulatory ratio, but was introduced by the Federal Reserve during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009. Tier 1 common capital is Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, Trust Securities, hybrid securities and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Risk-weighted assets are calculated for credit risk for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures and for market risk on trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Credit risk risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning a prescribed risk-weight to all on-balance sheet assets and to the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight is defined in the regulatory rules based upon the obligor or guarantor type and collateral if applicable. Off-balance sheet exposures include financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives. Market risk risk-weighted assets are calculated using risk models for the trading account positions, including all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of the applicable accounting guidance. Under Basel I there are no risk-weighted assets calculated for operational risk. Any assets that are a direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets consistent with regulatory guidance. For additional information on these and other regulatory requirements, see Note 18 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Composition and Ratios On January 21, 2010, the joint agencies issued a final rule regarding the impact of the new consolidation guidance on risk-based capital. The incremental impact on January 1, 2010 was an increase in assets of $100.4 billion and risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in Tier 1 common Bank of America 2010 63 Table of Contents capital and Tier 1 capital of $9.7 billion. The overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common capital ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps on January 1, 2010. We continued to strengthen capital in 2010 as evidenced by the $4.7 billion growth in Tier 1 common capital or $14.4 billion before the impact of the new consolidation guidance. The increase was driven by the $10.2 billion in earnings generated in 2010, excluding the goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion. Tier 1 capital and Total capital grew by $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion in 2010 or by $13.0 billion and $12.9 billion when adjusted for the impact of the new consolidation guidance. Risk-weighted assets declined by $87 billion in 2010 including the impact of the new consolidation guidance. The risk-weighted asset reduction is consistent with our continued efforts to reduce non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios. As a result of the increased capital position and reduced risk-weighted assets, the Tier 1 common capital ratio increased 79 bps to 8.60 percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio increased 84 bps to 11.24 percent and Total capital increased 111 bps to 15.77 percent in 2010. When adjusted for the impacts of the new consolidation guidance, the growth in the ratios was more significant. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 33 bps to 7.21 percent, reflecting both the strengthening of the capital position previously mentioned and a $62 billion reduction in adjusted quarterly average total assets including the impact of the new consolidation guidance. The $12.4 billion goodwill impairment charges recognized during 2010 did not impact the regulatory capital ratios. The table below presents the Corporation capital ratios and related information at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Table 12 Regulatory Capital December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2010 2009 Tier 1 common equity ratio 8.60 % 7.81 % Tier 1 capital ratio 11.24 10.40 Total capital ratio 15.77 14.66 Tier 1 leverage ratio 7.21 6.88 Risk-weighted assets $ 1,456 $ 1,543 Adjusted quarterly average total assets (1) 2,270 2,332 (1) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Regulatory Capital Changes In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, we also manage regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy. The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II) which was published in December 2007 established requirements for U.S. implementation of the Basel Committee Basel II Accord and provides detailed requirements for a new regulatory capital framework. This regulatory capital framework includes requirements related to credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). We began the Basel II parallel qualification period on April 1, 2010. Designated U.S. financial institutions are required to complete a minimum parallel qualification period under Basel II of four consecutive successful quarters before receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using the Basel II methodology and exiting the parallel period. During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations under both the current risk-based capital rules (Basel I) and Basel II will be reported to the financial institutions regulatory supervisors. Once the parallel period is successfully completed and we have received approval to exit parallel, we will transition to Basel II as the methodology for calculating regulatory capital. Basel II provides for a three-year transitional floor subsequent to exiting parallel, after which Basel I may be discontinued. The Collins Amendment within the Financial 64 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Reform Act and the U.S. banking regulators subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published by the Federal Reserve on December 14, 2010 propose however that the current three-year transitional floors under Basel II be replaced with a permanent risk based capital floor as defined under Basel I. On December 16, 2010, U.S. regulators issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines for Market Risk (Market Risk Rules), reflecting partial adoption of the Basel Committee July 2009 consultative document on the topic. We anticipate U.S. regulators will adopt the Market Risk Rules in mid-2011. This change is expected to significantly increase the capital requirements for our trading assets and liabilities, including derivatives exposures which meet the definition established by the regulatory agencies. We continue to evaluate the capital impact of the proposed rules and currently anticipate being fully compliant with any final rules by the projected implementation date of year-end 2011. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems (Basel III), proposing a January 2013 implementation date for Basel III. If implemented by U.S. regulators as proposed, Basel III could significantly increase our capital requirements. Basel III and the Financial Reform Act propose the disqualification of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, with the Financial Reform Act proposing the disqualification be phased in from 2013 to 2015. Basel III also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital (deferred tax assets, MSRs, investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations), the inclusion of other comprehensive income in capital, increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. The phase-in period for the capital deductions is proposed to occur in 20 percent increments from 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by December 31, 2018. The increase in capital requirements for counterparty credit risk is proposed to be effective January 2013. The phase-in period for the new minimum capital requirements and related buffers is proposed to occur between 2013 and 2019. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the final rulemaking processes for Basel III in early 2011 and have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by year-end 2011 or early 2012. For additional information on our MSRs, refer to Note 25 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on deferred tax assets, refer to Note 21 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If Basel III is implemented in the U.S. consistent with Basel Committee rules, beginning in January 2013, we would be required to maintain minimum capital ratio requirements of 6.0 percent for Tier 1 capital and 8.0 percent for Total capital. Basel III also includes a proposed minimum requirement for common equity Tier 1 capital of 3.5 percent beginning in 2013 which would increase to 4.5 percent in 2015. Basel III also includes three capital buffers which would be phased in over time and impact all three capital ratios. These buffers include a capital conservation buffer that would start at 0.63 percent in 2016 and increase to 2.5 percent in 2019. Thus, the minimum capital ratio requirements including the capital conservation buffer in 2019 would be 7.0 percent for common equity Tier 1 capital, 8.5 percent for Tier 1 capital and 10.5 percent for Total capital. If ratios fall below the minimum requirement plus the capital conservation buffer, such as 10.5 percent for Total capital, an institution would be required to restrict dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses. Additionally, Basel III also includes a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent that regulators could require in periods of excess credit growth. The countercyclical buffer is to be comprised of loss-absorbing capital, such as common equity, and is meant to retain additional capital during periods of excess credit growth providing incremental protection in the event of a material market downturn. The ratios presented above do not include the third buffer requirement for systemically important financial institutions, which the Basel Committee continues to assess and has not yet quantified. The countercyclical and systemic buffers are scheduled to be phased in from 2013 through 2019. U.S. regulators are expected to begin the rulemaking processes for Basel III in early 2011 and have indicated a goal to adopt final rules by the end of 2011 or early 2012. These regulatory changes also require approval by the agencies of analytical models used as part of our capital measurement and assessment, especially in the case of more complex models. If these more complex models are not approved, it could require financial institutions to hold additional capital, which in some cases could be significant. We expect to maintain a Tier 1 common capital ratio in excess of eight percent as the regulatory rule changes are implemented without needing to raise new equity capital. We have made the implementation and mitigation of these regulatory changes a strategic priority. We also note there remains significant uncertainty on the final impacts as the U.S. has issued final rules only for Basel II and a Notice of Proposal Rulemaking for the Market Risk Rules at this time. Impacts may change as the U.S. finalizes rules and the regulatory agencies interpret the final rules for Basel III during the implementation process. Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. Regulatory Capital The table below presents regulatory capital information for Bank of America N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2010 did not impact the regulatory capital ratios. Table 14 Bank of America, N.A. and FIA Card Services, N.A. Regulatory Capital December 31 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Tier 1 Bank of America, N.A. 10.78 % $ 114,345 10.30 % $ 111,916 FIA Card Services, N.A. 15.30 25,589 15.21 28,831 Total Bank of America, N.A. 14.26 151,255 13.76 149,528 FIA Card Services, N.A. 16.94 28,343 17.01 32,244 Tier 1 leverage Bank of America, N.A. 7.83 114,345 7.38 111,916 FIA Card Services, N.A. 13.21 25,589 23.09 28,831 The Bank of America, N.A. Tier 1 and Total capital ratio increased 48 bps to 10.78 percent and 50 bps to 14.26 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The increase in the ratios was driven by $11.1 billion in earnings generated in 2010 combined with a $26.4 billion decline in risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 45 bps to 7.83 percent benefiting from the improvement in Tier 1 capital combined with a $56.0 billion Bank of America 2010 65 Table of Contents decrease in adjusted quarterly average total assets. The reduction in risk-weighted assets and adjusted quarterly average total assets is consistent with our continued efforts to reduce non-core assets and legacy loan portfolios. The FIA Card Services, N.A. Tier 1 capital ratio increased 9 bps to 15.30 percent and Total capital ratio decreased 7 bps to 16.94 percent compared to December 31, 2009. The increase in Tier 1 capital ratio was due to a decrease in risk-weighted assets of $22.3 billion. The decrease in the Total capital ratio was due to a reduction in Tier 2 capital resulting from a $390 million decrease in qualifying term subordinated debt combined with a net increase in the allowance for credit losses limitation of $269 million. The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 13.21 percent at December 31, 2010 from 23.09 percent at December 31, 2009 due to a $68.9 billion increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets. The increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets was the result of the adoption of new consolidation guidance. Broker/Dealer Regulatory Capital Bank of America principal U.S. broker/dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2010, MLPF&S regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $9.8 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $736 million by $9.1 billion. MLPCC net capital of $2.3 billion exceeded the minimum requirement by $2.1 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. At December 31, 2010, MLPF&S had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. Economic Capital Our economic capital measurement process provides a risk-based measurement of the capital required for unexpected credit, market and operational losses over a one-year time horizon at a 99.97 percent confidence level, consistent with a AA credit rating. Economic capital is allocated to each business unit based upon its risk positions and contribution to enterprise risk, and is used for capital adequacy, performance measurement and risk management purposes. The strategic planning process utilizes economic capital with the goal of allocating risk appropriately and measuring returns consistently across all businesses and activities. Credit Risk Capital Economic capital for credit risk captures two types of risks: default risk, which represents the loss of principal due to outright default or the borrower inability to repay an obligation in full, and migration risk, which represents potential loss in market value due to credit deterioration over the one-year capital time horizon. Credit risk is assessed and modeled for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures within sub-categories for commercial, retail, counterparty and investment securities. The economic capital methodology captures dimensions such as concentration and country risk and originated securitizations. The economic capital methodology is based on the probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and maturity for each credit exposure, and the portfolio correlations across exposures. See page 71 for more information on Credit Risk Management. Market Risk Capital Market risk reflects the potential loss in the value of financial instruments or portfolios due to movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, credit spreads, and security and commodity prices. Bank of America primary market risk exposures are in its trading portfolio, equity investments, MSRs and the interest rate exposure of its core balance sheet. Economic capital is determined by utilizing the same models the Corporation used to manage these risks including, for example, Value-at-Risk, simulation, stress testing and scenario analysis. See page 100 for additional information on Market Risk Management. Operational Risk Capital We calculate operational risk capital at the business unit level using actuarial-based models and historical loss data. We supplement the calculations with scenario analysis and risk control assessments. See Operational Risk Management beginning on page 106 for more information. Capital Actions The Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders on February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 10.0 billion to 11.3 billion. On February 24, 2010, approximately 1.3 billion shares of common stock were issued through the conversion of CES into common stock. For more information regarding this conversion, see Preferred Stock Issuances and Exchanges on page 67. In January 2009, we issued approximately 1.4 billion shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. For additional information regarding the Merrill Lynch acquisition, see Note 2 Merger and Restructuring Activity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2009, we issued warrants to purchase approximately 199.1 million shares of common stock in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. government. For more information, see Preferred Stock Issuances and Exchanges on page 67. In 2009, we issued 1.3 billion shares of common stock at an average price of $10.77 per share through an at-the-market issuance program resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $13.5 billion. In addition, during 2010 and 2009, we issued approximately 98.6 million and 7.4 million shares under employee stock plans. Troubled Asset Relief Program Related Asset Sales We received notification from the Federal Reserve confirming that we fulfilled our commitment to increase equity by $3.0 billion through asset sales to be completed by December 31, 2010. The commitment was made in connection with the approval we received in December 2009 to repurchase the preferred stock that we issued as a result of our participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). There were no common shares repurchased in 2010 except for shares acquired under equity incentive plans, as discussed in Item 5. Market for Registrant Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K. Currently, there is no existing Board authorized share repurchase program. For more information regarding our common share issuances, see Note 15 Shareholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently intend to modestly increase the common stock dividends in the second half of 2011 subject to approval by the Federal Reserve. 66 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Common Stock Dividends The table below is a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during 2010 and through February 25, 2011. Table 15 Common Stock Cash Dividend Summary Dividend Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Per Share January 26, 2011 March 4, 2011 March 25, 2011 $ 0.01 October 25, 2010 December 3, 2010 December 24, 2010 0.01 July 28, 2010 September 3, 2010 September 24, 2010 0.01 April 28, 2010 June 4, 2010 June 25, 2010 0.01 January 27, 2010 March 5, 2010 March 26, 2010 0.01 Preferred Stock Issuances and Exchanges In 2009, we completed an offer to exchange outstanding depositary shares of portions of certain series of preferred stock up to approximately 200 million shares of common stock at an average price of $12.70 per share. In addition, we also entered into agreements with certain holders of other non-government perpetual preferred shares to exchange their holdings of approximately $10.9 billion aggregate liquidation preference of perpetual preferred stock into approximately 800 million shares of common stock. In total, the exchange offer and these privately negotiated exchanges covered the exchange of $14.8 billion aggregate liquidation preference of perpetual preferred stock into 1.0 billion shares of common stock. In 2009, we recorded an increase to retained earnings and net income applicable to common shareholders of $576 million related to these exchanges. This represents the net of a $2.6 billion benefit due to the excess of the carrying value of our non-convertible preferred stock over the fair value of the common stock exchanged. This was partially offset by a $2.0 billion inducement to convertible preferred shareholders representing the excess of the fair value of the common stock exchanged, which was accounted for as an induced conversion of convertible preferred stock, over the fair value of the common stock that would have been issued under the original conversion terms. On December 2, 2009, we received approval from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve to repay the U.S. government $45.0 billion preferred stock investment provided under TARP. In accordance with the approval, on December 9, 2009, we repurchased all outstanding shares of Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock Series N, Series Q and Series R issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP. While participating in the TARP we recorded $7.4 billion in dividends and accretion on the TARP Preferred Stock and repayment saved us approximately $3.6 billion in annual dividends and accretion. We did not repurchase the related common stock warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with its TARP investment. The U.S. Treasury auctioned these warrants in March 2010. For more detail on the TARP Preferred Stock, refer to Note 15 Shareholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We repurchased the TARP Preferred Stock through the use of $25.7 billion in excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion units of CES valued at $15.00 per unit. The CES consisted of depositary shares representing interests in shares of Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and warrants (Contingent Warrants) to purchase an aggregate 60 million shares of the Corporation common stock. Each depositary share represented a 1/1,000 th interest in a share of Common Equivalent Stock and each Contingent Warrant granted the holder the right to purchase 0.0467 of a share of a common stock for $0.01 per share. Each depositary share entitled the holder, through the depository, to a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences of the Common Equivalent Stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights. The Corporation held a special meeting of stockholders on February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock. Following effectiveness of the amendment, on February 24, 2010, the Common Equivalent Stock converted in full into our common stock and the Contingent Warrants automatically expired without becoming exercisable, and the CES ceased to exist. On October 15, 2010, all of the outstanding shares of the mandatory convertible Preferred Stock, Series 2 and Series 3, of Merrill Lynch automatically converted into an aggregate of 50 million shares of the Corporation Common Stock in accordance with the terms of these preferred securities. For more information on cash dividends declared on preferred stock, see Table III. Enterprise-wide Stress Testing As a part of our core risk management practices, we conduct enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile to earnings, capital and liquidity, and serve as a key component of our capital management practices. Scenarios are selected by a group comprised of senior line of business, risk and finance executives. Impacts to each line of business from each scenario are then determined and analyzed, primarily leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), Asset Liability Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) and the Board Enterprise Risk Committee, and serves to inform and be incorporated, along with other core business processes, into decision-making by management and the Board. We have made substantial investments to establish stress testing capabilities as a core business process. Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise. Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. The Enterprise Risk Committee approves the Corporation liquidity policy and contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The ALMRC, in conjunction with the Board and its committees, monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. ALMRC is responsible for managing liquidity risks and ensuring exposures remain within the established tolerance levels. ALMRC delegates additional oversight responsibilities to the ROC, which reports to ALMRC. The ROC reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and implements our liquidity limits and guidelines. For more information, refer to Board Oversight of Risk beginning on page 61. Under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining excess Bank of America 2010 67 Table of Contents liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries; determining what amounts of excess liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning. Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain excess liquidity available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These assets serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation and we call these assets our Global Excess Liquidity Sources. Our cash is primarily on deposit with central banks, such as the Federal Reserve. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global Excess Liquidity Sources in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our global excess liquidity sources increased $122 billion to $336 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $214 billion at December 31, 2009 and were maintained as presented in the table below. This increase was due primarily to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through deposit growth, loan repayments combined with lower loan demand and other factors. Table 16 Global Excess Liquidity Sources December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2010 2009 Parent company $ 121 $ 99 Bank subsidiaries 180 89 Broker/dealers 35 26 Total global excess liquidity sources $ 336 $ 214 As noted above, the excess liquidity available to the parent company is held in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities and totaled $121 billion and $99 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with Bank of America, N.A. Our bank subsidiaries excess liquidity sources at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $180 billion and $89 billion. These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company, as described above. In addition to their excess liquidity sources, our bank subsidiaries hold significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe could also be used to generate liquidity, such as investment-grade ABS, MBS and municipal bonds. Another way our bank subsidiaries can generate incremental liquidity is by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was approximately $170 billion and $187 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and cannot be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries. Our broker/dealer subsidiaries excess liquidity sources at December 31, 2010 and 2009 consisted of $35 billion and $26 billion in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our broker/dealers also held significant amounts of other unencumbered securities we believe could also be used to generate additional liquidity, including investment-grade corporate securities and equities. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary is only available to meet the obligations of that entity and cannot be transferred to the parent company or to any other subsidiary, often due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is Time to Required Funding. This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., including certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured notes, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. The ALMRC has established a target for Time to Required Funding of 21 months. Time to Required Funding was 24 months at December 31, 2010 compared to 25 months at December 31, 2009. We utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. These risk sensitive models have become increasingly important in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond those outflows considered in the Time to Required Funding analysis. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit ratings downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. The types of contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to: upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals and reduced rollover of maturing term deposits by customers; increased draws on loan commitments and liquidity facilities; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral, margin and subsidiary capital requirements arising from losses; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Basel III Liquidity Standards In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision issued International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, which includes two measures of liquidity risk. These two minimum liquidity measures were initially introduced in guidance in December 2009 and are considered part of Basel III. The first liquidity measure is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which identifies the amount of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets a financial institution holds that can be used to offset the net cash outflows the institution would encounter under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The second 68 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents liquidity measure is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) which measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Basel Committee expects the LCR to be implemented in January 2015 and the NSFR in January 2018, following observation periods beginning in 2012. We continue to monitor the development and the potential impact of these evolving proposals and expect to be able to meet the final requirements. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor bases. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposit base which was $1.0 trillion and $992 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Deposits are primarily generated by our Deposits, Global Commercial Banking, GWIM and GBAM segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography. Certain of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Certain consumer lending activities, primarily in our banking subsidiaries, may be funded through securitizations. Included in these consumer lending activities are the extension of mortgage, credit card, auto loans, home equity loans and lines of credit. If securitization markets are not available to us on favorable terms, we typically finance these loans with deposits or with wholesale borrowings. For additional information on securitizations, see Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our trading activities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements; these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. Unsecured debt, both short- and long-term, is also an important source of funding. We may issue unsecured debt through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and unregistered medium-term note programs, non-U.S. medium-term note programs, non-U.S. private placements, U.S. and non-U.S. commercial paper and through other methods. We distribute a significant portion of our debt offerings through our retail and institutional sales forces to a large, diversified global investor base. Maintaining relationships with our investors is an important aspect of our funding strategy. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding Bank of America Corporation debt securities in various transactions, depending upon prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, we may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. In addition, our parent company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries regularly access short-term secured and unsecured markets through federal funds purchased, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings to support customer activities, short-term financing requirements and cash management. At December 31, 2010, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings included $6.7 billion of VIEs that were consolidated in accordance with new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010. For average and year-end balance discussions, see Balance Sheet Overview beginning on page 29. For more information, see Note 12 Federal Funds Sold, Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the parent company and Bank of America, N.A. During 2010, the parent company and Bank of America, N.A. issued $28.8 billion and $3.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt. We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our long-term debt was in the currencies presented in the table below. Table 17 Long-term Debt By Major Currency December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 U.S. Dollar $ 302,487 $ 281,692 Euros 87,482 99,917 Japanese Yen 19,901 19,903 British Pound 16,505 16,460 Australian Dollar 6,924 7,973 Canadian Dollar 6,628 4,894 Swiss Franc 3,069 2,666 Other 5,435 5,016 Total long-term debt $ 448,431 $ 438,521 At December 31, 2010, the above table includes $71.0 billion of primarily U.S. Dollar long-term debt of VIEs that were consolidated in accordance with new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010. We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, refer to Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 103. We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these notes with derivative positions and/or in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to immediately settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the Bank of America 2010 69 Table of Contents earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured notes of $61.1 billion and $57.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. We participated in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) which allowed us to issue senior unsecured debt that the FDIC guaranteed in return for a fee based on the amount and maturity of the debt. At December 31, 2010, we had $27.5 billion outstanding under the program. We no longer issue debt under this program and all of our debt issued under TLGP will mature by June 30, 2012. Under this program, our debt received the highest long-term ratings from the major credit ratings agencies which resulted in a lower total cost of issuance than if we had issued non-FDIC guaranteed long-term debt. The associated FDIC fee for the 2009 issuances was $554 million and is being amortized into expense over the stated term of the debt. For additional information on debt funding, see Note 13 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies, and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control, such as ratings agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the recent difficulties in the financial services industry and financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. During 2009 and 2010, the ratings agencies took numerous actions, many of which were negative, to adjust our credit ratings and the outlooks for those ratings. Currently, Bank of America Corporation long-term senior debt and outlook expressed by the ratings agencies are as follows: A2 (negative) by Moody Investors Services, Inc. (Moody s), A (negative) by Standard and Poor Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), and A+ (Rating Watch Negative) by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch). Bank of America, N.A. long-term debt and outlook currently are as follows: A+ (negative), Aa3 (negative) and A+ (Rating Watch Negative) by those same three credit ratings agencies, respectively. The ratings agencies have indicated that, as a systemically important financial institution, our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government. All three ratings agencies, however, have indicated they will reevaluate, and could reduce the uplift they include in our ratings for government support for reasons arising from financial services regulatory reform proposals or legislation. In February 2010, S&P affirmed our current credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable based on its belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary support. On July 27, 2010, Moody affirmed our current ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable due to its expectation for lower levels of government support over time as a result of the passage of the Financial Reform Act. Also, on October 22, 2010, Fitch placed our credit ratings on Rating Watch Negative from stable outlook due to proposed rulemaking that could negatively impact its assessment of future systemic government support. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the ratings agencies methodologies, the ratings agencies assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. Under the terms of certain OTC derivatives contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of a credit ratings downgrade, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral or to terminate these contracts or agreements. Such collateral calls or terminations could cause us to sustain losses, impair our liquidity, or both, by requiring us to provide the counterparties with additional collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. If Bank of America Corporation or Bank of America, N.A. commercial paper or short-term credit ratings (which currently have the following ratings: P-1 by Moody s, A-1 by S&P and F1+ by Fitch) were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of short-term funding sources such as commercial paper or repo financing and effect on our incremental cost of funds would be material. For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that would be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit ratings downgrade, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors. The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. from the three major credit ratings agencies are the same as those of Bank of America Corporation. The major credit ratings agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch credit ratings are Bank of America Corporation credit ratings. 70 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Credit Risk Management Credit quality continued to show improvement during 2010; although, net charge-offs, and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties remained elevated. Signs of economic stability and our proactive credit risk management initiatives positively impacted the credit portfolio as charge-offs and delinquencies continued to improve across almost all portfolios along with risk rating improvements in the commercial portfolio. Global and national economic uncertainty, regulatory initiatives and reform, however, continued to weigh on the credit portfolios through December 31, 2010. For more information, see 2010 Economic and Business Environment on page 25. Credit metrics were also impacted by loans added to the balance sheet on January 1, 2010 in connection with the adoption of new consolidation guidance. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for these categories of assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current mark-to-market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded credit exposures. For additional information on derivative and credit extension commitments, see Note 4 Derivatives and Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below. We proactively refine our underwriting and credit management practices, as well as credit standards, to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have expanded collections, loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We also have implemented a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits approach criticized levels. Since January 2008, and through 2010, Bank of America and Countrywide have completed nearly 775,000 loan modifications with customers. During 2010, we completed nearly 285,000 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $65.7 billion, which included 109,000 customers who converted from trial period to permanent modifications under the government MHA program. Of the loan modifications completed in 2010, in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, most were in the portfolio serviced for investors and were not on our balance sheet. The most common types of modifications during the year include a combination of rate reduction and capitalization of past due amounts which represent 68 percent of the volume of modifications completed in 2010, while principal forbearance represented 15 percent and capitalization of past due amounts represented nine percent. We also provide rate reductions, rate and payment extensions, principal forgiveness and other actions. These modification types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity beginning on page 81 and Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 1, 2010, we voluntarily stopped taking residential mortgage foreclosure proceedings to judgment in judicial states. On October 8, 2010, we stopped foreclosure sales in all states in order to complete an assessment of the related business processes. As a result of that assessment, we identified and began implementing process and control enhancements and we intend to monitor ongoing quality results of each process. After these enhancements were put in place, we resumed foreclosure sales in most non-judicial states during the fourth quarter of 2010, and expect sales to resume in the remaining non-judicial states in the first quarter of 2011. The process of preparing affidavits in pending proceedings in judicial states is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2011 and could result in prolonged adversary proceedings that delay certain foreclosure sales. We took these precautionary steps in order to ensure our processes for handling foreclosures include the appropriate controls and quality assurance. These initiatives further support our credit risk management and mitigation efforts. For more information, see Recent Events beginning on page 33. Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress. Risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in Europe could result in a disruption of the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery, including the impact of non-sovereign debt in these countries. For more information on our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in these countries, see Non-U.S. Portfolio beginning on page 94. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new disclosure guidance, effective on a prospective basis for the Corporation 2010 year-end reporting, that addresses disclosure of loans and other financing receivables and the related allowance. The new disclosure guidance defines a portfolio segment as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial. The classes within the home loans portfolio segment are residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate. The classes within the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment are U.S. credit card, non-U.S. credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within the commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing, non-U.S. commercial and U.S. small business commercial. Under this new disclosure guidance, the allowance is presented by portfolio segment. Bank of America 2010 71 Table of Contents Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used, in part, to help determine both new and existing credit decisions, portfolio management strategies including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, and economic capital allocations for credit risk. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consumer Credit Portfolio Although unemployment rates remained at elevated levels, improvement in the U.S. economy and stabilization in the labor markets during 2010 resulted in lower losses and lower delinquencies in almost all consumer portfolios during 2010 when compared to 2009 on a managed basis. However, economic deterioration throughout 2009 and weakness in the economic recovery in 2010 drove continued stress in the housing markets and tighter availability of credit in the market place resulting in elevated net charge-offs in most portfolios. In addition, during 2010, our consumer real estate portfolios were impacted by net charge-offs on certain modified loans deemed to be collateral dependent pursuant to clarification of regulatory guidance. For more information on regulatory guidance on collateral dependent modified loans, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56. Under the new consolidation guidance, we consolidated all previously off-balance sheet securitized credit card receivables along with certain home equity and auto loan securitization trusts. The 2010 consumer credit card credit quality statistics include the impact of consolidation of VIEs. The following tables include the December 31, 2009 balances as well as the January 1, 2010 balances to show the impact of the adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Accordingly, the December 31, 2010 credit quality statistics under the new consolidation guidance should be compared to the amounts presented in the January 1, 2010 column. The table below presents our outstanding consumer loans and the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Loans that were acquired from Countrywide and considered credit-impaired were written down to fair value upon acquisition. In addition to being included in the Outstandings columns in the table below, these loans are also shown separately, net of purchase accounting adjustments, in the Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio column. Loans that were acquired from Merrill Lynch were recorded at fair value including those that were considered credit-impaired upon acquisition. The Merrill Lynch consumer PCI loan portfolio did not materially alter the reported credit quality statistics of the consumer portfolios and is, therefore, excluded from the Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio column and the following discussion. For additional information, see Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate. See Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio beginning on page 78 for more information. Under certain circumstances, loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition have been subsequently modified from pay option or subprime loans into loans with more conventional terms and are now included in the residential mortgage portfolio shown below.

(5) Outstandings include consumer finance loans of $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion, other non-U.S. consumer loans of $803 million and $709 million and consumer overdrafts of $88 million and $144 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. n/a = not applicable 72 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents The table below presents our accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more and our consumer nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer non-real estate-secured loans or unsecured consumer loans as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans insured by the FHA are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured by the FHA. FHA insured loans accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily related to our purchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the Countrywide PCI loans even though the customer may be contractually past due.

(2) Our policy is to classify consumer real estate-secured loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due, except Countrywide PCI loans and FHA loans as referenced in footnote (3). (3) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, balances accruing past due 90 days or more represent loans insured by the FHA. These balances include $8.3 billion and $2.2 billion of loans that are no longer accruing interest or interest has been curtailed by the FHA although principal is still insured and $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion of loans that were still accruing interest. Our policy is to classify delinquent consumer loans secured by real estate and insured by the FHA as accruing past due 90 days or more. n/a = not applicable Accruing consumer loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases were 3.38 percent (0.90 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios) and 2.74 percent (0.79 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios) at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Nonperforming consumer loans as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans were 3.24 percent (3.76 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios) and 3.61 percent (3.95 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios) at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The table below presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our consumer loans and leases for 2010 and 2009 (managed basis for 2009).

These are the only product classifications materially impacted by the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio for 2010 and 2009. For all loan and lease categories, the net charge-offs were unchanged. n/a = not applicable We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate portfolios, we provide information that is adjusted to exclude the impact of the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios. In addition, beginning on page 78, we separately disclose information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Bank of America 2010 73 Table of Contents Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio, which excludes the discontinued real estate portfolio acquired with Countrywide, makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 40 percent of consumer loans at December 31, 2010. Approximately 14 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our affluent clients. The remaining portion of the portfolio is mostly in All Other and is comprised of both residential loans originated for our customers and used in our overall ALM activities as well as purchased loans. Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $15.8 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 as new FHA insured origination volume was partially offset by paydowns, the sale of First Republic, transfers to foreclosed properties and charge-offs. In addition, FHA repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also increased the residential mortgage portfolio during 2010. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the residential mortgage portfolio included $53.9 billion and $12.9 billion of outstanding loans that were insured by the FHA. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of FHA insurance. The table below presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impacts of the Countrywide PCI and FHA insured loan portfolios is more representative of the credit risk in this portfolio. For more information on the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, see the discussion beginning on page 78.

We have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on the residential mortgage portfolio through the use of synthetic securitization vehicles and long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC as described in Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the synthetic securitization vehicles referenced $53.9 billion and $70.7 billion of residential mortgage loans and provided loss protection up to $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Corporation had a receivable of $722 million and $1.0 billion from these vehicles for reimbursement of losses. The Corporation records an allowance for credit losses on loans referenced by the synthetic securitization vehicles. The reported net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio do not include the benefit of amounts reimbursable from these vehicles. Adjusting for the benefit of the credit protection from the synthetic securitizations, the residential mortgage net charge-off ratio for 2010 would have been reduced by seven bps compared to 27 bps for 2009. Synthetic securitizations and the protection provided by FNMA and FHLMC together mitigated risk on 35 percent of our residential mortgage portfolio at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. These credit protection agreements reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, these transactions had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $8.6 billion and $16.8 billion, and increased our Tier 1 capital ratio by seven bps and 11 bps and our Tier 1 common capital ratio by five bps and eight bps. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $14.3 billion and $6.6 billion in loans were protected by long-term standby agreements. The Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses on loans protected by these long-term standby agreements. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans increased $1.1 billion compared to December 31, 2009 as new inflows, which continued to slow in 2010 due to favorable delinquency trends, continued to outpace nonperforming loans returning to performing status, charge-offs, and paydowns and payoffs. At December 31, 2010, $12.7 billion, or 72 percent, of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral. Net charge-offs decreased $680 million to $3.7 billion in 2010, or 1.79 percent of total average residential mortgage loans compared to 1.83 percent for 2009 driven primarily by favorable delinquency trends which were due in part to improvement in the U.S. economy. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower loan balances primarily due to paydowns, the sale of First Republic and charge-offs. Certain risk characteristics of the residential mortgage portfolio continued to contribute to higher losses. These characteristics include loans with a high refreshed loan-to-value (LTV), loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007, loans to borrowers located in California and Florida where we have concentrations and where significant declines in home prices have been experienced, as well as interest-only loans. Although the following disclosures address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which contributed to a disproportionate share of the losses in the portfolio. The residential mortgage loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised five percent and seven percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, but accounted for 26 percent of the residential mortgage net charge-offs in 2010 compared to 31 percent in 2009. 74 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed LTV represented 10 percent and 11 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented 23 percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 88 percent were performing at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent due primarily to home price deterioration from the weakened economy. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 14 percent and 12 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represented 38 percent and 42 percent of our residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, have higher refreshed LTVs and accounted for 67 percent and 69 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These vintages of loans accounted for 77 percent of residential mortgage net charge-offs during 2010 and 75 percent during 2009. The table below presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. California and Florida combined represented 42 percent of outstandings and 48 percent of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010. These states accounted for 54 percent of the net charge-offs for 2010 compared to 58 percent for 2009. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 13 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2010 and 2009, but comprised only seven percent of net charge-offs for both 2010 and 2009.

Of the residential mortgage loans, $62.5 billion, or 32 percent, at December 31, 2010 are interest-only loans of which 87 percent were performing. Nonperforming balances on interest-only residential mortgage loans were $8.0 billion, or 45 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgages. Additionally, net charge-offs on the interest-only portion of the portfolio represented 53 percent of the total residential mortgage net charge-offs during 2010. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. At December 31, 2010, our CRA portfolio was eight percent of the residential mortgage loan balances but comprised 17 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. This portfolio also represented 23 percent of residential mortgage net charge-offs during 2010. For information on representations and warranties related to our residential mortgage portfolio, see Representations and Warranties beginning on page 52 and Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Home Equity The home equity portfolio makes up 21 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At December 31, 2010, approximately 88 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in Home Loans & Insurance , while the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $11.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due to charge-offs, paydowns and the sale of First Republic, partially offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance, which resulted in the consolidation of $5.1 billion of home equity loans on January 1, 2010. Of the loans in the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, $24.8 billion and $26.0 billion, or 18 percent for both periods, were in first-lien positions (20 percent and 19 percent excluding the Countrywide PCI home equity loan portfolio). For more information on the Countrywide PCI home equity loan portfolio, see the discussion beginning on page 78. Home equity unused lines of credit totaled $80.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $92.7 billion at December 31, 2009. This decrease was due primarily to account attrition as well as line management initiatives on deteriorating accounts and the sale of First Republic, which more than offset new production. The home equity line of credit utilization rate was 59 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to 57 percent at December 31, 2009. Bank of America 2010 75 Table of Contents The table below presents certain home equity key credit statistics on both a reported basis as well as excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. We believe the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impacts of the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio is more representative of the credit risk in this portfolio. Table 23 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics December 31 Excluding Countrywide Purchased Credit- Reported Basis impaired Loans (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Outstandings $ 137,981 $ 149,126 $ 125,391 $ 135,912 Nonperforming loans 2,694 3,804 2,694 3,804 Percent of portfolio with refreshed CLTVs greater than 90 but less than 100 11 % 12 % 11 % 12 % Percent of portfolio with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 34 35 30 31 Percent of portfolio with refreshed FICOs below 620 14 13 12 13 Percent of portfolio in the 2006 and 2007 vintages 50 52 47 49 Net charge-off ratio 4.65 4.56 5.10 5.00 The following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Nonperforming home equity loans decreased $1.1 billion to $2.7 billion compared to December 31, 2009 driven primarily by charge-offs, including those recorded in connection with regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on collateral dependent modified loans, and nonperforming loans returning to performing status which together outpaced delinquency inflows and the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance. At December 31, 2010, $916 million, or 34 percent, of the nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their fair values. Net charge-offs decreased $269 million to $6.8 billion, or 5.10 percent, of total average home equity loans for 2010 compared to $7.1 billion, or 5.00 percent, for 2009. The decrease was primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in the U.S. economy. This was partially offset by $822 million of net charge-offs related to the implementation of regulatory guidance on collateral dependent modified loans and $463 million of net charge-offs related to home equity loans that were consolidated on January 1, 2010 under new consolidation guidance. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower loan balances primarily as a result of charge-offs, paydowns and the sale of First Republic. There are certain risk characteristics of the home equity portfolio which have contributed to higher losses including loans with a high refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV), loans originated at the peak of home prices in 2006 and 2007 and loans in geographic areas that have experienced the most significant declines in home prices. Home price declines coupled with the fact that most home equity loans are secured by second-lien positions have significantly reduced and, in some cases, eliminated all collateral value after consideration of the first-lien position. Although the following disclosures address each of these risk characteristics separately, there is significant overlap in loans with these characteristics, which has contributed to a disproportionate share of losses in the portfolio. Home equity loans with all of these higher risk characteristics comprised 10 percent and 11 percent of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, but have accounted for 29 percent of the home equity net charge-offs in 2010 compared to 38 percent in 2009. Home equity loans with greater than 90 percent but less than 100 percent refreshed CLTVs comprised 11 percent and 12 percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised 30 percent and 31 percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of those loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 97 percent were performing at December 31, 2010 while 95 percent were performing at December 31, 2009. Home equity loans and lines of credit with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the LTV of the first lien, there may be collateral in excess of the first lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second lien. The majority of these high refreshed CLTV ratios are due to home price declines. In addition, loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 12 percent and 13 percent of the home equity loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the total home equity portfolio, 75 percent and 72 percent at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were interest-only loans. The 2006 and 2007 vintage loans, which represent 47 percent and 49 percent of our home equity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, have higher refreshed CLTVs and accounted for 57 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2010 compared to 62 percent at December 31, 2009. These vintages of loans accounted for 66 percent of net charge-offs in 2010 compared to 72 percent in 2009. 76 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents The table below presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity loan portfolio. California and Florida combined represented 40 percent of the total home equity portfolio and 44 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2010. These states accounted for 55 percent of the home equity net charge-offs for 2010 compared to 60 percent of the home equity net charge-offs for 2009. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of outstanding home equity loans at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. This MSA comprised only six percent of net charge-offs for both 2010 and 2009. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of outstanding home equity loans at both December 31, 2010 and 2009 and comprised 11 percent of net charge-offs for 2010 compared to 13 percent for 2009.

Discontinued Real Estate The discontinued real estate portfolio, totaling $13.1 billion at December 31, 2010, consisted of pay option and subprime loans acquired in the Countrywide acquisition. Upon acquisition, the majority of the discontinued real estate portfolio was considered credit-impaired and written down to fair value. At December 31, 2010, the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio comprised $11.7 billion, or 89 percent, of the total discontinued real estate portfolio. This portfolio is included in All Other and is managed as part of our overall ALM activities. See Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio beginning on page 78 for more information on the discontinued real estate portfolio. At December 31, 2010, the purchased discontinued real estate portfolio that was not credit-impaired was $1.4 billion. Loans with greater than 90 percent refreshed LTVs and CLTVs comprised 29 percent of the portfolio and those with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented 46 percent of the portfolio. California represented 37 percent of the portfolio and 34 percent of the nonperforming loans while Florida represented 10 percent of the portfolio and 15 percent of the nonperforming loans at December 31, 2010. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 16 percent of outstanding discontinued real estate loans at December 31, 2010. Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the discontinued real estate portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting of the loan if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five or 10-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loan principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully amortizing payment is required. The difference between the frequency of changes in the loans interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest charges are added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. At December 31, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans was $14.6 billion, with a carrying amount of $11.8 billion, including $11.0 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $12.5 billion including $858 million of negative amortization. The percentage of borrowers electing to make only the minimum payment on option ARMs was 69 percent at December 31, 2010. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the Countrywide PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration several assumptions regarding this evaluation (e.g., prepayment rates). Based on our expectations, 11 percent and three percent of the pay option loan portfolio are expected to reset in 2011 and 2012. Approximately four percent are expected to reset thereafter and approximately 82 percent are expected to default or repay prior to being reset. Bank of America 2010 77 Table of Contents Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the purchaser initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date may include statistics such as past due status, refreshed FICO scores and refreshed LTVs. PCI loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and the applicable accounting guidance prohibits carrying over or recording valuation allowances in the initial accounting. The Merrill Lynch PCI consumer loan portfolio did not materially alter the reported credit quality statistics of the consumer portfolios. As such, the Merrill Lynch consumer PCI loans are excluded from the following discussion and credit statistics. Acquired loans from Countrywide that were considered credit-impaired were written down to fair value at the acquisition date. The following table presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, allowance for loan and lease losses and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. Table 25 Countrywide Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio December 31, 2010 Unpaid Carrying % of Principal Carrying Related Value Net of Unpaid Principal (Dollars in millions) Balance Value Allowance Allowance Balance Residential mortgage $ 11,481 $ 10,592 $ 229 $ 10,363 90.26 % Home equity 15,072 12,590 4,514 8,076 53.58 Discontinued real estate 14,893 11,652 1,591 10,061 67.56 Total Countrywide purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio $ 41,446 $ 34,834 $ 6,334 $ 28,500 68.76 % Of the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2010, $15.5 billion was 180 days or more past due, including $10.9 billion of first-lien and $4.6 billion of home equity. Of the $25.9 billion that is less than 180 days past due, $21.5 billion, or 83 percent of the total unpaid principal balance, was current based on the contractual terms while $2.2 billion, or eight percent, was in early stage delinquency. During 2010, we recorded $2.3 billion of provision for credit losses on PCI loans which was comprised mainly of $1.4 billion for home equity and $689 million for discontinued real estate loans compared to a total provision for PCI loans of $3.3 billion in 2009. Provision expense in 2010 was driven primarily by a slower pace of expected recovery in home prices, the result of a deteriorating view on defaults on more seasoned loans in the portfolio and a reassessment of modification and short sale benefits as we gain more experience with troubled borrowers. The Countrywide PCI allowance for loan losses increased $2.5 billion from December 31, 2009 to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2010 as a result of the increase in the provision for credit losses and the reclassification of a portion of nonaccretable difference to the allowance. For further information on the PCI loan portfolio, see Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information on the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued real estate loan portfolios follows. Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio The Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio outstandings were $10.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and comprised 30 percent of the total Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 38 percent of the Countrywide PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. Refreshed LTVs greater than 90 percent represented 68 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and 82 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2010. Those loans that were originally classified as discontinued real estate loans upon acquisition and have been subsequently modified are now included in the residential mortgage outstandings. The table below presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments, by certain state concentrations.

Managed basis assumed that securitized loans were not sold into credit card securitizations and presented credit quality information as if the loans had not been sold. Under the new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010, we consolidated the credit card securitization trusts and the new held basis is comparable to the previously reported managed basis. For more information on the adoption of the new consolidation guidance, see Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents certain U.S. credit card key credit statistics on a held basis for 2010 and managed basis for December 31, 2009.

Outstandings in the U.S. credit card loan portfolio increased $64.3 billion compared to December 31, 2009 due to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Compared to 2009, net charge-offs increased $6.5 billion to $13.0 billion also due to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $2.0 billion while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $1.2 billion compared to December 31, 2009 due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance. Compared to December 31, 2009 on a managed basis, outstandings decreased $15.9 billion primarily as a result of charge-offs and lower origination volume. Net losses decreased $3.9 billion due to lower levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of improvement in the U.S. economy compared to 2009 on a managed basis. The net charge-off ratio was 11.04 percent of total average U.S. credit card loans in 2010 compared to 12.07 percent in 2009 on a managed basis. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $4.0 billion and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $2.1 billion compared to December 31, 2009 on a managed basis. These declines were due to improvement in the U.S. economy including stabilization in the levels of unemployment.

Table 30 U.S. Credit Card State Concentrations December 31 Year Ended December 31 Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 California $ 17,028 $ 20,048 $ 612 $ 1,097 $ 2,752 $ 3,558 Florida 9,121 10,858 376 676 1,611 2,178 Texas 7,581 8,653 207 345 784 960 New York 6,862 7,839 192 295 694 855 New Jersey 4,579 5,168 132 189 452 559 Other U.S. 68,614 77,076 1,801 2,806 6,734 8,852 Total U.S. credit card portfolio $ 113,785 $ 129,642 $ 3,320 $ 5,408 $ 13,027 $ 16,962 Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $399.7 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $438.5 billion at December 31, 2009 on a managed basis. The $38.8 billion decrease was driven by a combination of account management initiatives on higher risk or inactive accounts and tighter underwriting standards for new originations. Non-U.S. Credit Card Prior to the adoption of new consolidation guidance, the non-U.S. credit card portfolio was reported on both a held and managed basis. Under the new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010, we consolidated the credit card securitization trusts and the new held basis is comparable to the previously reported managed basis. For more information on the adoption of the new consolidation guidance, see Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents certain non-U.S. credit card key credit statistics on a held basis for 2010 and managed basis for December 31, 2009. Table 31 Non-U.S. Credit Card Key Credit Statistics December 31 January 1 December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 (1) 2010 (1) 2009 Outstandings $ 27,465 $ 31,182 $ 21,656 Accruing past due 30 days or more 1,354 1,744 1,104 Accruing past due 90 days or more 599 814 515 2010 2009 Net charge-offs Amount $ 2,207 $ 1,239 Ratio 7.88 % 6.30 % Supplemental managed basis data Amount n/a $ 2,223 Ratio n/a 7.43 % (1) Balances reflect the impact of new consolidation guidance. n/a = not applicable The consumer non-U.S. credit card portfolio is managed in Global Card Services . Outstandings in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio increased $5.8 billion compared to December 31, 2009 due to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Additionally, net charge-off levels and ratios for 2010, when compared to 2009, were impacted by the adoption of the new consolidation guidance. Net charge-offs increased $1.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2010. Outstandings declined $3.7 billion compared to December 31, 2009 on a managed basis primarily due to charge-offs, lower origination volume and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies. Net losses were substantially flat for 2010, decreasing $16 million from managed losses in 2009. The net loss ratio increased to 7.88 percent of total average non-U.S. credit card compared to 7.43 percent in 2009, due to the decrease in outstandings. Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $60.3 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $69.6 billion at December 31, 2009 on a managed basis. The $9.3 billion decrease was driven by the combination of account management initiatives on inactive accounts, tighter underwriting standards for new originations and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, particularly the British Pound and the Euro. Direct/Indirect Consumer At December 31, 2010, approximately 48 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Global Commercial Banking (dealer financial services automotive, marine and recreational vehicle loans), 29 percent was included in GWIM (principally other non-real estate-secured, unsecured personal loans and securities-based lending margin loans), 15 percent was included in Global Card Services (consumer personal loans and other non-real estate-secured loans) and the remainder was in All Other (student loans). Outstanding loans and leases decreased $6.9 billion to $90.3 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 as lower outstandings in the Global Card Services unsecured consumer lending portfolio and the sale of a portion of the student loan portfolio were partially offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance, growth in securities-based lending and the purchase of auto receivables within the dealer financial services portfolio. Direct/indirect loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined $1.1 billion compared to December 31, 2009, to $2.6 billion due to a combination of reduced outstandings and improvement in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased $2.1 billion to $3.3 billion in 2010, or 3.45 percent of total average direct/indirect loans compared to 5.46 percent in 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced outstandings from changes in underwriting criteria and lower levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of improvement in the U.S. economy including stabilization in the levels of unemployment. An additional driver was lower net charge-offs in the dealer financial services portfolio due to the impact of higher credit quality originations and higher resale values. Net charge-offs for the unsecured consumer lending portfolio decreased $1.6 billion to $2.7 billion and the net charge-off ratio decreased to 16.74 percent in 2010 compared to 17.75 percent in 2009. Net charge-offs for the dealer financial services portfolio decreased $404 million to $487 million and the loss rate decreased to 1.08 percent in 2010 compared to 2.16 percent in 2009. 80 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents The table below presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio. Table 32 Direct/Indirect State Concentrations December 31 Year Ended December 31 Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 California $ 10,558 $ 11,664 $ 132 $ 228 $ 591 $ 1,055 Texas 7,885 8,743 78 105 262 382 Florida 6,725 7,559 80 130 343 597 New York 4,770 5,111 56 73 183 272 Georgia 2,814 3,165 44 52 126 205 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 57,556 60,994 668 900 1,831 2,952 Total direct/indirect loans $ 90,308 $ 97,236 $ 1,058 $ 1,488 $ 3,336 $ 5,463 Other Consumer At December 31, 2010, approximately 69 percent of the $2.8 billion other consumer portfolio was associated with portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited and is included in All Other . The remainder consisted of the non-U.S. consumer loan portfolio, of which the vast majority we previously exited and is largely in Global Card Services and deposit overdrafts which are recorded in Deposits. Nonperforming Consumer Loans and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 33 presents nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties activity during 2010 and 2009. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans and in general, past due consumer loans not secured by real estate as these loans are generally charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans insured by the FHA are not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured by the FHA. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio. For further information regarding nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Nonperforming loans remained relatively flat at $20.9 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $20.8 billion at December 31, 2009 as delinquency inflows to nonaccrual loans slowed driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to the improving U.S. economy. These inflows were offset by charge-offs, nonperforming loans returning to performing status, and paydowns and payoffs. The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value, after reducing the property value for costs to sell, is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA. At December 31, 2010, $15.1 billion, or 69 percent, of the nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their fair values. This was comprised of $13.9 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $1.2 billion of foreclosed properties. Foreclosed properties decreased $179 million in 2010. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date. However, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. Net changes to foreclosed properties related to PCI loans were an increase of $100 million in 2010. Not included in foreclosed properties at December 31, 2010 was $1.4 billion of real estate that was acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of delinquent FHA insured loans. We hold this real estate on our balance sheet until we convey these properties to the FHA. We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the FHA for principal and up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. Restructured Loans Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower sustained repayment performance under revised payment terms for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the Countrywide PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 33. Residential mortgage TDRs totaled $11.8 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $4.6 billion compared to December 31, 2009. Of these loans, $3.3 billion were nonperforming representing an increase of $130 million in 2010, and $8.5 billion were performing representing an increase of $4.5 billion in 2010 driven by TDRs returning to performing status and new additions. These performing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming loans in Table 33. Residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and included $921 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $2.3 billion classified as performing. At December 31, 2010, performing residential mortgage TDRs included $2.5 billion that were FHA insured. Home equity TDRs totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $673 million compared to December 31, 2009. Of these loans, $541 million were nonperforming representing a decrease of $1.2 billion in 2010 driven primarily by nonperforming TDRs returning to performing status and charge-offs taken to comply with regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on collateral dependent modified loans. Home equity TDRs that were performing in accordance with their modified terms were $1.2 billion representing an increase of $514 million in 2010. These performing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming loans in Table 33. Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $796 million at December 31, 2010 and included $245 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $551 million classified as performing. Discontinued real estate TDRs totaled $395 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $13 million in 2010. Of these loans, $206 million were nonperforming while the remaining $189 million were classified as Bank of America 2010 81 Table of Contents performing at December 31, 2010. Discontinued real estate TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $213 million at December 31, 2010 and included $97 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $116 million classified as performing. We also work with customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by renegotiating credit card, consumer lending and small business loans (the renegotiated TDR portfolio), while complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. Substantially all renegotiated portfolio modifications are considered to be TDRs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio may include modifications, both short- and long-term, of interest rates or payment amounts or a combination of interest rates and payment amounts. We make modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded from Table 33 as we do not generally classify consumer non-real estate loans as nonperforming. At December 31, 2010, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $12.1 billion of which $9.2 billion was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms, compared to an $8.1 billion portfolio, on a held basis at December 31, 2009, of which $5.9 billion was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. At December 31, 2009, our renegotiated TDR portfolio, on a managed basis, was $15.8 billion of which $11.5 billion was current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 6 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of new accounting guidance on PCI loans, beginning January 1, 2010, modifications of loans in the PCI loan portfolio do not result in removal of the loan from the PCI loan pool. TDRs in the consumer real estate portfolio that were removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to the adoption of new accounting guidance were $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, of which $426 million and $395 million were nonperforming. These nonperforming loans are excluded from the table below. Nonperforming consumer real estate TDRs, included in the table below, as a percentage of total nonperforming consumer loans and foreclosed properties, declined to 16 percent at December 31, 2010 from 21 percent at December 31, 2009. This was due to nonperforming TDRs returning to performing status and charge-offs, including those charged off to comply with regulatory guidance clarifying the timing of charge-offs on collateral dependent modified loans, both of which outpaced new additions of nonperforming TDRs.

For more information on our definition of nonperforming loans, see the discussion beginning on page 81. (2) 2009 includes $465 million of nonperforming loans acquired from Merrill Lynch. (3) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. (4) Our policy is not to classify consumer credit card and consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly are excluded from this table. (5) At December 31, 2010, 67 percent of nonperforming loans are 180 days or more past due and have been written down through charge-offs to 69 percent of the unpaid principal balance. (6) Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan into foreclosed properties. Thereafter, all gains and losses in value are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties in the table above are net of $575 million and $818 million of charge-offs during 2010 and 2009, taken during the first 90 days after transfer. (7) 2009 includes $21 million of foreclosed properties acquired from Merrill Lynch. n/a = not applicable 82 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile, or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our lines of business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses. For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 38, 42, 48 and 49 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndication of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss). Commercial Credit Portfolio U.S.-based loan balances continued to decline on weak loan demand as businesses aggressively managed their working capital and production capacity by maintaining lean inventories, staff levels, physical locations and capital expenditures. Additionally, many borrowers continued to access the capital markets for financing while reducing their use of bank credit facilities. Risk mitigation strategies and net charge-offs further contributed to the decline in loan balances. Fourth-quarter balances showed stabilization relative to prior quarters. Non-U.S. commercial loans showed strong growth from client demand, driven by regional economic conditions and the positive impact of our initiatives in Asia and other emerging markets. Reservable criticized balances, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in the commercial credit portfolio declined in 2010. These reductions were driven primarily by the U.S. commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. U.S. commercial was driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients, industries and lines of business. Commercial real estate also continued to show signs of stabilization during 2010; however, levels of stressed commercial real estate loans remained elevated. Most other credit indicators across the remaining commercial portfolio have also improved. Table 34 presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Loans that were acquired from Merrill Lynch that were considered purchased credit-impaired were written down to fair value upon acquisition and amounted to $204 million and $692 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These loans are excluded from the nonperforming loans and accruing balances 90 days or more past due even though the customer may be contractually past due.

See Note 23 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the fair value option. Bank of America 2010 83 Table of Contents Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were 3.32 percent (3.35 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) and 3.98 percent (4.00 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Accruing commercial loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were 0.21 percent (0.22 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) and 0.34 percent (0.32 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Table 35 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for 2010 and 2009. Commercial real estate net charge-offs for 2010 declined in the homebuilder portfolio and in certain segments of the non-homebuilder portfolio.

Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which the Corporation is legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure decreased $68.1 billion, or eight percent, at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 driven primarily by reductions in both funded and unfunded loan and lease exposure. Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $45.1 billion, or nine percent, at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Utilized loans and leases declined as businesses continued to aggressively manage working capital and production capacity, maintain low inventories and defer capital expenditures as the economic outlook remained uncertain. Clients also continued to access the capital markets for their funding needs to reduce reliance on bank credit facilities. The decline in utilized loans and leases was also due to the sale of First Republic effective July 1, 2010 and the transfer of certain exposures into LHFS partially offset by the increase in conduit balances related to the adoption of new consolidation guidance. The utilization rate for loans and leases, letters of credit and financial guarantees, and bankers acceptances was 57 percent at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(4) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $58.3 billion and $51.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional derivative collateral held of $17.7 billion and $16.2 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities. (5) Total commercial committed exposure consists of $14.2 billion and $9.8 billion of debt securities and $590 million and $3.5 billion of other investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009. 84 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Table 37 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. In addition to reservable loans and leases, excluding those accounted for under the fair value option, exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified time period. Although funds have not been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $16.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009, due to decreases across all portfolios, primarily U.S. commercial and commercial real estate driven largely by continued paydowns, payoffs and, to a diminishing extent, charge-offs. Despite the improvements, utilized reservable criticized levels remain elevated in commercial real estate. At December 31, 2010, approximately 88 percent of the loans within commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure were secured.

(2) Excludes U.S. small business commercial exposure. U.S. Commercial At December 31, 2010, 57 percent and 25 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, were included in Global Commercial Banking and GBAM . The remaining 18 percent was mostly included in GWIM (business-purpose loans for wealthy clients). Outstanding U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $5.8 billion primarily due to reduced customer demand and continued client utilization of the capital markets, partially offset by the adoption of new consolidation guidance which increased loans by $5.3 billion on January 1, 2010. Compared to December 31, 2009, reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans and leases declined $11.1 billion and $1.5 billion. The declines were broad-based in terms of borrowers and industries and were driven by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net charge-offs decreased $1.3 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. Commercial Real Estate The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Commercial Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans decreased $20.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due to portfolio attrition, the sale of First Republic, transfer of certain assets to LHFS and net charge-offs. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represents the largest state concentration at 18 percent of commercial real estate loans and leases at December 31, 2010. For more information on geographic and property concentrations, refer to Table 38. Credit quality for commercial real estate is showing signs of stabilization; however, we expect that elevated unemployment and ongoing pressure on vacancy and rental rates will continue to affect primarily the non-homebuilder portfolio. Compared to December 31, 2009, nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased in the homebuilder, retail and land development property types, partially offset by an increase in office and multi-use property types. Reservable criticized balances declined by $3.3 billion primarily due to stabilization in the homebuilder portfolio and retail and unsecured segments in the non-homebuilder portfolio, partially offset by continued deterioration in the multi-family rental and office property types within the non-homebuilder portfolio. Net charge-offs decreased $685 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to declines in the homebuilder portfolio resulting from a slower rate of declining appraisal values. Bank of America 2010 85 Table of Contents The table below presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region and property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non owner-occupied real estate which are dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The decline in California is due primarily to the sale of First Republic.

(5) Represents loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate, but the exposure is not secured by the listed property types or is unsecured. During 2010, we continued to see stabilization in the homebuilder portfolio. Certain portions of the non-homebuilder portfolio remain most at-risk as occupancy rates, rental rates and commercial property prices remain under pressure. We have adopted a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized and potential exposure in the commercial real estate portfolios. 86 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents The tables below present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-homebuilder and homebuilder property types. The homebuilder portfolio includes condominiums and other residential real estate.

(2) Represents loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate, but the exposure is not secured by the listed property types or is unsecured. At December 31, 2010, we had total committed non-homebuilder exposure of $64.2 billion compared to $84.4 billion at December 31, 2009, with the decrease due to the sale of First Republic, repayments and net charge-offs. Non-homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were $4.6 billion, or 10.08 percent of total non-homebuilder loans and foreclosed properties at December 31, 2010 compared to $4.8 billion, or 7.73 percent, at December 31, 2009. Non-homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $17.1 billion, or 35.55 percent, at December 31, 2010 compared to $18.1 billion, or 27.27 percent, at December 31, 2009. The decrease in criticized exposure was primarily in the retail and unsecured segments, with the ratio increasing due to declining loan balances. For the non-homebuilder portfolio, net charge-offs increased $187 million for 2010 compared to 2009. The changes were concentrated in land development and retail. At December 31, 2010, we had committed homebuilder exposure of $6.0 billion compared to $10.4 billion at December 31, 2009 of which $4.3 billion and $7.3 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in homebuilder committed exposure was due to repayments, net charge-offs, reductions in new home construction and continued risk mitigation initiatives. At December 31, 2010, homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties declined $1.3 billion due to repayments, net charge-offs, fewer risk rating downgrades and a slowdown in the rate of home price declines compared to December 31, 2009. Homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased by $2.3 billion to $3.4 billion due to repayments and net charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the homebuilder portfolio were 42.80 percent and 74.27 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to 42.16 percent and 74.44 percent at December 31, 2009. Net charge-offs for the homebuilder portfolio decreased $872 million in 2010 compared to 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $19.1 billion and $27.4 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. This portfolio is mostly secured and diversified across property types and geographies but faces significant challenges in the current housing and rental markets. Weak rental Bank of America 2010 87 Table of Contents demand and cash flows, along with declining property valuations have resulted in elevated levels of reservable criticized exposure, nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties, and net charge-offs. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $10.5 billion and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $4.0 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. During a property construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest begins to be paid from operating cash flows. Loans continue to be classified as construction loans until they are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. Non-U.S. Commercial The non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio is managed primarily in GBAM . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, showed growth from client demand driven by regional economic conditions and the positive impact of our initiatives in Asia and other emerging markets. Net charge-offs decreased $426 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to stabilization in the portfolio. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, refer to Non-U.S. Portfolio beginning on page 94. U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of business card and small business loans managed in Global Card Services and Global Commercial Banking . U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs decreased $968 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Although losses remain elevated, the reduction in net charge-offs was driven by lower levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies resulting from U.S. economic improvement as well as the reduction of higher risk vintages and the impact of higher quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs for 2010, 79 percent were credit card-related products compared to 81 percent during 2009. Commercial Loans Carried at Fair Value The portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed primarily in GBAM . Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option decreased $1.6 billion to an aggregate fair value of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due primarily to reduced corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses of $89 million resulting from new originations, loans being paid off at par value and changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio during 2010 compared to net gains of $515 million during 2009. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk and were largely offset by gains or losses from hedging activities. In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit had an aggregate fair value of $866 million and $950 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and were recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option were $27.3 billion and $27.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Net gains resulting from new originations, terminations and changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit of $172 million were recorded during 2010 compared to net gains of $1.4 billion for 2009. These gains were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. 88 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity The table below presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2010 and 2009. The $2.9 billion decrease at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 was driven by paydowns, payoffs and charge-offs in the commercial real estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Approximately 95 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 40 percent are contractually current. In addition, commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 68 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated net realizable value.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. (3) Commercial loans and leases may be restored to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) Business card loans are not classified as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and accordingly are excluded from this table. (5) Outstanding commercial loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. At December 31, 2010, the total commercial TDR balance was $1.2 billion. Nonperforming TDRs were $952 million and are included in Table 41. Nonperforming TDRs increased $466 million while performing TDRs increased $147 million during 2010. U.S. commercial TDRs were $356 million, an increase of $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Nonperforming U.S. commercial TDRs decreased $52 million during 2010, while performing TDRs excluded from nonperforming loans in Table 41 increased $112 million. At December 31, 2010, the commercial real estate TDR balance was $815 million, an increase of $547 million during 2010. Nonperforming TDRs increased $524 million during the year, while performing TDRs increased $23 million. At December 31, 2010 the non-U.S. commercial TDR balance was $19 million, an increase of $6 million. Nonperforming TDRs decreased $6 million during the year, while performing TDRs increased $12 million. Industry Concentrations Table 42 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. The decline in commercial committed exposure of $68.1 billion from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 was broad-based across most industries. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits, as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Management Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced a decrease in committed exposure of $25.8 billion, or 24 percent, at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. This decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in exposure to conduits tied to the consumer finance industry. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced a decrease in committed exposure of $21.1 billion, or 23 percent, at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 due primarily to portfolio attrition. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 27 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at December 31, 2010. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, refer to Commercial Real Estate beginning on page 85. Bank of America 2010 89 Table of Contents The $11.8 billion, or 34 percent, decline in individuals and trusts committed exposure was largely due to the unwinding of two derivative transactions. Committed exposure in the banking industry increased $6.3 billion, or 27 percent, at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 primarily due to increases in both traded products and loan exposure as a result of momentum from growth initiatives. The decline of $4.5 billion, or 10 percent, in consumer services was concentrated in gaming and restaurants. Committed exposure for the commercial services and supplies industry declined $4.1 billion, or 12 percent, primarily due to reduced loan demand and the sale of First Republic. The recent economic downturn has had a residual effect on debt issued by state and local municipalities and certain exposures to these municipalities. While historically default rates were low, stress on the municipalities financials due to the economic downturn has increased the potential for defaults in the near term. As part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications surrounding certain at-risk counterparties and/or sectors are regularly circulated ensuring exposure levels are compliant with established concentration guidelines. Monoline and Related Exposure Monoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. Direct loan exposure to monolines consisted of revolvers in the amount of $51 million and $41 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities. We also have indirect exposure to monolines, primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor loss. For additional information regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties beginning on page 52. For additional information regarding monolines, see Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Monoline derivative credit exposure at December 31, 2010 had a notional value of $38.4 billion compared to $42.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was $9.2 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2009 with the decrease driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline contracts. At December 31, 2010, the counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to monoline derivative exposure was $5.3 billion compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2009. This reduced our net mark-to-market exposure to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, approximately 62 percent of this exposure was related to one monoline compared to approximately 54 percent at December 31, 2009. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. For more information on our monoline exposure, see GBAM beginning on page 45. 90 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents We also have indirect exposure to monolines as we invest in securities where the issuers have purchased wraps (i.e., insurance). For example, municipalities and corporations purchase insurance in order to reduce their cost of borrowing. If the ratings agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on the market value of the security. In the case of default, we first look to the underlying securities and then to recovery on the purchased insurance. Investments in securities issued by municipalities and corporations with purchased wraps at December 31, 2010 and 2009 had a notional value of $2.4 billion and $5.0 billion. Mark-to-market investment exposure was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2009.

For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the borrowers or counterparties primary business activity using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. (3) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. See Risk Mitigation below for additional information. Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $20.1 billion and $19.0 billion. The mark-to-market effects, including the cost of net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure, resulted in net losses of $546 million during 2010 compared to net losses of $2.9 billion in 2009. The average Value-at-Risk (VaR) for these credit derivative hedges was $53 million for 2010 compared to $76 million for 2009. The average VaR for the related credit exposure was $65 million in 2010 compared to $130 million in 2009. There is a diversification effect between the net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure and the related credit exposure such that the combined average VaR was $41 million for 2010, compared to $89 million for 2009. Refer to Trading Risk Management beginning on page 100 for a description of our VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio. Bank of America 2010 91 Table of Contents Tables 43 and 44 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

(3) In addition to names which have not been rated, NR includes $(1.5) billion and $2.3 billion in net credit default swaps index positions at December 31, 2010 and 2009. While index positions are principally investment grade, credit default swaps indices include names in and across each of the ratings categories. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 92 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents The notional amounts presented in Table 45 represent the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and include both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as the net replacement cost, in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. For information on the performance risk of our written credit derivatives, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The credit risk amounts discussed on page 92 and noted in the table below take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing the Corporation overall exposure.

These adjustments are necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment. All or a portion of these counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments are reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods due to changes in the value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. During 2010 and 2009, credit valuation gains (losses) of $731 million and $3.1 billion ($(8) million and $1.7 billion, net of hedges) were recognized in trading account profits (losses) for counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets. For additional information on gains or losses related to the counterparty credit risk on derivative assets, refer to Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on our monoline counterparty credit risk, see the discussions beginning on pages 47 and 90, and for information on our CDO-related counterparty credit risk, see GBAM beginning on page 45. Bank of America 2010 93 Table of Contents Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is provided by the Regional Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC. The following table sets forth total non-U.S. exposure broken out by region at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Non-U.S. exposure includes credit exposure net of local liabilities, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Total non-U.S. exposure can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Table 46 Regional Non-U.S. Exposure (1, 2, 3) December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Europe $ 148,078 $ 170,796 Asia Pacific 73,255 47,645 Latin America 14,848 19,516 Middle East and Africa 3,688 3,906 Other 22,188 15,799 Total $ 262,057 $ 257,662 (1) Local funding or liabilities are subtracted from local exposures consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. (2) Derivative assets included in the exposure amounts have been reduced by the amount of cash collateral applied of $44.2 billion and $34.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. (3) Generally, resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded from this presentation. Our total non-U.S. exposure was $262.1 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $4.4 billion from December 31, 2009. Our non-U.S. exposure remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for $148.1 billion, or 57 percent, of total non-U.S. exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries. The decrease of $22.7 billion in Europe was primarily driven by our efforts to reduce exposure in the peripheral Eurozone countries and sale or maturity of securities in the U.K. Select European countries are further detailed in Table 49. Asia Pacific was our second largest non-U.S. exposure at $73.3 billion, or 28 percent. The $25.6 billion increase in Asia Pacific was predominantly driven by a required change in accounting for our CCB investment, increased securities exposure in Japan, and increased securities and loan exposure in other Asia Pacific emerging markets. For more information on the required change in accounting for our CCB investment, refer to Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Latin America accounted for $14.8 billion, or six percent, of total non-U.S. exposure. The $4.7 billion decrease in Latin America was primarily driven by the sale of our equity investments in Ita Unibanco and Santander. Other non-U.S. exposure was $22.2 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.4 billion from the prior year resulting from an increase in Canadian cross-border loans. For more information on our Asia Pacific and Latin America exposure, see non-U.S. exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets on page 95. As shown in Table 47, the United Kingdom, France and China had total cross-border exposure greater than one percent of our total assets and were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, Canada and Japan had total cross-border exposure of $17.9 billion and $17.0 billion representing 0.79 percent and 0.75 percent of total assets. Canada and Japan were the only other countries that had total cross-border exposure that exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets at December 31, 2010. Exposure includes cross-border claims by our non-U.S. offices including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country Exposure Report.

Derivative assets were collateralized by other marketable securities of $96 million, $26 million and $71 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. (2) At December 31, 2009, total cross-border exposure for France and China was $17.4 billion and $12.1 billion, representing 0.78 percent and 0.54 percent of total assets. 94 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents As presented in Table 48, non-U.S. exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets increased $14.5 billion to $65.1 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $50.6 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was due to an increase in the Asia Pacific region which was partially offset by a decrease in Latin America. Non-U.S. exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented 25 percent and 20 percent of total non-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The definition that we use includes all countries in Asia Pacific excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand; all countries in Latin America excluding Cayman Islands and Bermuda; all countries in Middle East and Africa; and all countries in Central and Eastern Europe. At December 31, 2010, there was $460 million in emerging market exposure accounted for under the fair value option, none at December 31, 2009. (2) Includes acceptances, due froms, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. (3) Derivative assets are carried at fair value and have been reduced by the amount of cash collateral applied of $1.2 billion and $557 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were $408 million and $616 million of other marketable securities collateralizing derivative assets. (4) Generally, cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Cross-border resale agreements where the underlying securities are U.S. Treasury securities, in which case the domicile is the U.S., are excluded from this presentation. (5) Cross-border exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers or counterparties with a country of residence other than the one in which the credit is booked, regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated, consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. (6) Local country exposure includes amounts payable to the Corporation by borrowers with a country of residence in which the credit is booked regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated. Local funding or liabilities are subtracted from local exposures consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements. Total amount of available local liabilities funding local country exposure at December 31, 2010 was $15.7 billion compared to $17.6 billion at December 31, 2009. Local liabilities at December 31, 2010 in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa were $15.1 billion, $451 million and $193 million, respectively, of which $7.9 billion was in Singapore, $1.8 billion in both China and Hong Kong, $1.2 billion in India, $802 million in South Korea and $573 million in Taiwan. There were no other countries with available local liabilities funding local country exposure greater than $500 million. (7) No country included in Other Asia Pacific, Other Latin America, Other Middle East and Africa, and Other Central and Eastern Europe had total non-U.S. exposure of more than $500 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 70 percent and 53 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Asia Pacific. Emerging markets exposure in Asia Pacific increased by $18.3 billion primarily driven by our equity investment in CCB, which accounted for $10.6 billion, or 58 percent, of the increase in Asia, and increases in loans in India and securities in Singapore. The increase in our equity investment in CCB was driven by a required change in accounting. For more information on our CCB investment, refer to Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 21 percent and 35 percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Latin America. Latin America emerging markets exposure decreased $3.8 billion driven by the sale of our equity investments in Ita Unibanco and Santander, which accounted for $5.4 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2009, partially offset by increased loans across the region. For more information on these sales, refer to Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, six percent and seven percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and Africa, with a decrease of Bank of America 2010 95 Table of Contents $81 million primarily driven by a decrease in securities in South Africa, offset by increases in loans in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, and securities in Bahrain. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, three percent and five percent of the emerging markets exposure was in Central and Eastern Europe. Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, are currently experiencing varying degrees of financial stress. These countries have had certain credit ratings lowered by ratings services during 2010. Risks from the debt crisis in Europe could result in a disruption of the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. The table below shows our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, excluding consumer credit card exposure, in these countries at December 31, 2010. The total exposure to these countries was $15.8 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $25.5 billion at December 31, 2009. The $9.7 billion decrease since December 31, 2009 was driven primarily by the sale or maturity of sovereign and non-sovereign securities in all countries.

Of the $838 million applied for exposure reduction, $459 million was in Italy, $208 million in Ireland, $137 million in Spain and $34 million in Greece. (6) Represents net notional credit default protection purchased to hedge counterparty risk. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion to $28.4 billion for 2010 compared to 2009. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $11.4 billion to $25.4 billion for 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting lower delinquencies and decreasing bankruptcies in the consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios resulting from an improving economic outlook. Also contributing to the improvement were lower reserve additions in consumer real estate due to improving portfolio trends. The addition to reserves in the consumer PCI loan portfolios reflected further reductions in expected principal cash flows of $2.2 billion for 2010 compared to $3.5 billion a year earlier. Consumer net charge-offs of $29.4 billion for 2010 were $4.2 billion higher than the prior year due to the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain securitized loan balances in our consumer credit card and home equity portfolios, offset by benefits from economic improvement during the year which impacted all consumer portfolios. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including the provision for unfunded lending commitments, decreased $8.7 billion to $3.0 billion for 2010 compared to 2009 due to improved borrower credit profiles, stabilization of appraisal values in the commercial real estate portfolio and lower delinquencies and bankruptcies in the small business portfolio. These same factors resulted in a decrease in commercial net charge-offs of $3.5 billion to $5.0 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. 96 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on two components, described below, based on whether a loan or lease is performing or whether it has been individually identified as being impaired or has been modified as a TDR. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans held-for-sale and loans accounted for under the fair value option, as fair value adjustments related to loans measured at fair value include a credit risk component. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers nonperforming commercial loans, consumer real estate loans that have been modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business loans. These loans are subject to impairment measurement primarily at the loan level based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan original effective interest rate, or discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding renegotiated and promotionally priced loans for the renegotiated TDR portfolio. Impairment measurement may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan observable market price. When the determined or measured values are lower than the carrying value of the loan, impairment is recognized. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers performing consumer and commercial loans and leases which have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of our homogeneous loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. Included within this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single name defaults. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of these two components. As of December 31, 2010, inputs to the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for most consumer portfolios. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic or obligor concentrations within each portfolio segment, and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize the Corporation historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios are updated at least quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) based on the Corporation historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable; the industry in which the obligor operates; the obligor liquidity and other financial indicators; and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor credit risk. When estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, management relies not only on models derived from historical experience but also on its judgment in considering the effect on probable losses inherent in the portfolios due to the current macroeconomic environment and trends, inherent uncertainty in models, and other qualitative factors. As of December 31, 2010, updates to the loan risk ratings and composition resulted in reductions in the allowance for all commercial portfolios. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in Table 51 was $34.7 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.9 billion from December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily related to $10.8 billion of reserves recorded on January 1, 2010 in connection with the adoption of new consolidation guidance, and higher reserve additions in the non-impaired consumer real estate portfolios during the first half of 2010 amid continued stress in the housing market. These items were partially offset by reserve reductions primarily due to improving credit quality in the Global Card Services consumer portfolios. With respect to the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our expected principal cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves through provision of $2.2 billion for 2010, primarily in the home equity and discontinued real estate portfolios compared to $3.5 billion in 2009. The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was $7.2 billion at December 31, 2010, a $2.2 billion decrease from December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to improvements in the U.S. small business commercial portfolio within Global Card Services due to improved delinquencies and bankruptcies, as well as in the U.S. commercial portfolios primarily in Global Commercial Banking and GBAM, and the commercial real estate portfolio primarily within Global Commercial Banking reflecting improved borrower credit profiles as a result of improving economic conditions. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 4.47 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to 4.16 percent at December 31, 2009. The increase in the ratio was mostly due to consumer reserve increases for securitized loans consolidated under the new consolidation guidance, which were primarily credit card loans. The December 31, 2010 and 2009 ratios above include the impact of the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 3.94 percent at December 31, 2010 compared to 3.88 percent at December 31, 2009. Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of PD and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the Bank of America 2010 97 Table of Contents estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded exposure at default (EAD). The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the PD, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent uncertainty in models. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at December 31, 2010 was $1.2 billion, $299 million lower than December 31, 2009 primarily driven by accretion of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded positions and customer utilizations of previously unfunded positions.

Bank of America 2010 99 Table of Contents Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and other trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 22 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits. Mortgage Risk Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, other interest rates, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages, and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 25 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards and foreign currency-denominated debt. Equity Market Risk Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), over-the-counter equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. Commodity Risk Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. Issuer Credit Risk Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, credit default swaps and other credit fixed-income instruments. Market Liquidity Risk Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease to exist. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by the disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail below. Trading Risk Management Trading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 22 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary governance 100 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents authority for Global Markets Risk Management including trading risk management. The GRC focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting GBAM and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact lines of business outside of GBAM are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities. The GRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses. Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is provided to the GRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility. The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, as compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 90 percent of the trading days of which 75 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, four percent of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $102 million. This can be compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 88 percent of the trading days of which 72 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, six percent of the trading days had losses greater than $25 million and the largest loss was $100 million. Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit excesses are communicated to management for review. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence and depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are however many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Nevertheless, due to the limitations mentioned above, we have historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. The accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting (i.e., comparing actual results against expectations derived from historical data) the VaR results against the daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. In periods of market stress, the GRC members communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a result of this process, the lines of business may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure. Bank of America 2010 101 Table of Contents The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR in the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our VaR model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. Trading Risk and Return Daily Trading-related Revenue and VaR Table 52 presents average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2010 and 2009. Table 52 Trading Activities Market Risk VaR 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Average High (1) Low (1) Average High (1) Low (1) Foreign exchange $ 23.8 $ 73.1 $ 4.9 $ 20.3 $ 55.4 $ 6.1 Interest rate 64.1 128.3 33.2 73.7 136.7 43.6 Credit 171.5 287.2 122.9 183.3 338.7 123.9 Real estate/mortgage 83.1 138.5 42.9 51.1 81.3 32.4 Equities 39.4 90.9 20.8 44.6 87.6 23.6 Commodities 19.9 31.7 12.8 20.2 29.1 16.0 Portfolio diversification (200.5 ) (187.0 ) Total market-based trading portfolio $ 201.3 $ 375.2 $ 123.0 $ 206.2 $ 325.2 $ 117.9 (1) The high and low for the total portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred on different trading days. The decrease in average VaR during 2010 resulted from reduced exposures in several businesses. In addition, portfolio diversification increased relative to average VaR, as exposure changes resulted in reduced correlations across businesses. Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures reflecting the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our histogram or used for backtesting. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates, we also stress test our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a 10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks from predefined market stress events. These stress events include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition to the value afforded by the results themselves, this information provides senior management with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is also integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process has been established to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see page 68. 102 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading exposures. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. Interest rate risk from these activities, as well as the impact of changing market conditions, is managed through our ALM activities. Simulations are used to estimate the impact on core net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios, balance sheet trends and strategies. These simulations evaluate how changes in short-term financial instruments, debt securities, loans, deposits, borrowings and derivative instruments impact core net interest income. In addition, these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics. These simulations do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. Management analyzes core net interest income forecasts utilizing different rate scenarios with the baseline utilizing market-based forward interest rates. Management frequently updates the core net interest income forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and market conditions. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the static baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The spot and 12-month forward monthly rates used in our respective baseline forecast at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in the table below. Table 53 Forward Rates December 31 2010 2009 Federal Three-Month 10-Year Federal Three-Month 10-Year Funds LIBOR Swap Funds LIBOR Swap Spot rates 0.25 % 0.30 % 3.39 % 0.25 % 0.25 % 3.97 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.72 3.86 1.14 1.53 4.47 Table 54 shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income over the next twelve months from December 31, 2010 and 2009, resulting from a 100 bps gradual parallel increase, a 100 bps gradual parallel decrease, a 100 bps gradual curve flattening (increase in short-term rates or decrease in long-term rates) and a 100 bps gradual curve steepening (decrease in short-term rates or increase in long-term rates) from the forward market curve. For further discussion of core net interest income, see page 37.

The sensitivity analysis above assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated periods. At December 31, 2010, the exposure as reported reflects impacts that may be realized in net interest income. At December 31, 2009, the estimated exposure as reported reflects impacts that would have been realized primarily in net interest income and card income. Our core net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The change in the interest rate risk position relative to December 31, 2009 is primarily due to lower short-term interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. Securities The securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S. Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, AFS debt securities were $337.6 billion and $301.6 billion. During 2010 and 2009, we purchased AFS debt securities of $199.2 billion and $185.1 billion, sold $97.5 billion and $159.4 billion, and had maturities and received paydowns of $70.9 billion and $59.9 billion. We realized $2.5 billion and $4.7 billion in net gains on sales of debt securities during 2010 and 2009. In addition, we securitized $2.4 billion and $14.0 billion of residential mortgage loans into MBS during 2010 and 2009, which we retained. Bank of America 2010 103 Table of Contents During 2010, we entered into a series of transactions in our AFS debt securities portfolio that involved securitizations as well as sales of non-agency RMBS. These transactions were initiated following a review of corporate risk objectives in light of proposed Basel regulatory capital changes and liquidity targets. For more information on the proposed regulatory capital changes, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital Changes beginning on page 64. During 2010, the carrying value of the non-agency RMBS portfolio was reduced $14.5 billion primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales and securitizations as well as paydowns. We recognized net losses of $922 million on the series of transactions in the AFS debt securities portfolio, and improved the overall credit quality of the remaining portfolio such that the percentage of the non-agency RMBS portfolio that is below investment-grade was reduced significantly. Accumulated OCI includes after-tax net unrealized gains of $7.4 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, comprised primarily of after-tax net unrealized gains of $714 million and after-tax net unrealized losses of $628 million related to AFS debt securities and after-tax net unrealized gains of $6.7 billion and $2.1 billion related to AFS equity securities. The 2010 unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was related to our investment in CCB. See Note 5 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on marketable equity securities. Total market value of the AFS debt securities was $337.6 billion and $301.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009 with a weighted-average duration of 4.9 and 4.5 years, and primarily relates to our MBS and U.S. Treasury portfolio. The amount of pre-tax accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities increased by $2.2 billion during 2010 to $1.1 billion, primarily due to sales of non-agency CMO positions. We recognized $967 million of OTTI losses through earnings on AFS debt securities in 2010 compared to $2.8 billion in 2009. We also recognized $3 million of OTTI losses on AFS marketable equity securities during 2010 compared to $326 million in 2009. The recognition of impairment losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and the specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. We do not intend to sell securities with unrealized losses and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell those securities before recovery of amortized cost. Based on our evaluation of these and other relevant factors, and after consideration of the losses described in the paragraph above, we do not believe that the AFS debt and marketable equity securities that are in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2010 are other-than-temporarily impaired. Residential Mortgage Portfolio At December 31, 2010 and 2009, residential mortgages were $258.0 billion and $242.1 billion. During 2010 and 2009, we retained $63.8 billion and $26.6 billion in first mortgages originated by Home Loans & Insurance . Outstanding residential mortgage loans increased $15.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 as new FHA insured origination volume was partially offset by paydowns, the sale of $10.8 billion of residential mortgages related to First Republic Bank, transfers to foreclosed properties and charge-offs. In addition, FHA repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA also increased the residential mortgage portfolio during 2010. During 2010 and 2009, we securitized $2.4 billion and $14.0 billion of residential mortgage loans into MBS which we retained. We recognized gains of $68 million on securitizations completed during 2010. For more information on these securitizations, see Note 8 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2010 and 2009, we had no purchases of residential mortgages related to ALM activities. We sold $443 million of residential mortgages during 2010, of which $432 million were originated residential mortgages and $11 million were previously purchased from third parties. Net gains on these transactions were $21 million. This compares to sales of $5.9 billion of residential mortgages during 2009 of which $5.1 billion were originated residential mortgages and $771 million were previously purchased from third parties. These sales resulted in gains of $47 million. We received paydowns of $38.2 billion and $42.3 billion in 2010 and 2009. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Table 55 shows the notional amounts, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and estimated duration of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2010 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. The notional amount of our option positions increased to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2010 from $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Our interest rate swap positions, including foreign exchange contracts, were a net receive-fixed position of $6.4 billion and $52.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The decrease in the net notional levels of our interest rate swap position was driven by the net addition of $51.6 billion in pay-fixed swaps and $11.5 billion in foreign currency-denominated receive-fixed swaps, offset by a reduction of $5.6 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated receive-fixed swaps. The notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps was $235.2 billion and $122.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The $112.4 billion notional change was primarily due to new trade activity during 2010 to mitigate cross-currency basis risk on our economic hedge portfolio. The increase in pay-fixed swaps resulted from hedging newly purchased U.S. Treasury Bonds with swaps and entering into additional pay-fixed swaps to hedge variable rate short-term liabilities. Our futures and forwards net notional position, which reflects the net of long and short positions, was a short position of $280 million at December 31, 2010 compared to a long position of $10.6 billion at December 31, 2009. 104 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents The table below includes derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments. The fair value of net ALM contracts increased $329 million to a gain of $12.6 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $12.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in the value of U.S. dollar- denominated receive-fixed interest rate swaps of $3.3 billion, foreign exchange contracts of $2.1 billion and foreign exchange basis swaps of $197 million. The increase was partially offset by a loss from the changes in the value of pay-fixed interest rate swaps of $5.0 billion and option products of $294 million.

(2) Does not include basis adjustments on either fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation or AFS debt securities which are hedged in fair value hedge relationships using derivatives designated as hedging instruments that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (3) At December 31, 2010 and 2009, same-currency basis swaps consist of $152.8 billion and $42.9 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. (4) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps. (5) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation which substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives. (6) Option products of $6.6 billion at December 31, 2010 are comprised of $160 million in purchased caps/floors, $8.2 billion in swaptions and $(1.8) billion in foreign exchange options. Option products of $6.5 billion at December 31, 2009 are comprised of $177 million in purchased caps/floors and $6.3 billion in swaptions. (7) Foreign exchange contracts include foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed interest rate swaps as well as foreign currency forward rate contracts. Total notional amount was comprised of $57.6 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps and $52.0 billion in foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31, 2010, and $46.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps and $57.7 billion in foreign currency forward rate contracts at December 31, 2009. (8) Reflects the net of long and short positions. We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities, including certain compensation costs and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes to prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2010 the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.8 billion, or 35 percent within the next year, 80 percent within five years, and 92 percent within 10 years, with the remaining eight percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 4 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Bank of America 2010 105 Table of Contents We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax losses on derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at December 31, 2010. Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS was $129.0 billion and $161.4 billion. MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts, Eurodollar futures, as well as mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities as economic hedges of MSRs. The notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs at December 31, 2010 were $1.6 trillion and $60.3 billion. At December 31, 2009, the notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs were $1.3 trillion and $67.6 billion. In 2010, we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $5.0 billion related to the change in fair value of these economic hedges compared to losses of $3.8 billion for 2009. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 25 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see Home Loans & Insurance beginning on page 41. Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk posed by the failure to manage regulatory, legal and ethical issues that could result in monetary damages, losses or harm to our reputation or image. The Seven Elements of a Compliance Program provides the framework for the compliance programs that are consistently applied across the Corporation to manage compliance risk. This framework includes a common approach to commitment and accountability, policies and procedures, controls and supervision, monitoring and testing, regulatory change management, education and awareness, and reporting. We approach compliance risk management on an enterprise and line of business level. The Operational and Compliance Risk Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Operational Risk Committee, provides oversight of significant compliance risk issues. Within Global Risk Management, Global Compliance Risk Management develops and implements the strategies, policies and practices for assessing and managing compliance risks across the organization. Through education and communication efforts, a culture of compliance is emphasized across the organization. The lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including compliance risks. Compliance risk executives monitor and test business processes for compliance and escalate risks and issues needing resolution. Operational Risk Management The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions, and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Global banking guidelines and country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were established in a set of rules known as Basel II. Basel II requires banks have internal operational risk management processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures. Under the Basel II Rules, an operational loss event is an event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event categories: internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing errors and physical losses from natural disasters. We approach operational risk management from two perspectives: (1) at the enterprise level and (2) at the line of business and enterprise control function levels. The enterprise level refers to risk across all of the Corporation. The line of business level includes risk in all of the revenue producing businesses. Enterprise control functions refer to the business units that support the Corporation business operations. The Operational Risk Committee oversees and approves the Corporation policies and processes to assure sound operational and compliance risk management and serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk and compliance matters within the Corporation. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board regarding operational risk activities. Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization as well reporting results to governance committees and the Board. The lines of business and enterprise control functions are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools like loss reporting, scenario analysis and risk and control self-assessments, operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior line of business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each line of business and enterprise control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business recovery planning and new product introduction processes. The lines of business and enterprise control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices. Line of business and enterprise control function management uses the enterprise risk and control self-assessment process to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control 106 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of this process is to assess changing market and business conditions, to evaluate key risks impacting each line of business and enterprise control function and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. The risk and control self assessment process is documented at periodic intervals. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on an enterprise, line of business and enterprise control function level. The enterprise control functions participate in two ways to the operational risk management process. First, these organizations manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide specialized risk management services within their area of expertise to the enterprise and the lines of business and other enterprise control functions they support. For example, the Enterprise Information Management and Supply Chain Management organizations in the Technology and Operations enterprise control function, develop risk management practices, such as information security and supplier management programs. These groups also work with business and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each line of business and enterprise control function relative to these programs. Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses when and if they occur. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies are subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that, with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact net income. Separate from the possible future impact to net income from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries, and borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions. Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our home loans, and credit card and other consumer portfolio segments. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our home loans portfolio segment excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2010 would have increased by $141 million. PCI loans within our home loans portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected principal cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one percent decrease in the expected principal cash flows could result in a $297 million impairment of the portfolio, of which $138 million would be related to our discontinued real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our credit card and other consumer portfolio segment coupled with a one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2010 would have increased by $152 million. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within our Commercial portfolio segment. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by $6.7 billion at December 31, 2010. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2010 was 4.47 percent and this hypothetical increase in the allowance would raise the ratio to 5.19 percent. These sensitivity analyses do not represent management expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote. The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. Bank of America 2010 107 Table of Contents Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income. Commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method (i.e., lower of cost or market) with impairment recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income. At December 31, 2010, our total MSR balance was $15.2 billion. We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the option-adjusted spread (OAS) levels. These variables can, and generally do change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our consumer MSRs by 10 percent while keeping all other assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated increase of $907 million in mortgage banking income at December 31, 2010. This impact provided above does not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk. We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations, securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income. For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 106. For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions, see Note 25 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, for information on the impact of the time to complete foreclosure sales on the value of MSRs, see Recent Events Certain Servicing-related Issues beginning on page 34. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, certain MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 22 Fair Value Measurements and Note 23 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair values of assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific factors, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered by the knowledge of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more of the ratings agencies. Trading account profits (losses), which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits (losses) are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. For more information on VaR, see Trading Risk Management beginning on page 100. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives the net credit differential between the counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk. The value of the credit differential is determined by reference to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where direct references are not available, a proxy is applied consistent with direct references for other counterparties that are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the 108 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents determination of fair value, primarily based on historical experience adjusted for any more recent name specific expectations. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include private equity investments, consumer MSRs, ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, structured notes and certain CDOs, for which there is not an active market for identical assets from which to determine fair value or where sufficient, current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs into a valuation model is not available. In these cases, the fair values of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, a net asset value approach for certain structured securities, or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. In 2010, there were no changes to the quantitative models, or uses of such models, that resulted in a material adjustment to the Consolidated Statement of Income.

During 2010, we recognized net gains of $7.1 billion on Level 3 assets and liabilities which were primarily gains on net derivatives driven by income earned on IRLCs, which are considered derivative instruments related to the origination of mortgage loans that are held-for-sale. These gains were partially offset by changes in the value of MSRs as a result of a decline in interest rates and OTTI losses on non-agency RMBS. We also recorded pre-tax net unrealized losses of $193 million in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities during 2010, primarily related to non-agency RMBS. Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be economically hedged with derivatives not classified as Level 3; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are effective as of the beginning of the quarter. During 2010, the more significant transfers into Level 3 included $3.2 billion of trading account assets, $3.5 billion of AFS debt securities, $1.1 billion of net derivative contracts and $1.9 billion of long-term debt. Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by reduced price transparency as a result of lower levels of trading activity for certain municipal auction rate securities and corporate debt securities as well as a change in valuation methodology for certain ABS to a discounted cash flow model. Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were due to an increase in the number of non-agency RMBS and other taxable securities priced using a discounted cash flow model. Transfers into Level 3 for net derivative contracts were primarily related to a lack of price observability for certain credit default and total return swaps. Transfers in and transfers out of Level 3 for long-term debt are primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain equity-linked structured notes. During 2010, the more significant transfers out of Level 3 were $3.4 billion of trading account assets and $1.8 billion of long-term debt. Transfers out of Level 3 for trading account assets were driven by increased price verification of certain mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt and non-U.S. government and agency securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for long-term debt are the result of a decrease in the significance of unobservable pricing inputs for certain equity-linked structured notes. Global Principal Investments Global Principal Investments is included within Equity Investments in All Other on page 51. Global Principal Investments is comprised of a diversified portfolio of private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. At December 31, 2010, this portfolio totaled $11.7 billion including $9.7 billion of non-public investments. Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to investment-company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, Bank of America 2010 109 Table of Contents are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our proportionate interest in the fund capital as reported by the fund respective managers. Accrued Income Taxes Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represents the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance , in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Background The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is performed as of June 30 and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. See discussion about the annual impairment test as of June 30, 2010 on page 111. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill. The Corporation common stock price, consistent with common stock prices in the financial services industry, remains volatile primarily due to the continued uncertainty in the financial markets as well as recent financial reforms including the Financial Reform Act. Our market capitalization has remained below our recorded book value during 2010. The fair value of all reporting units in aggregate as of the June 30, 2010 annual impairment test was estimated to be $264.4 billion and the common stock market capitalization of the Corporation as of that date was $144.2 billion ($134.5 billion at December 31, 2010). The implied control premium, which is the amount a buyer would be willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded stock to obtain control, was 63 percent after taking into consideration the outstanding preferred stock of $18.0 billion as of June 30, 2010. As none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations are not directly correlated to the Corporation stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that recent fluctuations in our market capitalization as a result of the current economic conditions are reflective of actual cash flows and the fair value of our individual reporting units. Estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets, liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and included the use of independent valuation specialists. Measurement of the fair values of the assets, liabilities and intangibles of a reporting unit was consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting guidance and includes the use of estimates and judgments. The fair values of the intangible assets were determined using the income approach. The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly traded companies in industries similar to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based upon qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the respective reporting unit compared to the comparable publicly traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, a control premium was added to arrive at the reporting units estimated fair values on a controlling basis. For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows using estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. Expected rates of equity returns were estimated based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Global Card Services Impairment On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. Under the Financial Reform Act and its amendment to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Federal Reserve must adopt rules within nine months of enactment of the Financial Reform Act regarding the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to electronic debit transactions. Those rules will take effect one year after enactment of the Financial Reform Act. The Financial Reform Act and the applicable rules are expected to materially reduce the future revenues generated by the debit card business of the Corporation. Our consumer and small business card products, including the debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within Global Card Services . During the three months ended September 30, 2010, our estimate of revenue loss due to the debit card interchange fee standards to be adopted under the Financial Reform Act was approximately $2.0 billion annually based on current volumes. Accordingly, we performed an impairment test for Global Card Services during the three months ended September 30, 2010. In step one of the impairment test, the fair value of Global Card Services was estimated under the income approach where the significant assumptions included the 110 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents discount rate, terminal value, expected loss rates and expected new account growth. We also updated our estimated cash flow valuation to reflect the current strategic plan and other portfolio assumptions. Based on the results of step one of the impairment test, we determined that the carrying amount of Global Card Services , including goodwill, exceeded the fair value. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill of the reporting unit were $39.2 billion, $25.9 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively. Accordingly, we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. In step two, we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Under step two of the impairment test, significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the current economic conditions. Based on the results of this third-quarter goodwill impairment test for Global Card Services , the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value by $10.4 billion. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in Global Card Services from $22.3 billion to $11.9 billion. The goodwill impairment test included limited mitigation actions to recapture lost revenue. Although we have identified other potential mitigation actions within Global Card Services , the impact of these actions going forward did not reduce the goodwill impairment charge because these actions are in the early stages of development and, additionally, certain of them may impact segments other than Global Card Services (e.g ., Deposits ). The impairment charge had no impact on the Corporation reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. Due to the continued stress on Global Card Services as a result of the Financial Reform Act, we concluded that an additional impairment analysis should be performed for this reporting unit during the three months ended December 31, 2010. In step one of the goodwill impairment test, the fair value of Global Card Services was estimated under the income approach. The significant assumptions under the income approach included the discount rate, terminal value, expected loss rates and expected new account growth. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill for the Global Card Services reporting unit were $27.5 billion, $27.6 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value as a percent of the carrying amount at December 31, 2010 was 100 percent. Although fair value exceeded the carrying amount in step one of the Global Card Services goodwill impairment test, to further substantiate the value of goodwill, we also performed the step two test for this reporting unit. Under step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit, significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the current economic conditions. The results of step two of the goodwill impairment test indicated that remaining balance of goodwill of $11.9 billion was not impaired as of December 31, 2010. On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed regulations to implement the Durbin Amendment of the Financial Reform Act, which are scheduled to be effective July 21, 2011. The proposed rule includes two alternative interchange fee standards that would apply to all covered issuers: one based on each issuer costs, with a safe harbor initially set at $0.07 per transaction and a cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction; and the other a stand-alone cap initially set at $0.12 per transaction. See Regulatory Matters beginning on page 56 for additional information. Although the range of revenue loss estimate based on the proposed rule was slightly higher than our original estimate of $2.0 billion, given the uncertainty around the potential outcome, we did not change the revenue loss estimate used in the goodwill impairment test during the three months ended December 31, 2010. If the final Federal Reserve rule sets interchange fee standards that are significantly lower than the interchange fee assumptions we used in this goodwill impairment test, we will be required to perform an additional goodwill impairment test which may result in additional impairment of goodwill in Global Card Services. In view of the uncertainty with model inputs including the final ruling, changes in the economic outlook and the corresponding impact to revenues and asset quality, and the impacts of mitigation actions, it is not possible to estimate the amount or range of amounts of additional goodwill impairment, if any. Home Loans & Insurance Impairment During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we performed an impairment test for the Home Loans & Insurance reporting unit as it was likely that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of increased uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation exposure and other related risks, higher current servicing costs including loss mitigation efforts, foreclosure related issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources to address servicing needs. In step one of the goodwill impairment test, the fair value of Home Loans & Insurance was estimated based on a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach valuation, significant assumptions included market multiples and a control premium. The significant assumptions for the valuation of Home Loans & Insurance under the income approach included cash flow estimates, the discount rate and the terminal value. These assumptions were updated to reflect the current strategic plan forecast and to address the increased uncertainties referenced above. Based on the results of step one of the impairment test , we determined that the carrying amount of Home Loans & Insurance , including goodwill, exceeded the fair value. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill for the Home Loans & Insurance reporting unit were $24.7 billion, $15.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Accordingly, we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. In step two, we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Under step two of the goodwill impairment test, significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the current economic conditions. Based on the results of step two of the impairment test, the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to Home Loans & Insurance exceeded the implied fair value by $2.0 billion. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the Home Loans & Insurance reporting unit. The impairment charge had no impact on the Corporation Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. As we obtain additional information relative to our litigation exposure, representations and warranties repurchase obligations, servicing costs and foreclosure related issues, it is possible that such information, if significantly different than the assumptions used in this goodwill impairment test, may result in additional impairment in the Home Loans & Insurance reporting unit. Annual Impairment Test for 2010 We perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units as of June 30 each year. In performing the first step of the June 30, 2010 annual impairment test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying amount, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of a market approach and an income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of publicly traded companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premiums used in the June 30, 2010 annual impairment test ranged from 25 to 35 percent. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2010 annual impairment test ranged from 11 to 15 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Because growth rates developed by management for Bank of America 2010 111 Table of Contents individual revenue and expense items have been significantly affected by the current economic environment and financial reform, management developed separate long-term forecasts. The fair value of Global Card Services was estimated under the income approach which did not include the impact of any potential future changes that would result from the Financial Reform Act because it was not signed into law until the third quarter 2010. Based on the results of step one of the annual impairment test, we determined that the carrying amount of the Home Loans & Insurance and Global Card Services reporting units, including goodwill, exceeded their fair value. The carrying amount, fair value and goodwill for the Home Loans & Insurance reporting unit were $27.1 billion, $22.5 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and for Global Card Services were $40.1 billion, $40.1 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively. Because the carrying amount exceeded the fair value, we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for these reporting units as of June 30, 2010. For all other reporting units, step two was not required as their fair value exceeded their carrying amount indicating there was no impairment. In step two for both reporting units, we compared the implied fair value of each reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We determined the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Significant assumptions in measuring the fair value of the assets and liabilities of both reporting units including discount rates, loss rates and interest rates were updated to reflect the current economic conditions. Based on the results of step two of the impairment test as of June 30, 2010, we determined that goodwill was not impaired in either Home Loans & Insurance or Global Card Services . Representations and Warranties The methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors, which include depending upon the counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, estimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability. Representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. For those claims where we have established a representations and warranties liability as discussed in Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements, an assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately $850 million or decrease of approximately $950 million in the representations and warranties liability as of December 31, 2010. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Representations and Warranties on page 52, Note 9 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Litigation Reserve In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. For a limited number of the matters disclosed in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation maximum loss exposure. Information is provided in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest Entities The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. In accordance with the new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 112 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and implicit contractual arrangements, and the entity involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. The entity must then determine which activities have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that services the assets or makes investment management decisions may have the power to direct the most significant activities of a VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are no significant ongoing activities, the party that was responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees. On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements. 2009 Compared to 2008 The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for 2009 and 2008. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables 6 and 7 contain financial data to supplement this discussion. Overview Net Income Net income totaled $6.3 billion in 2009 compared to $4.0 billion in 2008. Including preferred stock dividends, net loss applicable to common shareholders was $2.2 billion, or $(0.29) per diluted share. Those results compared with 2008 net income available to common shareholders of $2.6 billion, or $0.54 per diluted share. Net Interest Income Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.9 billion to $48.4 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was driven by the improved rate environment, the acquisitions of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, the impact of new draws on previously securitized accounts and the contribution from market-based net interest income which benefited from the Merrill Lynch acquisition. These items were partially offset by the impact of deleveraging the ALM portfolio earlier in 2009, lower consumer loan levels and the adverse impact of nonperforming loans. The net interest yield on a FTE basis decreased 33 bps to 2.65 percent for 2009 compared to 2008 due to the factors related to the core businesses as described above. Noninterest Income Noninterest income increased $45.1 billion to $72.5 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. Card income on a held basis decreased $5.0 billion primarily due to higher credit losses on securitized credit card loans and lower fee income driven by changes in consumer retail purchase and payment behavior in the stressed economic environment. Investment and brokerage services increased $6.9 billion primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch partially offset by the impact of lower valuations in the equity markets driven by the market downturn in late 2008, which improved modestly in 2009, and net outflows in the cash funds. Investment banking income increased $3.3 billion due to higher debt, equity and advisory fees reflecting the increased size of the investment banking platform from the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Equity investment income increased $9.5 billion driven by $7.3 billion in gains on sales of portions of our CCB investment and a $1.1 billion gain related to our BlackRock investment. Trading account profits (losses) increased $18.1 billion primarily driven by favorable core trading results and reduced write-downs on legacy assets partially offset by negative credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities of $662 million due to improvement in the Corporation credit spreads. Mortgage banking income increased $4.7 billion driven by higher production and servicing income of $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion. These increases were primarily due to increased volume as a result of the full-year impact of Countrywide and higher refinance activity partially offset by lower MSR results, net of hedges. Gains on sales of debt securities increased $3.6 billion due to the favorable interest rate environment and improved credit spreads. Gains were primarily driven by sales of agency MBS and CMOs. The net loss in other decreased $1.6 billion primarily due to the $3.8 billion gain from the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture, reduced support provided to cash funds and lower write-downs on legacy assets offset by negative credit valuation adjustments recorded on Merrill Lynch structured notes of $4.9 billion. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $21.7 billion to $48.6 billion for 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting further deterioration in the economy and housing markets across a broad range of property types, industries and borrowers. Net charge-offs totaled $33.7 billion, or 3.58 percent of average loans and leases for 2009 compared with $16.2 billion, or 1.79 percent for 2008. The increased level of net charge-offs is a result of the same factors noted above. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense increased $25.2 billion to $66.7 billion for 2009 compared to 2008. Personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose due to the addition of Merrill Lynch and the full-year impact of Countrywide. Additionally, noninterest expense increased due to higher litigation costs compared to the prior year, a $425 million pre-tax charge to pay the U.S. government to terminate its asset guarantee term sheet and higher FDIC insurance costs including a $724 million special assessment in 2009. Income Tax Expense Income tax benefit was $1.9 billion for 2009 compared to expense of $420 million for 2008 and resulted in an effective tax rate of (44.0) percent compared to 9.5 percent in the prior year. The change in the effective tax rate from the prior year was due to increased permanent tax preference items as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch. Bank of America 2010 113 Table of Contents Business Segment Operations Deposits Net income decreased $3.0 billion to $2.6 billion driven by lower net revenue partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $3.8 billion driven by lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities and spread compression as interest rates declined. Noninterest income was essentially flat at $6.8 billion. Noninterest expense increased $908 million to $9.5 billion primarily due to higher FDIC insurance including a special FDIC assessment, partially offset by lower operating costs related to lower transaction volume due to the economy and productivity initiatives. Global Card Services Net income decreased $6.8 billion to a net loss of $5.3 billion due to higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income grew $667 million to $20.0 billion driven by increased loan spreads. Noninterest income decreased $2.6 billion to $9.1 billion driven by decreases in card income and all other income. The decrease in card income resulted from lower cash advances, credit card interchange and fee income. All other income in 2008 included the gain associated with the Visa initial public offering (IPO). Provision for credit losses increased $10.0 billion to $29.6 billion primarily driven by higher losses in the consumer card and consumer lending portfolios from impact of the economic conditions. Noninterest expense decreased $1.2 billion to $7.7 billion primarily due to lower operating and marketing costs, and the impact of certain benefits associated with the Visa IPO transactions. Home Loans & Insurance Home Loans & Insurance net loss increased $1.3 billion to a net loss of $3.9 billion as growth in noninterest income and net interest income was more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income grew $1.7 billion driven primarily by an increase in average LHFS and home equity loans. The growth in average LHFS was a result of higher mortgage loan volume driven by the lower interest rate environment. The growth in average home equity loans was attributable to the migration of certain loans from GWIM to Home Loans & Insurance as well as the Countrywide acquisition. Noninterest income increased $5.9 billion to $11.9 billion driven by higher mortgage banking income which benefited from the Countrywide acquisition and higher production income, partially offset by higher representations and warranties provision. Provision for credit losses increased $5.0 billion to $11.2 billion driven primarily by higher losses in the home equity portfolio and reserve increases in the Countrywide home equity PCI portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $4.7 billion to $11.7 billion primarily driven by the Countrywide acquisition as well as increased costs related to higher production volume. Global Commercial Banking Net income decreased $2.9 billion to a net loss of $290 million in 2009 as an increase in revenue was more than offset by increased credit costs. Net interest income was essentially flat at $8.1 billion. Noninterest income increased $552 million to $3.1 billion largely driven by our agreement to purchase certain retail automotive loans. The provision for credit losses increased $4.5 billion to $7.8 billion, driven by reserve additions primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio and higher net charge-offs across all portfolios. Noninterest expense increased $501 million primarily attributable to higher FDIC insurance, including a special FDIC assessment. Global Banking & Markets Global Banking & Markets recognized net income of $10.1 billion in 2009 compared to a net loss of $3.2 billion in 2008 as increased noninterest income driven by trading account profits was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Sales and trading revenue was $17.6 billion in 2009 compared to a loss of $6.9 billion in 2008 primarily due to the addition of Merrill Lynch. Noninterest income also included a $3.8 billion pre-tax gain related to the contribution of the merchant processing business into a joint venture. Noninterest expense increased $8.6 billion, largely attributable to the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Global Wealth & Investment Management Net income increased $702 million to $1.7 billion in 2009 as higher total revenue was partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $1.2 billion to $6.0 billion primarily due to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Noninterest income increased $8.6 billion to $10.1 billion primarily due to higher investment and brokerage services income and the lower level of support provided to certain cash funds, partially offset by the impact of lower average equity market levels and net outflows primarily in the cash complex. Provision for credit losses increased $397 million to $1.1 billion, reflecting the weak economy during 2009 which drove higher net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios. Noninterest expense increased $8.3 billion to $12.4 billion driven by the addition of Merrill Lynch and higher FDIC insurance, including a special FDIC assessment, partially offset by lower revenue-related expenses. All Other Net income in All Other was $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to a net loss of $1.1 billion in 2008 as higher total revenue driven by increases in noninterest income, net interest income and an income tax benefit were partially offset by increased provision for credit losses, merger and restructuring charges and all other noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.5 billion primarily due to unallocated net interest income related to increased liquidity driven in part by capital raises during 2009. Noninterest income increased $8.2 billion to $10.6 billion driven by higher equity investment income including a $7.3 billion gain on the sale of a portion of our CCB investment and gains on sales of debt securities. These were partially offset by a $4.9 billion negative valuation adjustment on certain structured liabilities. Provision for credit losses was $8.0 billion in 2009 compared to $2.8 billion in 2008 primarily due to higher credit costs related to our ALM residential mortgage portfolio. Merger and restructuring charges increased $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion due to the integration costs associated with the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions. 114 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents Statistical Tables Table I Year-to-date Average Balances and Interest Rates FTE Basis 2010 2009 2008 Interest Interest Interest Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/ (Dollars in millions) Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Earning assets Time deposits placed and other short-term investments (1) $ 27,419 $ 292 1.06 % $ 27,465 $ 334 1.22 % $ 10,696 $ 367 3.43 % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 256,943 1,832 0.71 235,764 2,894 1.23 128,053 3,313 2.59 Trading account assets 213,745 7,050 3.30 217,048 8,236 3.79 186,579 9,259 4.96 Debt securities (2) 323,946 11,850 3.66 271,048 13,224 4.88 250,551 13,383 5.34 Loans and leases (3) : Residential mortgage (4) 245,727 11,736 4.78 249,335 13,535 5.43 260,244 14,657 5.63 Home equity 145,860 5,990 4.11 154,761 6,736 4.35 135,060 7,606 5.63 Discontinued real estate 13,830 527 3.81 17,340 1,082 6.24 10,898 858 7.87 U.S. credit card 117,962 12,644 10.72 52,378 5,666 10.82 63,318 6,843 10.81 Non-U.S. credit card 28,011 3,450 12.32 19,655 2,122 10.80 16,527 2,042 12.36 Direct/Indirect consumer (5) 96,649 4,753 4.92 99,993 6,016 6.02 82,516 6,934 8.40 Other consumer (6) 2,927 186 6.34 3,303 237 7.17 3,816 321 8.41 Total consumer 650,966 39,286 6.04 596,765 35,394 5.93 572,379 39,261 6.86 U.S. commercial 195,895 7,909 4.04 223,813 8,883 3.97 220,554 11,702 5.31 Commercial real estate (7) 59,947 2,000 3.34 73,349 2,372 3.23 63,208 3,057 4.84 Commercial lease financing 21,427 1,070 4.99 21,979 990 4.51 22,290 799 3.58 Non-U.S. commercial 30,096 1,091 3.62 32,899 1,406 4.27 32,440 1,503 4.63 Total commercial 307,365 12,070 3.93 352,040 13,651 3.88 338,492 17,061 5.04 Total loans and leases 958,331 51,356 5.36 948,805 49,045 5.17 910,871 56,322 6.18 Other earning assets 117,189 3,919 3.34 130,063 5,105 3.92 75,972 4,161 5.48 Total earning assets (8) 1,897,573 76,299 4.02 1,830,193 78,838 4.31 1,562,722 86,805 5.55 Cash and cash equivalents (1) 174,621 368 196,237 379 45,367 73 Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses 367,408 416,638 235,896 Total assets $ 2,439,602 $ 2,443,068 $ 1,843,985 Interest-bearing liabilities U.S. interest-bearing deposits: Savings $ 36,649 $ 157 0.43 % $ 33,671 $ 215 0.64 % $ 32,204 $ 230 0.71 % NOW and money market deposit accounts 441,589 1,405 0.32 358,712 1,557 0.43 267,831 3,781 1.41 Consumer CDs and IRAs 142,648 1,723 1.21 218,041 5,054 2.32 203,887 7,404 3.63 Negotiable CDs, public funds and other time deposits 17,683 226 1.28 37,796 473 1.25 32,264 1,076 3.33 Total U.S. interest-bearing deposits 638,569 3,511 0.55 648,220 7,299 1.13 536,186 12,491 2.33 Non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits: Banks located in non-U.S. countries 18,102 144 0.80 18,688 145 0.78 37,354 1,056 2.83 Governments and official institutions 3,349 10 0.28 6,270 16 0.26 10,975 279 2.54 Time, savings and other 55,059 332 0.60 57,045 347 0.61 53,695 1,424 2.65 Total non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits 76,510 486 0.64 82,003 508 0.62 102,024 2,759 2.70 Total interest-bearing deposits 715,079 3,997 0.56 730,223 7,807 1.07 638,210 15,250 2.39 Federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings 430,329 3,699 0.86 488,644 5,512 1.13 455,703 12,362 2.71 Trading account liabilities 91,669 2,571 2.80 72,207 2,075 2.87 72,915 2,774 3.80 Long-term debt 490,497 13,707 2.79 446,634 15,413 3.45 231,235 9,938 4.30 Total interest-bearing liabilities (8) 1,727,574 23,974 1.39 1,737,708 30,807 1.77 1,398,063 40,324 2.88 Noninterest-bearing sources: Noninterest-bearing deposits 273,507 250,743 192,947 Other liabilities 205,290 209,972 88,144 Shareholders equity 233,231 244,645 164,831 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 2,439,602 $ 2,443,068 $ 1,843,985 Net interest spread 2.63 % 2.54 % 2.67 % Impact of noninterest-bearing sources 0.13 0.08 0.30 Net interest income/yield on earning assets (1) $ 52,325 2.76 % $ 48,031 2.62 % $ 46,481 2.97 % (1) Fees earned on overnight deposits placed with the Federal Reserve, which were included in time deposits placed and other short-term investments in prior periods, have been reclassified to cash and cash equivalents, consistent with the Corporation Consolidated Balance Sheet presentation of these deposits. Net interest income and net interest yield are calculated excluding these fees. (2) Yields on AFS debt securities are calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis. The use of fair value does not have a material impact on net interest yield. (3) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances. Income on these nonperforming loans is recognized on a cash basis. Purchased credit-impaired loans were written down to fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loan. (4) Includes non-U.S. residential mortgage loans of $410 million and $622 million in 2010 and 2009. There were no material non-U.S. residential mortgage loans prior to January 1, 2009. (5) Includes non-U.S. consumer loans of $7.9 billion, $8.0 billion and $2.7 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (6) Includes consumer finance loans of $2.1 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion; other non-U.S. consumer loans of $731 million, $657 million and $774 million; and consumer overdrafts of $111 million, $217 million and $247 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (7) Includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $57.3 billion, $70.7 billion and $62.1 billion; and non-U.S. commercial real estate loans of $2.7 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (8) Interest income includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest income on the underlying assets $1.4 billion, $456 million and $260 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Bank of America 2010 131 Table of Contents Glossary Alt-A Mortgage Alternative-A mortgage, a type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or prime, and less risky than subprime, the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime home loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. Assets in Custody Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net-worth and retail clients and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. Bridge Financing A loan or security that is expected to be replaced by permanent financing (debt or equity securities, loan syndication or asset sales) prior to the maturity date of the loan. Bridge loans may include an unfunded commitment, as well as funded amounts, and are generally expected to be retired in one year or less. Client Brokerage Assets Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Client Deposits Includes GWIM client deposit accounts representing both consumer and commercial demand, regular savings, time, money market, sweep and non-U.S. accounts. Committed Credit Exposure Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Core Net Interest Income Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis excluding the impact of market-based activities. Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) Legislation signed into law on May 22, 2009 to provide changes to credit card industry practices including significantly restricting credit card issuers ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, change the way payments are applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. The majority of the provisions became effective in February 2010. Credit Default Swap (CDS) A derivative contract that provides protection against the deterioration of credit quality and allows one party to receive payment in the event of default by a third party under a borrowing arrangement. Excess Servicing Income For certain assets that have been securitized, interest income, fee revenue and recoveries in excess of interest paid to the investors, gross credit losses and other trust expenses related to the securitized receivables are all classified as excess servicing income, which is a component of card income. Excess servicing income also includes the changes in fair value of the Corporation card-related retained interests. Interest-only Strip A residual interest in a securitization trust representing the right to receive future net cash flows from securitized assets after payments to third-party investors and net credit losses. These arise when assets are transferred to a SPE as part of an asset securitization transaction qualifying for sale treatment under GAAP. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. Letter of Credit A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are primarily determined by utilizing the Case-Schiller Home Index, a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. Case-Schiller indices are updated quarterly and are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Under certain circumstances, estimated values can also be determined by utilizing an automated valuation method (AVM) or Mortgage Risk Assessment Corporation (MRAC) index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. The MRAC index is similar to the Case-Schiller Home Index in that it is an index that is based on data from repeat sales of single family homes and is reported on a lag. Making Home Affordable Program (MHA) A U.S. Treasury program to reduce the number of foreclosures and make it easier for homeowners to refinance loans. The program is comprised of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which provides guidelines on loan modifications and is designed to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure by reducing monthly mortgage payments and provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the program guidelines and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which is available to homeowners who have a proven payment history on an existing mortgage owned by FNMA or FHLMC and is designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage loans to take advantage of current lower mortgage rates or to refinance ARMs into more stable fixed-rate mortgages. In addition, the Second Lien Program is a part of the MHA. For more information on this program, see the separate definition for the Second Lien Program. Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (troubled debt restructurings or TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, purchased credit-impaired loans and loans held-for-sale are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans not secured by real estate, and consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon 132 Bank of America 2010 Table of Contents acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are written down to fair value at the acquisition date. Second Lien Program (2MP) A MHA program announced on April 28, 2009 by the U.S. Treasury that focuses on creating a comprehensive affordability solution for homeowners. By focusing on shared efforts with lenders to reduce second mortgage payments, pay-for-success incentives for servicers, investors and borrowers, and a payment schedule for extinguishing second mortgages, the 2MP is designed to help up to 1.5 million homeowners. The program is designed to ensure that first and second lien holders are treated fairly and consistently with priority of liens, and offers automatic modification of a second lien when a first lien is modified. Subprime Loans Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Super Senior CDO Exposure Represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities, including AAA-rated securities, issued by CDO vehicles. Tier 1 Common Capital Tier 1 capital including CES, less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) A program established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 by the U.S. Treasury to, among other things, invest in financial institutions through capital infusions and purchase mortgages, MBS and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions, in an aggregate amount up to $700 billion, for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives. Value-at-Risk (VaR) A VaR model estimates a range of hypothetical scenarios to calculate a potential loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level. VaR is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk.
