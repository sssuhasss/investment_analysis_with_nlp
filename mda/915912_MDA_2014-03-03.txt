ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help provide an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements" included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements" as well as the risk factors described in Item 1a, "Risk Factors," of this report. Capitalized terms have the meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Executive Overview Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the United States. We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments, because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. Barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. Our strategy is to be leaders in market research and capital allocation, delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best-performing submarkets of the United States. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are primarily located in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and the Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Financial Highlights For the year ended December 31, 2013, net income attributable to common stockholders was $353,141,000 compared to $423,869,000 for 2012, a decrease of 16.7%. The decrease is attributable primarily to an increase in depreciation expense and expensed transaction costs associated with the Archstone Acquisition, coupled with the recognition of a loss associated with an interest rate protection agreement. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in NOI from our communities. For the year ended December 31, 2013, Established Communities NOI increased by $26,147,000, or 4.7%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 4.3%, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 3.5% over 2012. 47 Table of Contents On February 27, 2013, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated November 26, 2012, by and among us, Equity Residential, Lehman, and Archstone, we, together with Equity Residential, acquired, directly or indirectly, all of Archstone's assets, including all of the ownership interests in joint ventures and other entities owned by Archstone, and assumed Archstone's liabilities, with certain limited exceptions. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we acquired approximately 40% of Archstone's assets and liabilities and Equity Residential acquired approximately 60% of Archstone's assets and liabilities. We acquired the following: 54 operating apartment communities that were consolidated for financial reporting purposes, containing 18,423 apartment homes, of which four communities containing 1,368 apartment homes were subsequently disposed of during 2013; six communities that were under construction and/or in lease-up, of which two have been completed with 553 homes and the other four of which are expected to be completed during 2014 and contain 1,114 apartment homes; six parcels of land, one of which we sold to the AC JV, which is currently being developed; options to acquire two additional parcels of land, of which one was acquired in 2013 and will begin construction in 2014; interests in unconsolidated joint ventures in which we are the general partner or managing member, which joint ventures own 11 apartment communities containing 2,544 apartment homes, and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture in which we are a limited partner, which joint venture owns one apartment community containing 305 apartment homes; and a 40% ownership interest in unconsolidated joint venture arrangements with Equity Residential which will hold assets and liabilities that we and Equity Residential will jointly manage, and that we and Equity Residential intend to sell to or resolve with third parties, and/or subsequently transfer to Equity Residential or to us. In 2013, our capital activity related to funding the Archstone Acquisition as well as our core business activities in our development and redevelopment platforms. Our funding for the Archstone Acquisition included the assumption of approximately $2 billion in net indebtedness, as well as the issuance to Lehman of 14,889,706 shares of our common stock. In addition to this activity, during 2013 we raised approximately $1,682,800,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes and asset sales. The funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of eight communities for gross sales proceeds of $932,800,000. In addition, in February 2014 we sold one community, Avalon Valley, located in Danbury, CT, for $53,325,000. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. We believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. We increased development activity during 2013 from the prior year in anticipation of favorable economic conditions and apartment fundamentals. During 2013, we completed the development of 12 communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $630,000,000. We also started the development of 13 communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $1,323,000,000. In addition, during 2013 we completed the redevelopment of six communities for a total investment of $52,700,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment. We believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured 48 Table of Contents debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources. In addition to the Archstone Acquisition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we acquired Arboretum at Burlington, located in Burlington MA. Arboretum at Burlington contains 312 apartment homes and was acquired for a purchase price of $79,850,000. We established Fund I and Fund II (collectively the "Funds") to engage in real estate acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance of the Funds exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multi-family assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio. Fund I has nine institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund I and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of Fund I, we have an equity investment of approximately $14,209,000 in Fund I (net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a Fund I community), representing a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund I was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in March 2005 through the close of its investment period in March 2008. Fund I has a term that expires in March 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2013, Fund I sold seven communities: Avalon Yerba Buena, a 160 apartment home community with 32,300 square feet of retail located in San Francisco, CA, for $103,000,000; Avalon at Civic Center, a 192 apartment home community located in Norwalk, CA, for $45,844,000; Avalon at Cedar Place, a 156 apartment home community located in Columbia, MD, for $26,000,000; Avalon Sunset, a 82 apartment home community located in Los Angeles, CA for $25,800,000; Crystal Hill, a 169 apartment home community located in Pomona, NY for $33,050,000; Centerpoint, a 392 apartment home community located in Baltimore, MD for $75,250,000; and Middlesex Crossing, a 252 apartment home community located in Billerica, MA, for $40,250,000. Our proportionate share of the gain from the sale of these communities was $11,484,000. Fund II has six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of Fund II, we have made an equity investment of $93,714,000 (net of distributions), representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquired investment interests in apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. Fund II has a term that expires in August 2020, assuming the exercise of two one-year extension options. During the year ended December 31, 2013, Fund II sold Avalon Rothbury, located in Gaithersburg, MD, for $39,600,000. The Company's proportionate share of the gain in accordance with GAAP for the disposition was $2,790,000. In 2013, in conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, we acquired an interest in one additional discretionary real estate management investment fund. The U.S. Fund has six institutional investors, 49 Table of Contents including us. Through subsidiaries, we own the general partner of the U.S. Fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the U.S. Fund, we have made an equity investment of $93,685,000 (net of distributions), representing a 28.6% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. The U.S. Fund has a term that expires in July 2023, assuming the exercise of two one-year extension options. Communities Overview As of December 31, 2013, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 273 apartment communities containing 81,519 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 29 communities were under construction and three communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 36 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including four owned by subsidiaries of Fund I, 12 owned by subsidiaries of Fund II, and nine owned by the U.S. Fund. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 46 wholly-owned communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 12,986 apartment homes. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, Development Communities, and Development Rights. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities to be compared between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, "Segment Reporting," of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in "Results of Operations" as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found in "Liquidity and Capital Resources." NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities. Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of 50 Table of Contents NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity.

The decrease was partially offset by an increase in NOI from communities acquired in the Archstone Acquisition and our existing and newly developed communities in 2013, as well as an increase in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year. Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased $17,753,000, or 4.0% in 2012 over 2011 due primarily to a decrease in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year, offset partially by increased NOI in 2012 over 2011. 51 Table of Contents NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 12-31-13 12-31-12 12-31-11 Net income $ 352,771 $ 423,562 $ 441,370 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 41,554 31,911 30,550 Investments and investment management expense 3,990 6,071 5,126 Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs 45,050 11,350 2,967 Interest expense, net 172,402 136,920 167,814 Loss on interest rate contract 51,000 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 14,921 1,179 1,940 General and administrative expense 39,573 34,101 29,371 Loss (equity) in income of unconsolidated entities 11,154 (20,914 ) (5,120 ) Depreciation expense 560,215 243,680 226,728 Casualty and impairment loss 1,449 14,052 Gain on sale of real estate assets (278,471 ) (146,591 ) (294,806 ) Income from discontinued operations (16,713 ) (26,820 ) (20,065 ) Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity (14,194 ) Net operating income $ 997,446 $ 681,704 $ 599,927 The NOI increases for both 2013 and 2012, as compared to the prior year period, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): Full Year 2013 Full Year 2012 Established Communities $ 26,146 $ 35,412 Other Stabilized Communities 254,488 17,395 Development and Redevelopment Communities 35,108 28,970 Total $ 315,742 $ 81,777 The increase in our Established Communities' NOI in 2013 is due to increased rental rates and increased occupancy, partially offset by increased operating expenses. During 2013, we experienced increases in rental rates over 2012, while maintaining occupancy of at least 95% in all markets, offset partially by an increase in operating expenses. Rental and other income increased in both 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities, including those acquired in the Archstone Acquisition in 2013, and increases in rental rates and occupancy at our Established Communities. 52 Table of Contents Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 57,240 apartment homes for 2013, which includes the impact of communities acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, as compared to 43,411 homes for 2012 and 42,613 homes for 2011. The increase in 2013 over 2012 is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities, which includes the impact of communities acquired in the Archstone Acquisition offset partially by communities sold during 2013 and 2012. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,171 for 2013 as compared to $2,017 in 2012 and $1,911 in 2011. Established Communities Rental revenue increased $34,749,000, or 4.3%, for 2013 and increased $41,698,000 or 5.8%, for 2012 as compared to the respective prior years. For 2013, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 4.2% to $2,156 compared to $2,069 in 2012. The increase for 2013 is due to an increase in rental rates of 4.2% and economic occupancy of 0.1% to 96.2%. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities regions in 2013 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below. The Metro New York/New Jersey region, which accounted for approximately 29.9% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2013, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 4.3% for 2013 as compared to 2012. Average rental rates increased 4.3% during 2013 to $2,563 and economic occupancy remained consistent at 96.5%. Apartment demand in the Metro New York/New Jersey region is being driven by job growth across a diverse group of industries including healthcare, professional business services, technology, retail, hospitality and education. The region also experienced an increase in construction related employment growth related to Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. We expect to see continued but moderating growth in the Metro New York/New Jersey region in 2014. New York City is beginning to see a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries in 2014, but suburban markets surrounding the city are mostly insulated from this new competition. The New England region accounted for approximately 21.3% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.2% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 3.1% to $2,137, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 95.8% for 2013 as compared to 2012. The New England region's favorable results are driven by employment growth in the medical, education and technology fields in the Boston metro area. In response to a favorable employment market, the region benefitted from an in-migration. The Boston metro area is seeing a recovery in for-sale housing ahead of most other regions, resulting in resurgence in suburban employment. The Fairfield market continues to experience slower growth due to this market's greater exposure to the financial services sector, which has experienced slower job growth during this recovery than other industries. While demand drivers should become more favorable in 2014, we expect this market to continue to lag due to new supply pressure, particularly in and around Stamford. The Northern California region accounted for approximately 16.9% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 8.1% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 7.8% to $2,335, and economic occupancy increased 0.3% to 96.3% for 2013 as compared to 2012. While new apartment supply may slow revenue growth in future periods, we expect the strength in the technology and medical sectors to continue to fuel demand for apartment homes in 2014. 53 Table of Contents The Southern California region accounted for approximately 14.3% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.9% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 3.7% to $1,767, and economic occupancy increased 0.2% to 96.3% for 2013 as compared to 2012. Southern California has seen steady job growth and limited new apartment supply which we expect will continue to support favorable operating results in 2014. The Mid-Atlantic region, which represented approximately 12.0% of the Established Community rental revenue during 2013, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 0.8% as compared to 2012. Average rental rates increased by 0.9% to $1,967, and were partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 0.1% to 95.9% for 2013 as compared to 2012. The region experienced a modest decrease in revenue growth in the second half of 2013, driven by an increase in the supply of apartment homes combined with the impact of the decline in federal government spending. We expect rental revenue to decline further in the Mid-Atlantic region during 2014 as additional supply is delivered into the market. The Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 5.6% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2013 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 7.2% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 7.5% to $1,695, and were partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of 0.3% to 95.7% for 2013 as compared to 2012. The region's innovative technology, e-commerce, and manufacturing sectors continue to support growth in the economy and improvement in apartment fundamentals. Rental revenue growth may be tempered in the near term due to the increased supply of apartment homes in 2014, particularly in the urban core of Seattle, which may affect our future revenue growth in this region. Management, development and other fees increased $1,245,000 or 12.1%, in 2013 and increased $601,000, or 6.2%, in 2012 as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to management fees related to the U.S. Fund and the AC JV, partially offset by lower property management and other management fees earned related to dispositions from Fund I and Fund II. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to increased asset management fees and property management fees from Fund II over the prior year. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $84,064,000, or 39.8%, and $9,553,000, or 4.7%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment homes, including the communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed apartment homes. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $4,374,000, or 2.6%, in 2013 and decreased $475,000, or 0.3%, in 2012 as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance, insurance, and office operations costs. Property taxes increased $61,219,000, or 62.8%, and $8,591,000, or 9.7%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment homes, including communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition, coupled with increased tax rates and assessments across our portfolio. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments. Property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals. For Established Communities, property taxes increased $4,282,000, or 5.4%, and $4,581,000, or 6.5%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2013 was due to higher rates and assessments, partially offset by higher successful appeals and refunds received in 2013, 54 Table of Contents as compared to the prior year. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). Massachusetts also has laws in place to limit property tax increases. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to appeals and settlements recognized in 2011 that were not present in 2012, coupled with increased rates and assessments throughout our regions. We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased $10,912,000, or 25.9%, in 2013 and increased $1,980,000, or 4.9%, in 2012, as compared to the prior years. The increases in both years were primarily due to increased compensation related costs, with the increase in 2013 over 2012 including the increase in overhead associated with the Archstone Acquisition. The increase in 2012 was also attributable to costs associated with our introduction and implementation of our AVA and Eaves by Avalon brands. Investments and investment management costs decreased $2,081,000, or 34.3%, in 2013 and increased by $945,000, or 18.4%, in 2012, due to reductions in compensation costs, as our investment fund management activity has declined. Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred related to our asset investment activity, abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights, acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These costs increased $33,700,000, or 296.9%, and $8,383,000, or 282.5%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as compared to the prior years, primarily due to costs associated with the Archstone Acquisition. Interest expense, net increased $35,482,000, or 25.9%, in 2013 and decreased $30,894,000, or 18.4%, in 2012, as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development activity, amortization of the mark to market adjustment on debt assumed as part of the Archstone Acquisition, and interest income. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to net interest costs on debt assumed in the Archstone Acquisition, partially offset by increased capitalized interest as compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2012 was primarily due to decreased average outstanding indebtedness and lower average effective interest rates coupled with increased capitalized interest. This decrease was partially offset by interest income associated with escrow accounts for certain tax exempt secured borrowings recognized in 2011 that were not present in 2012. The increase in capitalized interest in both 2013 and 2012 over the respective prior years was driven primarily by increased development activity and development pursuits. Loss on interest rate contract reflects the loss recorded by the Company related to the forward interest rate protection agreement that matured in May 2013. Based on changes in the Company's capital needs in 2013, the Company did not issue the anticipated debt for which the interest rate protection agreement was transacted. Loss on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects prepayment penalties, the expensing of deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired, excluding costs related to debt secured by assets sold or held for sale, which is included in discontinued operations, below. During 2013, we incurred a charge for prepayment penalties and the write-off of deferred fees related to the early retirement of three secured notes. During 2012, we recognized a non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note. 55 Table of Contents Depreciation expense increased $316,535,000 or 129.9%, and $16,952, or 7.5%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to additional depreciation expense from the Archstone Acquisition, consisting largely of the depreciation of in-place lease intangibles, which were depreciated over a six month period. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development, redevelopment and acquisition activity, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during the year. General and administrative expense ("G&A") increased $5,472,000, or 16.0%, and $4,730,000, or 16.1% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in both years were primarily due to increased compensation costs, including costs related to the Archstone Acquisition in 2013. The increase in 2012 was also due to increased professional fees. Casualty and impairment loss for 2012 consists of the losses we incurred associated with Superstorm Sandy. Amounts for 2011 consist of the write down of two land parcels and an other than temporary impairment of an investment in unconsolidated joint venture. Gain on sale of land decreased in 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior years, due to decreased volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels. Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity represents the amount by which the fair value of our prior ownership interest in the joint venture that owned Avalon Del Rey exceeded our carrying value. Equity in (loss) income of unconsolidated entities decreased $32,068,000, or 153.3%, in 2013 and increased $15,794,000, or 308.5%, in 2012, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2013 is primarily due to costs of approximately $39,543,000 associated with the Archstone Acquisition that were incurred through the unconsolidated joint venture entities owned with Equity Residential during the year. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to the recognition of income from our promoted interest for Avalon Del Rey and an increase in our proportionate share of gains from Fund I disposition activity over the prior year. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by real estate sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. Income from discontinued operations decreased in 2013 and increased in 2012, due to changes in the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area as compared to the prior year. See Note 7, "Real Estate Disposition Activities," to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on sale of communities increased in 2013 and decreased in 2012, due to changes in the volume of community disposition activity and associated gains as compared to the prior year. The amount of gain realized upon disposition of communities depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in an allocation of loss of $370,000 in 2013, $307,000 in 2012, and $252,000 in 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and 56 Table of Contents normal recurring operating expenses. Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. In 2014, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, which may include real estate dispositions, cash balances on hand, borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, secured and unsecured debt financings, and other public or private sources of liquidity including the issuance of common and preferred equity, as well as cash generated from our operating activities. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. Capital raising activities in 2013 included asset sales, the issuance of unsecured notes in September and December, and the issuance of common shares to Lehman and assumption of secured debt as part of the Archstone Acquisition. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $281,541,000 at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $2,452,077,000 from $2,733,618,000 at December 31, 2012. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $724,501,000 in 2013 from $540,819,000 in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by increased NOI from community operations in 2013 as compared to 2012 and the timing of payments of corporate expenditures. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $1,181,174,000 in 2013 primarily related to investments in assets through acquisition, development and redevelopment. In 2013, we invested $2,151,799,000 in the following areas: we invested $839,469,000 in the acquisition of real estate related to acquisitions, primarily the Archstone Acquisition; we invested $1,285,715,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; and we had capital expenditures of $26,615,000 for real estate and non-real estate assets. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,995,404,000 in 2013. The net cash used is due to the repayment of $2,110,347,000 in secured notes and prepayment penalties, primarily in conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, payment of cash dividends in the amount of $526,050,000, and the repayment of $100,000,000 in unsecured notes, partially offset by the issuance of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility The Company has a $1,300,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the "Credit Facility") which matures in April 2017. We may extend the maturity for up to one year through the exercise of two, six month extension options for an aggregate fee of $1,950,000. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate 57 Table of Contents ("LIBOR"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 1.05% (1.21% at January 31, 2014 assuming a one month borrowing rate). The annual facility fee is 0.15% (or approximately $1,950,000 annually based on the $1,300,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating). We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $66,396,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2014. Financial Covenants We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The financial covenants include the following: limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and minimum levels of debt service coverage. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2013. In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured. Continuous Equity Offering Program In August 2012, we commenced a third continuous equity program ("CEP III"), under which we are authorized by our Board of Directors to sell up to $750,000,000 of shares of our common stock from time to time during a 36-month period. In conjunction with CEP III we have engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we had no sales under CEP III and have $646,274,000 of shares that remain authorized for issuance under this program. Issuance of Common Stock in Archstone Acquisition During 2013 we issued 14,889,706 shares of common stock to Lehman (as defined in Note 5, "Archstone Acquisition" of our Consolidated Financial Statements) in conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition. On February 18, 2014, Lehman announced that it had sold all of the shares of our common stock it received as consideration for the Archstone Acquisition. Lehman received all of the net proceeds from the sale of its shares of our common stock, and Lehman's sale of such shares did not impact the total number of the our shares of common stock outstanding. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or repay the debt. This refinancing or repayment may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to 58 Table of Contents meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following additional financing activity occurred during 2013: In connection with the Archstone Acquisition, we assumed $2,034,482,000 net principal amount of Archstone's existing secured indebtedness, detailed in the following table. In March 2013, we repaid $100,000,000 principal amount of 4.95% unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity. In April 2013, we obtained a 3.06% fixed rate secured mortgage loan in the amount of $15,000,000 that matures in April 2018. In April 2013, we repaid a 4.69% fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $170,125,000 pursuant to its scheduled maturity date. In May 2013, we repaid a $5,393,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 5.55% at par and without penalty in advance of its July 2028 scheduled maturity date. In May 2013, we obtained a 3.08% fixed rate secured mortgage loan that matures in June 2020 in the amount of $56,210,000, in association with the refinancing of an existing $47,000,000 variable rate secured mortgage note. The refinancing was necessitated by the secured community-specific tax protection obligation assumed through certain of the preferred interests we assumed as part of the Archstone Acquisition. In May 2013, we repaid a $52,806,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 5.24% pursuant to its scheduled maturity date. In September 2013, we issued $400,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $396,212,000. The notes mature in October 2020 and were issued at a 3.63% interest rate. The notes have an effective interest rate of 3.79% including the effect of offering costs. In December 2013, we issued $350,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $346,934,000. The notes mature in December 2023 and were issued at a 4.20% interest rate. The notes have an effective interest rate of 4.30% including the effect of offering costs. In December 2013, we repaid a $150,000,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 5.66%, a $110,600,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 5.48%, and a $41,439,000 fixed rate secured mortgage note with an interest rate of 4.75%, in advance of their 2015 maturity dates, and incurred a charge for repayment penalties and the write-off of deferred fees of $14,921,000. The following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands) as compared to the amounts of debt outstanding as of at December 31, 2012. We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have any equity or other interest. 59 Table of Contents Balance Outstanding Scheduled maturities All-In interest rate(1) Principal maturity date Community 12-31-12 12-31-13 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter

(7) Borrowing was assumed as part of the Archstone Acquisition. (8) Borrowing was repaid in May 2013 at par in advance of its scheduled maturity in July 2028. (9) In July 2013 we remarketed the bonds converting them to variable rate through July 2018. (10) Borrowing was repaid in December 2013 in advance of its 2015 scheduled maturity. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2013, we had 29 wholly-owned communities under construction, and three wholly-owned communities under reconstruction. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing Development Rights will be funded from: our $1,300,000,000 Credit Facility; cash currently on hand, invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles; retained operating cash; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding, including joint venture activity. 61 Table of Contents Before planned construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures begins, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Investments As of December 31, 2013, we had investments in unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 5, "Archstone Acquisition," and Note 6, "Investments in Real Estate Entities" of the Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as 62 Table of Contents operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. Detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table.

(2) We have not guaranteed the debt of unconsolidated investees and bear no responsibility for the repayment. (3) Represents weighted average rate on outstanding debt as of December 31, 2013. (4) Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, we consolidated the net assets and results of operations of The Springs. (5) Borrowing on this community is comprised of two mortgage loans. (6) This community is currently under redevelopment for which the venture is expecting to invest $32.9 million. Currently approximately one half of the apartment homes are not in service due to the redevelopment. This community is owned through a leasehold interest. (7) The debt secured by this community is a variable rate note converted to an effective fixed rate borrowing with an interest rate swap. (8) As discussed in this report, the venture commenced the construction of a third operating community in Cambridge, MA that, when completed, is expected to contain 103 apartments homes for a total capitalized cost of $28,000,000. (9) Borrowing is comprised of four mortgage loans made by the equity investors in the venture in proportion to their equity interests. 63 Table of Contents (10) After the venture makes certain threshold distributions to the third-party partner, we will generally receive 50% of all further distributions. (11) Our ownership interest of 8.0% is determined by our 40.0% ownership interest in the joint venture entity with Equity Residential which owns a 20% interest in this joint venture. (12) Maturity date represents the earliest of the maturity dates on the two loans and six draws on the credit facility relating to the six communities owned by SWIB. Maturity dates range from December 2014 to December 2029. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, "Investments in Real Estate Entities," of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. Subsidiaries of Fund I have four loans secured by individual assets with aggregate amounts outstanding of $66,132,000, including $22,169,000 for the mortgage note of a Fund I subsidiary that we purchased during 2010. Fund I subsidiary loans have varying maturity dates (and, in some cases, dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from October 2014 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund I with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund I, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund I be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund I, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund I, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund I (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $7,500,000 as of December 31, 2013). As of December 31, 2013, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund I is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund I liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under, this guarantee both at inception and as of December 31, 2013, was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, subsidiaries of Fund II have 13 loans secured by individual assets with aggregate amounts outstanding of $467,959,000 with varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from November 2014 to September 2019. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund II with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund II, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund II be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $8,910,000 as of December 31, 2013). As of December 31, 2013, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund II is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund II liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under, this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2013, was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2013. 64 Table of Contents Each individual mortgage loan of Fund I or Fund II was made to a special purpose, single asset subsidiary of the Funds. Each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only, except under exceptional circumstances (such as fraud or misapplication of funds) in which case the respective Fund could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan. In no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in the Funds, including against us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries that invest in the Funds. A default by a Fund or a Fund subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other "non-Fund" subsidiaries or affiliates. If either the Funds or a subsidiary of one of the Funds were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, the value of our investment in that Fund would likely decline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to one of the Fund partners in each Fund as described above. If a Fund subsidiary or a Fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we and/or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support the Fund through additional equity contributions and/or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default (such as foreclosure of a Fund asset). In the future, in the event either of the Funds were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of either of the Funds and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve. CVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon Chrystie Place I, has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturating in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We have not guaranteed the debt of CVP I, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should CVP I, LLC be unable to do so. MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $105,000,000. The loan is a fixed rate, interest-only note bearing interest at 6.02%, maturing in December 2015. We have not guaranteed the debt of MVP I, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should MVP I, LLC be unable to do so. In conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, the Company acquired interests in the following entities: The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. As of December 31, 2013, the U.S. Fund owns nine communities containing 1,726 apartment homes, one of which includes a marina containing 229 boat slips. Through subsidiaries we own the general partner of the U.S. Fund and hold a 28.6% interest in the U.S. Fund. As of December 31, 2013, subsidiaries of the U.S. Fund have nine loans secured by individual assets with aggregate amounts outstanding of $327,849,000 with varying maturity dates, ranging from January 2019 to November 2022. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of the U.S. Fund with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of the U.S. Fund, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the U.S. Fund be unable to do so. The AC JV is a joint venture in which we acquired Archstone's 20% ownership interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011 and as of December 31, 2013 owned two operating apartment communities containing 818 apartment homes in Cambridge, MA and Herndon, VA. The AC JV partnership agreement contains provisions that require the Company to provide a ROFO to the AC JV in connection with additional opportunities to acquire or develop additional interests in multifamily real estate assets within a specified geographic radius of the existing assets, generally 65 Table of Contents one mile or less. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company provided the AC JV with the opportunity to acquire a parcel of land owned by the Company as required in the right of first offer provisions for the joint venture. The AC JV exercised its right to acquire the land parcel for development and commenced construction of an additional apartment community located in Cambridge, MA, which is expected to contain 103 apartment homes and be completed for a total capitalized cost of $28,000,000. The Company sold the parcel of land to the AC JV in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit, and is overseeing the development in exchange for a developer fee. The Company owns one additional land parcel for the development of 301 apartment homes, classified as a Development Right in Cambridge, MA, acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition that is subject to ROFO restrictions. The ROFO restriction expires in 2019. As of December 31, 2013, subsidiaries of the AC JV have eight unsecured loans outstanding in the aggregate amount of $162,300,000 which mature in July 2021, and which were made by the investors in the venture, including us, in proportion to the investors' respective equity ownership interest. The unsecured loans are payable by the subsidiaries of the AC JV with operating cash flow from the venture. We have not guaranteed the debt of the AC JV, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the AC JV be unable to do so. Brandywine owns a 305 apartment home community located in Washington, DC. The community is managed by a third party. Brandywine is comprised of five members who hold various interests in the joint venture. In conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, we acquired a 26.1% equity interest in the venture, and subsequently purchased an additional 2.6% interest, and as of December 31, 2013, hold a 28.7% equity interest in the venture. As of December 31, 2013, Brandywine has an outstanding $24,839,000 fixed rate mortgage loan that is payable by Brandywine. We have not guaranteed the debt of Brandywine, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Brandywine be unable to do so. Through subsidiaries, the Company and Equity Residential entered into three limited liability company agreements (collectively, the "Residual JV") through which the Company and Equity Residential acquired (i) certain assets of Archstone that the Company and Equity Residential plan to divest (to third parties or to the Company or Equity Residential) over time (the "Residual Assets"), and (ii) various liabilities of Archstone that the Company and Equity Residential agreed to assume in conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition (the "Residual Liabilities"). The Residual Assets include interests in apartment communities in Germany (including through a fund which Archstone managed); a 20.0% interest in SWIB, a joint venture which owns and manages six apartment communities with 1,902 apartment homes in the United States; two land parcels; and various licenses, insurance policies, contracts, office leases and other miscellaneous assets. The Residual Liabilities generally include most existing or future litigation and claims related to Archstone's operations for periods before the close of the Archstone Acquisition, except for (i) claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by the Company or Equity Residential, which generally remain the sole responsibility of the Company or Equity Residential, as applicable, and (ii) certain tax and other litigation between Archstone and various equity holders in Archstone related to periods before the close of the Archstone Acquisition, and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of Archstone that occurred prior to closing, for which Lehman has agreed to indemnify the Company and Equity Residential. The Company and Equity Residential jointly control the Residual JV and the Company generally holds a 40% economic interest in the assets and liabilities of the Residual JV. 66 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2013, SWIB has two loans and draws on a credit facility secured by individual assets with aggregate amounts outstanding of $187,021,000 with varying maturity dates, ranging from December 2014 to December 2029. We have not guaranteed the debt of SWIB, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should SWIB be unable to do so. There are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest. Contractual Obligations Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt Obligations $ 6,029,998 $ 166,986 $ 903,972 $ 1,075,354 $ 3,883,686 Interest on Debt Obligations 2,179,768 259,520 484,354 359,229 1,076,665 Capital Lease Obligations(1) 64,461 1,863 20,968 1,696 39,934 Operating Lease Obligations(1) 1,345,871 19,801 39,185 38,191 1,248,694 $ 9,620,098 $ 448,170 $ 1,448,479 $ 1,474,470 $ 6,248,979 (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "project," "plan," "may," "shall," "will" and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; 67 Table of Contents cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including the potential impacts from the economic conditions; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a. "Risk Factors," in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; 68 Table of Contents our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of Fund I, Fund II, the U.S. Fund, the AC JV or the REIT vehicles that are used with each of them; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, "Organization and Basis of Presentation" of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method, excluding joint venture entities the company formed with Equity Residential as part of the Archstone Acquisition, at December 31, 2013, our assets would have increased by $1,925,274,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $1,280,744,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. 69 Table of Contents Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $38,128,000, $26,513,000, and $23,984,000 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2013 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our costs charged to expense would have increased by $3,813,000. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 would have decreased by $3,159,000. Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment We evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. Such assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the 70 Table of Contents carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we did not recognize any impairment losses for wholly-owned operating real estate assets. We expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits, which includes the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits, in the amounts of $998,000 in 2013, $1,757,000 in 2012 and $1,957,000 in 2011. These costs are included in operating expenses, excluding property taxes on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. We also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We did not recognize any impairment charges for land holdings in 2013 or 2012. During 2011, we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels where the carrying values of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable. As a result, we recognized an aggregate charge of $12,097,000 for the impairment of these land parcels. We had previously recognized an impairment loss of $9,952,000 in 2008 when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets. Our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis of the land parcels existed. We looked to a combination of internal models and third-party pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels. Considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development, the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model. Land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using third-party estimates of fair value. For the internally generated fair values, we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community. The cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make, including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying asset, as well as potential disposition proceeds. The third-party values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return, investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables, adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements (such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness). Both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy. We also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments. During 2011, we concluded that because the market for for-sale housing development had not improved as expected, the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary. As a result, we recognized a charge of $1,955,000 for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. There were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during 2013 or 2012. Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1a., "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for the year ended 71 Table of Contents December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2013, our net income would have decreased by approximately $141,963,000. Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate. Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which requires the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. Typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, building, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. Federal Income Tax Changes and Updates for Incorporation in Existing Registration Statements The following discussion updates the disclosures under " Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment " in the prospectus dated February 27, 2012 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2012 and in our other registration statements into which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference. Additional Disclosure Relating to Taxation of AvalonBay as a REIT The section captioned " Taxation of AvalonBay as a REIT Ownership of Partnership Interests by a REIT " is replaced in its entirety by the following: Ownership of Partnership Interests by a REIT. A REIT that is a partner in a partnership (or a member in a limited liability company or other entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and will be deemed to earn its proportionate share of the partnership's income. The assets and gross income of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to REITs as described below. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets and items of gross income of any entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which we hold an interest will be treated as our assets and liabilities and our items of income for purposes of applying the requirements described in this prospectus. The assets, liabilities and items of income of any partnership in which we own an interest include such entity's share of the assets and liabilities and items of income with respect to any partnership in which it holds an interest. The assets of one of our joint ventures with Equity Residential include indirect interests in partnerships controlled by Equity Residential, and thus for purposes of our compliance with the REIT asset and gross income requirements we will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the assets and as receiving our proportionate share of gross income of the Equity Residential partnerships in which the joint venture has an interest. Although Equity Residential has agreed to operate those 72 Table of Contents partnerships in compliance with the REIT requirements, we cannot assure you that such Equity Residential partnerships will be operated in compliance with the REIT requirements. Failure by those partnerships to comply with the REIT requirements could potentially jeopardize our REIT status. The discussion above does not apply to our interest in any partnership or other unincorporated entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an entity that we treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the REIT requirements were determined instead to be taxed as a corporation, we could fail one or more of the REIT income and asset tests described below. Generally, a domestic unincorporated entity with two or more owners is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless it affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation. However, certain "publicly traded partnerships" are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A "publicly traded partnership" is any partnership (i) the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or (ii) the interests in which are readily tradable on a "secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof." However, under the relevant Treasury Regulations, interests in a partnership will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market or on the substantial equivalent of a secondary market if the partnership qualifies for specified "safe harbors," which are based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to the partnership. Moreover, certain publicly traded partnerships will avoid being treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the partnership derives at least 90% of its gross income from certain specified sources of "qualifying income." We do not believe that any of our direct or indirect subsidiary partnerships should be treated as corporations under the publicly traded partnership rules. However, a contrary determination could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT. The fifth paragraph in the section captioned " Taxation of AvalonBay as a REIT Income Tests Applicable to REITs " is replaced with the following: Taxable dividends from a taxable REIT subsidiary and gain from a sale or other taxable disposition of interests in a taxable REIT subsidiary will qualify under the 95% income test, but not the 75% income test. Our need to satisfy the 75% income test may adversely affect our ability to distribute earnings from, or dispose of our investment in, a taxable REIT subsidiary. The following paragraph is added at the end of the section captioned " Taxation of AvalonBay as a REIT Asset Tests Applicable to REITs ": Shares in other qualifying REITs are treated as "real estate assets" for purposes of the REIT assets tests, while shares of our taxable REIT subsidiaries do not qualify as "real estate assets." The last sentence in the section captioned " Other U.S. Federal Income Tax Withholding and Reporting Requirements " is replaced with the following: The most recent guidance from the IRS delays withholding under FATCA on withholdable payments to foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities until after December 31, 2016 with respect to gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends and certain other sources of income and after June 30, 2014 with respect to other withholdable payments. The section captioned " Expiration of Certain Reduced Tax Provisions " is replaced with the following: Federal Income Tax Rates Update As of January 1, 2013, (1) the maximum tax rate on "qualified dividend income" for non-corporate taxpayers is 20%, (2) the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gain for non-corporate taxpayers is 20%, (3) the highest marginal non-corporate income tax rate is 39.6%, and (4) the backup withholding rate remains at 28%. Thus, references in the prospectus to "15% rate gain distributions" shall be replaced with references to "20% rate gain distributions," which are taxed to non-corporate U.S. shareholders at the new maximum 20% long-term capital gains rate. 73 Table of Contents
