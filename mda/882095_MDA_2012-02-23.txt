ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors ). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. Management Overview Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we or us), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need. With each new discovery and experimental drug candidate, we seek to improve the care of patients suffering from life-threatening diseases around the world. Gilead primary areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, liver diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and serious cardiovascular/metabolic and respiratory conditions. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. We continue to seek to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy. Our product portfolio is comprised of Atripla , Truvada , Viread , Emtriva , Complera /Eviplera , Hepsera , AmBisome , Letairis , Ranexa , Cayston and Vistide . In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. For example, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu ; GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Hepsera and Viread in certain territories outside of the United States; GSK also markets Volibris outside of the United States; Astellas Pharma US, Inc. markets AmBisome in the United States and Canada; Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan injection in the United States; Rapidscan Pharma Solutions, Inc. markets Rapiscan in certain territories outside of the United States; Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa in certain territories outside of the United States; and Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) markets Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan. Business Highlights During 2011, we continued to advance our pipeline and internal programs across our therapeutic areas. We augmented these efforts through strategic investments in acquisitions, in-licensing opportunities and collaborations. In the liver disease area, our acquisition of Pharmasset Inc. (Pharmasset) in early 2012 marks a significant opportunity to continue developing best-in-class drugs. We believe the combination of our existing internal research programs and our recent partnerships and acquisitions will drive research and development efforts and accelerate our product pipeline so that we can continue to bring innovative therapies to individuals around the world who are living with unmet medical needs. Below is a summary of our key accomplishments: received marketing approval for and began launching Complera/Eviplera, our second single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV in the United States, Canada and certain countries of the European Union; submitted new drug application (NDA) for Quad single-tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HIV six weeks after the Phase 3 studies concluded; obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreement for a revision of the Letairis label, which subsequently changed the sales trajectory for the product; 56 Table of Contents progressed GS-7340, an investigational nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and completed collaborative agreements in the HIV field which set the stage for a third generation of single-tablet regimens; accelerated our timeline to develop the first all-oral HCV regimen as a result of the Pharmasset acquisition; and completed the Arresto Biosciences, Inc. (Arresto) and Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Calistoga) acquisitions and acquired the Oceanside, California facility for biologics manufacturing to support advancing clinical studies in oncology. New and Potential Product Offerings and New Drug Applications In the area of HIV, we continued efforts to expand our product offerings of single-tablet regimens with the launch of Complera/Eviplera and submission of our Quad for regulatory approval in the United States and Europe. In August 2011, we received FDA approval for Complera for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-na ve adults. Complera combines three antiretroviral medications in one daily tablet our Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and Edurant (rilpivirine), marketed by Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec). In November 2011, we received marketing approval for the product in Europe, where the product is marketed as Eviplera. In October 2011, we submitted a NDA to the FDA for the marketing approval of Quad for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. Subsequently, the FDA accepted the NDA and has set a target review date of August 27, 2012 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The FDA has indicated that a panel will be convened in May 2012 to provide expert advice on the application. We submitted the marketing authorisation application for Quad for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults to the European Medicines Agency in November 2011. In December 2011, we announced that Phase 3 clinical trials of our pharmacoenhancing or boosting agent cobicistat, met its 48-week primary object of non-inferiority. Cobicistat increases blood levels of certain HIV medicines to allow for one pill once-daily dosing. The study indicated that after 48 weeks of treatment, 85 percent of patients taking a regimen of cobicistat-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada achieved comparable results with patients taking ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada. Also in December 2011, we announced Phase 3 clinical trial results showing that elvitegravir, an integrase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, was non-inferior to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir after two years of therapy in treatment-experienced patients. The results of the study indicate that elvitegravir has the potential to become a new once-daily treatment option for those with HIV who have developed resistance to other therapies. Acquisitions In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Arresto for $225 million plus potential future payments based on achievement of certain sales levels. Arresto was a privately-held, development-stage biotechnology company based in Palo Alto, California, focused on developing antibodies for the potential treatment of fibrotic diseases and cancer. The lead product from this acquisition was GS-6624, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the human lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) protein. In addition to ongoing Phase 2 studies of GS-6624 in liver fibrosis, myelofibrosis, colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, a Phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate GS-6624 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In April 2011, we acquired Calistoga for $375 million plus potential payments of up to $225 million based on the achievement of certain milestones. Calistoga was a privately-held, biotechnology company based in Seattle, Washington, focused on the development of medicines to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases. The 57 Table of Contents portfolio of proprietary compounds from this acquisition selectively targeted isoforms of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). Calistoga lead product candidate, GS-1101, was a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the PI3K delta isoform. PI3K delta is preferentially expressed in leukocytes involved in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and hematological cancers. In November 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire Pharmasset for $11.1 billion. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand, bank debt and senior unsecured notes. The acquisition was completed in January 2012. Pharmasset was a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company located in Princeton, New Jersey, committed to discovering, developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections. Pharmasset primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of HCV. Pharmasset research and development (R&D) efforts were focused on nucleoside/tide analogs, a class of compounds that act as alternative substrates for the viral polymerase, thus inhibiting viral replication. In-Licensing and Collaborations In June 2011, we entered into an agreement with Tibotec for the development and commercialization of a new fixed-dose combination product containing our cobicistat and Tibotec protease inhibitor Prezista (darunavir), indicated for the treatment of HIV. Prezista is currently co-administered with ritonavir in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In October 2011, we entered into an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) for worldwide rights for the research, development and commercialization of BI novel non-catalytic site integrase inhibitors for HIV. This includes the lead compound BI 224436, which has been evaluated in a Phase 1a dose-escalation study to assess bioavailability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. Also in October 2011, we entered into an agreement with GlobeImmune, Inc. for the license, development and commercialization of therapeutic vaccine products for use in conjunction with Viread and other oral therapies for the treatment of the chronic HBV infection. Also in October 2011, we entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) for the licensing, development and commercialization of a fixed-dose combination containing BMS protease inhibitor Reyataz (atazanavir sulfate) and our cobicistat. We are currently studying atazanavir and cobicistat in Phase 2 and 3 studies in HIV-1 treatment-na ve patients. In November 2011, we entered into an agreement with Tibotec for the development and commercialization of a single-tablet regimen combining Tibotec Prezista with our Emtriva, GS-7340 and cobicistat. Financial Highlights During 2011, in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment, we continued to grow our business and achieved total product sales of $8.10 billion for 2011, an increase of 10% over 2010. The growth in product sales was primarily driven by growth in our antiviral franchise, where sales increased 8% to $7.05 billion when compared to the prior year. Sales of other products, which are comprised primarily of AmBisome, Ranexa and Letairis reached $1.05 billion, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year. Total revenues during 2011 grew 5% to $8.39 billion. Our product sales growth was partially offset by a decline in royalty revenues from our collaborations with corporate partners, which were $268.8 million for 2011, a decrease of 51% from 2010 primarily due to lower Tamiflu royalties as pandemic planning initiatives worldwide have declined. Gross margin decreased from 75% in 2010 to 74% in 2011 primarily due to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of Atripla that is paid to our partner. R&D expenses were $1.23 billion for 2011 and $1.07 billion for 2010, an increase of $156.2 million, or 15%. The increase was due primarily to costs related to clinical studies and the impact of higher headcount and 58 Table of Contents expenses associated with acquisitions, collaborations and the ongoing growth of our business. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $1.24 billion for 2011 and $1.04 billion for 2010, an increase of $197.6 million, or 19%. The increase was due primarily to the increased expenses associated with the ongoing growth of our business, the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform and increased bad debt provision due to slower collections in certain Southern European countries. Net income for 2011 was $2.80 billion, a 3% decrease from $2.90 billion in 2010 due primarily to the investments we made in our existing clinical programs and through acquisitions, in-licensing and collaboration agreements and lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche as a result of declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Our diluted earnings per share increased by 7% to $3.55 in 2011 from $3.32 in 2010, which incorporates the impact of our share repurchases throughout the year. Financing Activity Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $4.65 billion during 2011 to a total of $9.96 billion at December 31, 2011. The primary sources of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities during 2011 were operating cash flows of $3.64 billion and $4.66 billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December of 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition. Key uses of cash during the year included $2.38 billion for repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $650.0 million for the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in 2011 and $588.6 million for acquisition activities in 2011. During 2011, we completed our May 2010, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program and commenced share repurchases under a three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2011. In 2011, we spent a total of $2.38 billion of cash to repurchase and retire 59.9 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $39.80 per share. Subsequent Events In January 2012, we raised $2.15 billion in bank debt to partially fund the acquisition of Pharmasset. We acquired Pharmasset for $11.1 billion through a cash tender offer and subsequent merger, which closed in January 2012. Pharmasset lead compound was a nucleotide analog in HCV-infected individuals across genotypes now known as GS-7977. During 2012, we expect to receive a significant amount of data from clinical trials evaluating GS-7977. On February 17, 2012, we announced that data indicates that GS-7977 with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 1 patients with a prior null response to an interferon-containing regimen for 12 weeks will not be sufficient to cure their disease. We are currently conducting additional Phase 2 studies in HCV infected genotype 1 patients, including treatment-na ve patients, the results of which we expect at the end of the first quarter, in the second quarter and early in the third quarter of 2012. Outlook 2012 Our operating objectives for 2012 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. From an R&D standpoint, we will continue to execute on our pipeline development with a particular focus on innovative HIV single-tablet regimens for patients, progression of our HCV molecules into and through the clinic and new initiatives in oncology and inflammation. In 2012, we expect to publicly announce additional data sets related to the development of GS-7977 for treatment of HCV that will affect the cost and duration of our development efforts for GS-7977. 59 Table of Contents From a commercial standpoint, we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV area, the scientific arguments to diagnose and treat patients earlier are strong and the reasons to use single-tablet regimens are compelling both medically and practically. The extension of the Ryan White Treatment Act should provide stable funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) in the United States through 2013. During 2012, we will continue to roll out Complera/Eviplera around the world and, subject to FDA approval of Quad, bring our third single-tablet regimen to individuals in the U.S. living with HIV. In 2011, we launched the Truvada/rilpivirine single-tablet regimen for treatment of HIV as Complera in the United States and Canada and as Eviplera in the United Kingdom and Austria. In 2012, we expect continued uptake of Complera in the United States and Canada and to launch Eviplera throughout Europe. Our Quad is being reviewed by the FDA with a PDUFA date of August 27, 2012. Assuming approval, we expect to launch the product in September 2012. We expect Quad to contribute incremental revenue to our HIV franchise. In the HBV area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on U.S. Asian communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to care. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of Letairis and Ranexa in 2012. We are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect our business include: future changes to healthcare reform in the United States, a continuation or worsening of global economic conditions, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to mitigate these risks to our business. We believe the successes we experienced in 2011 have enabled us to continue to build a financially sound business model that will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2012. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 60 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Product Sales We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management. Government Rebates We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled either by us being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, U.S government rebates of $1.85 billion, $1.38 billion and $885.5 million, respectively, representing 17%, 15% and 12% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by approximately 3% from our estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $494.2 million and $318.3 million, respectively, in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for government chargebacks of $72.1 million and $53.5 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts: Balance at Beginning of Year Charged to Expense Deducted from Accruals Balance at End of Year Year ended December 31, 2011: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2011 sales $ $ 1,833,926 $ 1,298,281 $ 535,645 Activity related to sales prior to 2011 371,783 16,877 358,039 30,621 Total $ 371,783 $ 1,850,803 $ 1,656,320 $ 566,266 Year ended December 31, 2010: Government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities Activity related to 2010 sales $ $ 1,383,855 $ 1,012,874 $ 370,981 Activity related to sales prior to 2010 284,642 (8,573 ) 275,267 802 Total $ 284,642 $ 1,375,282 $ 1,288,141 $ 371,783 61 Table of Contents Intangible Assets In conjunction with business combinations that we have completed, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets, such as those related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates; the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.27 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $1.00 billion of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $266.2 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from Arresto and Calistoga. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan product, which we also acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and our lack of ongoing access and visibility into that partner future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate using a forecasted product sales approach. As of December 31, 2011, we had $796.7 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 62 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $136.0 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics which we had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to have no future use to us or other market participants. These charges related to the GS-9667, Adentri and tecadenoson programs and were recorded in R&D expense. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS-9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded $26.6 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CGI. These impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the Syk compound. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Prepaid Royalties We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls. We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory of $190.2 million and $219.5 million, respectively. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $29.3 million, $25.5 million and $29.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs). These costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 63 Table of Contents 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred CRO costs of $138.0 million, $99.0 million and $109.9 million, respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs. Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature. The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2011, 2010 and 2009 has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Complera/Eviplera, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Ranexa. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2011, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods. Tax Provision We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. 64 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $146.9 million and $126.5 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $120.6 million and $106.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. As of December 31, 2011, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around any of our uncertain tax positions. We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2003 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2002 and onwards. Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2008 and 2009 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions. Stock-based Compensation We measure all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on their relative fair values. Fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life. Fair value of our restricted stock units (RSUs) is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Our RSUs vest ratably on an annual basis over five years from the grant date for awards granted prior to 2011 and four years from the grant date for awards granted in 2011. We also grant performance-based restricted stock units which are valued using the Monte Carlo valuation method and vest upon the achievement of specified market and performance goals relative to a pre-determined peer group. The actual number of common shares ultimately issued is calculated by multiplying the number of performance units by a payout percentage ranging from 0% to 200%. Performance awards vest only when a committee (or subcommittee) of our Board has determined that we have achieved our specified market and performance goals. Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation expenses, related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance, is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in additional paid-in capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our Consolidated Statements of Income rather than through APIC. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized stock-based compensation expenses of $192.4 million, $200.0 million and $185.8 million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we 65 Table of Contents capitalized $8.6 million, $10.9 million and $11.4 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $2.0 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation costs was included in inventory, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $163.0 million related to unvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-average period of 2.4 years and we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $218.9 million related to RSUs which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of 3.3 years. Results of Operations Total Revenues We had total revenues of $8.39 billion in 2011, $7.95 billion in 2010 and $7.01 billion in 2009. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues and contract and other revenues. Increases in total revenues were driven by growth in product sales. Total product sales were $8.10 billion in 2011, an increase of 10% over total product sales of $7.39 billion in 2010, driven primarily by our antiviral franchise, resulting from the continued growth in sales of Atripla and Truvada. The increase in product sales also reflected sales growth in our non-antiviral products, primarily AmBisome, Ranexa, Letairis and Cayston, which reached $1.05 billion mark in 2011 compared to $853.0 million in 2010. In 2011, the increase in our product sales was partially offset by a decline in our Tamiflu royalties from Roche, due to declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Total product sales increased by 14% in 2010 compared to $6.47 billion in 2009, primarily driven by growth of Atripla and Truvada sales. Product sales in the United States increased 9% for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily driven by the continued sales growth in our antiviral franchise and the introduction of Complera, partially offset by the ongoing impact of U.S. healthcare reform. The increase also reflected sales growth in non-antiviral franchises. Ranexa sales contributed $315.0 million to our 2011 product sales, an increase of 34% compared to 2010. Letairis sales contributed $293.4 million to our 2011 product sales, an increase of 22% compared to 2010. Cayston contributed $77.5 million to our 2011 product sales, an increase of 84% compared to 2010. Product sales in Europe increased 9% for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily driven by sales growth in our antiviral franchise. This increase was partially offset by the impact of price reductions, due in part to austerity measures in certain European countries. Antiviral product sales in Europe totaled $2.71 billion in 2011, an increase of 9% compared to $2.49 billion in 2010, driven primarily by the sales of Atripla and Truvada. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our European product sales in 2011 compared to 2010. A significant percentage of our product sales continues to be denominated in foreign currencies and we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had a favorable impact of $21.4 million on our 2011 revenues compared to 2010 and an unfavorable impact of $93.7 million on our 2010 revenues compared to 2009. We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2012 as we expect to realize the full year impact related to our newest product Complera/Eviplera and expect to launch Quad in the United States in September 2012. 66 Table of Contents Product Sales The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Antiviral products: Atripla $ 3,224,518 10 % $ 2,926,579 23 % $ 2,382,113 Truvada 2,875,141 8 % 2,649,908 6 % 2,489,682 Viread 737,867 1 % 732,240 10 % 667,510 Hepsera 144,679 (28 )% 200,592 (26 )% 271,595 Complera/Eviplera 38,747 Emtriva 28,764 4 % 27,679 (1 )% 27,974 Total antiviral products 7,049,716 8 % 6,536,998 12 % 5,838,874 AmBisome 330,156 8 % 305,856 2 % 298,597 Letairis 293,426 22 % 240,279 31 % 183,949 Ranexa 320,004 33 % 239,832 83 % 131,062 Other 109,057 63 % 66,956 298 % 16,829 Total product sales $ 8,102,359 10 % $ 7,389,921 14 % $ 6,469,311 Antiviral Products Antiviral product sales increased by 8% in 2011 compared to 2010 and 12% in 2010 compared to 2009. Atripla Atripla sales increased by 10% in 2011 compared to 2010, driven primarily by sales growth in Europe and the United States. Atripla sales increased by 23% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth in the United States and Europe where we benefited from the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales include the efavirenz component which has a gross margin of zero. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $1.21 billion, $1.07 billion and $880.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 46%, 45% and 41% of our total antiviral product sales for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Truvada Truvada sales increased by 8% in 2011 compared to 2010, driven primarily by sales growth in Europe and the United States. Truvada sales increased by 6% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth in the United States and Europe. Truvada sales accounted for 41%, 41% and 43% of our total antiviral product sales for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Other Antiviral Products Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera, Complera/Eviplera and Emtriva, decreased by 1% in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a decrease in Hepsera sales, partially offset by the launch of Complera/Eviplera following its FDA approval in August 2011 and European Commission approval in November 2011. Other antiviral product sales decreased by 1% for 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily to decreases in Hepsera sales, partially offset by sales growth of Viread. AmBisome Sales of AmBisome increased by 8% in 2011 compared to 2010, driven primarily by sales growth in Latin America, Canada and Europe. Sales of AmBisome increased by 2% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth in certain markets outside of the United States, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign 67 Table of Contents currency exchange impact. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost. Letairis Sales of Letairis increased by 22% for 2011 compared to 2010 and 31% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth. New patient enrollments increased during 2011 following the FDA approval in March 2011 to remove liver toxicity language from the Boxed Warning. Ranexa Sales of Ranexa increased by 33% for 2011 compared to 2010 and 83% for 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales growth. Royalty Revenues The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Royalty revenues $ 268,827 -51 % $ 545,970 11 % $ 491,818 Historically, our most significant source of royalty revenues has been from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu sales are recognized by Roche. Royalty revenues declined 51% for 2011 compared to 2010, due primarily to lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Royalty revenues increased 11% for 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by increase in other royalty revenues, which include royalties from GSK for Hepsera, royalties from Astellas US LLC for Lexiscan and royalties from Japan Tobacco for Truvada, partially offset by the lower Tamiflu royalties from Roche. Tamiflu royalties since the second quarter of 2010 have been decreasing due to declining pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Tamiflu royalties from Roche contributed $75.5 million, $386.5 million and $392.7 million to total royalty revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross margin: 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Total product sales $ 8,102,359 10 % $ 7,389,921 14 % $ 6,469,311 Cost of goods sold $ 2,124,410 14 % $ 1,869,876 17 % $ 1,595,558 Product gross margin 74 % 75 % 75 % Our product gross margin for 2011 was 74%, a decrease of 1% compared to 2010, due primarily to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of Atripla that is paid to our partner. Our product gross margin for 2010 was 75%, consistent with our product gross margin for 2009. We expect our product gross margin in 2012 to be lower compared to 2011, due primarily to product mix as we expect a higher proportion of Atripla sales partially offset by an increase in product gross margin related to the full year impact of sales of Complera/Eviplera and the anticipated launch of Quad in September 2012. 68 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses We manage our R&D expenses by identifying the research and development activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other similar considerations. We continually review our R&D pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business. The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our R&D expenses (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Research and development $ 1,229,151 15 % $ 1,072,930 14 % $ 939,918 R&D expenses summarized above consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. The following table provides a breakout of R&D expenses by major cost type (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Clinical studies and outside services $ 570,302 $ 375,228 $ 413,487 Personnel expenses 412,463 384,488 364,505 Impairment and restructuring charges 26,716 135,800 2,200 Other 219,670 177,414 159,726 Total $ 1,229,151 $ 1,072,930 $ 939,918 R&D expenses for 2011 increased by $156.2 million, or 15%, compared to 2010, due primarily to a $195.1 million increase in clinical studies and outside services related to study progression in liver disease and HIV, new investments in oncology and inflammation and new in-license agreements, milestones and ongoing collaborations, a $28.0 million increase in personnel expenses due to higher headcount, an increase in other expenses including research and process development manufacturing to support clinical studies and the ongoing growth of our business, partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges. R&D expenses in 2010 increased by $133.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2009, due primarily to impairment charges of $136.0 million that we recorded related to IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, $23.5 million of clinical studies expenses related to increased HIV research activities and $16.1 million of compensation and benefits expenses. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS-9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants. The increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by $37.0 million due to the timing of certain clinical studies and $30.3 million of lower R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec. In 2012, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2011 levels due to continued investment in our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate that some of our product candidates will progress into more advanced phases of clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline. 69 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses (in thousands): 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,241,983 19 % $ 1,044,392 10 % $ 946,686 SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. SG&A expenses in 2011 increased by $197.6 million or 19%, compared to 2010, due primarily to increased contract, legal and other professional services of $86.8 million, pharmaceutical excise tax of $47.3 million resulting from U.S. healthcare reform, increased compensation and benefits expenses of $41.6 million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, promotional costs of $20.1 million driven by our expanding sales and marketing activities and bad debt provisions of $14.7 million associated with slower collections in southern European countries. SG&A expenses in 2010 increased by $97.7 million or 10%, compared to 2009, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $36.3 million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, increased contract and professional services expenses of $27.3 million driven primarily by our expanding sales and marketing activities and $18.1 million related to facilities and equipment expenses. In 2012, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2011 levels due to increased investments supporting the continued growth in all of our franchises and the increase in the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax. We believe we have the appropriate SG&A infrastructure to support the growth of our business in 2012. Restructuring Expenses During the second quarter of 2010, we approved and communicated a plan to close our research operations in Durham, North Carolina and consolidate our liver disease research activities in Foster City, California. We believe this plan will allow our employees to collaborate more effectively and further advance our programs in the liver disease area. In 2010, we recorded a total of $14.6 million and $10.4 million of restructuring expenses in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee severance and facilities-related expenses under this plan. In December 2010, we closed our operations in Durham. We have not incurred and do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan. During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies as a result of the CV Therapeutics acquisition by re-aligning our cardiovascular operations and eliminating redundancies. In 2010, we recorded $10.6 million and $3.4 million in restructuring expenses in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee severance, relocation, lease termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. In 2011, we recorded $6.7 million in restructuring expenses in SG&A related to other facilities-related expenses. Total costs incurred under this plan were $43.5 million and $29.1 million in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively. We have not incurred and do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan. Interest and Other Income, Net We recorded interest and other income, net, of $66.6 million, $60.3 million and $42.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in interest and other income, net, in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven primarily by a favorable net foreign currency exchange impact and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our hedging activities. The increase in interest and other income, net, in 2010 compared to 2009 was driven primarily by decreased costs related to our hedging activities. 70 Table of Contents We expect interest income to decrease in 2012 as we spent cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to partially fund our Pharmasset acquisition which closed in January 2012. Interest Expense Our interest expense was $205.4 million, $109.0 million and $69.7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes for $2.50 billion in July 2010, the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $1.00 billion in March 2011, the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for $3.70 billion in December 2011 and bridge financing associated with our acquisition of Pharmasset. This 2011 increase was partially offset by the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011, which had an aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million. The increase in interest expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to the issuance of our senior convertible notes for $2.50 billion in July 2010. We expect interest expense to increase in 2012 due to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, which included the $3.70 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.15 billion in bank debt we raised subsequent to December 31, 2011. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes was $861.9 million, $1.02 billion and $876.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. The 2011 effective tax rate of 23.6% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the non-deductible pharmaceutical excise tax. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested. The 2010 effective tax rate of 26.2% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. The 2009 effective tax rate of 25.0% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the revaluation of certain state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2011 as we issued senior unsecured notes for total net proceeds of $3.67 billion to fund our $11.1 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, which closed in January 2012. Below is additional information describing our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, working capital and primary sources and uses of cash. 71 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for each of, the periods presented (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 As of December 31: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 9,963,972 $ 5,318,071 $ 3,904,846 Working capital $ 11,403,995 $ 3,243,132 $ 2,940,927 Year Ended December 31: Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,639,010 $ 2,833,913 $ 3,080,054 Investing activities $ 3,589,845 $ (1,937,751 ) $ (2,215,900 ) Financing activities $ 1,763,569 $ (1,338,710 ) $ (1,051,438 ) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.96 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $4.65 billion or 87% from December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in 2011 for total net proceeds of $4.66 billion and cash provided by operations of $3.64 billion. This increase was partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 and $588.6 million used in our recent acquisitions of Arresto and Calistoga. The net proceeds related to our senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 were used to fund our acquisition of Pharmasset in January 2012. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5.32 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.41 billion or 36% from December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $2.83 billion and net proceeds of $2.46 billion from the issuance of our convertible senior notes in 2010, partially offset by $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Working Capital Working capital was $11.40 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase of $8.16 billion or 251% from working capital as of December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to: an increase of $7.80 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities resulting from the $3.67 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes in December 2011 and sales of long-term marketable securities in anticipation of the acquisition of Pharmasset; and a decrease of $644.8 million in the current portion of long-term debt and other obligations, net, due primarily to the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Working capital was $3.24 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $302.2 million or 10% from working capital as of December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to: an increase of $441.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities; an increase of $232.4 million in accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by increased product sales; and an increase of $152.0 million in inventories, due primarily to the purchase of efavirenz at its estimated net selling price from BMS. 72 Table of Contents This increase was partially offset by an increase of $640.8 million in the current portion of convertible senior notes, net and other long-term obligations, due to the reclassification of our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 to current liabilities. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $3.64 billion in 2011 primarily related to net income of $2.79 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $302.2 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $192.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $64.1 million of deferred income taxes and $220.3 million of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by $40.8 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $2.83 billion in 2010 primarily related to net income of $2.89 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $265.5 million of depreciation and amortization expenses, $200.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $136.0 million of IPR&D impairment expenses and $82.1 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans, partially offset by $680.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $81.6 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities of $3.08 billion in 2009 primarily related to net income of $2.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $180.7 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $148.4 million of amortization expenses. Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities in 2011 was $3.59 billion, consisting of a net proceeds of $4.31 billion related to the sales of marketable securities in connection with our acquisition of Pharmasset, partially offset by $588.6 million used in our acquisitions of Arresto and Calistoga and $131.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1.94 billion, driven by a net use of $1.78 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $91.0 million used in our acquisition of CGI and $61.9 million of capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $2.22 billion, driven by cash used for our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion (net of cash acquired), a net use of $738.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $230.1 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures in 2009 included the purchase of an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $1.76 billion, driven primarily by the issuance of $4.66 billion in senior unsecured notes, of which $3.67 billion was raised in December 2011 to partially fund the Pharmasset acquisition, net of issuance costs and $211.7 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. The cash proceeds were partially offset by $2.38 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, including commissions and $650.0 million used to repay our convertible senior notes due in May 2011. Cash used in financing activities in 2010 was $1.34 billion, driven primarily by the $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $362.6 million used to purchase note hedges related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2014 and May 2016. The cash outflows were partially offset by $2.46 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of such notes, $155.4 million in proceeds from the sale of warrants related to such notes and $221.2 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. 73 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $1.05 billion, driven primarily by the $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $222.7 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans. During 2011, we completed our May 2010, three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program at which time we initiated purchases under our January 2011, three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program. Under the completed program, we repurchased and retired a total of 135.5 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $36.89 per share. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under the repurchase program was $4.60 billion. Long-Term Debt We were eligible to borrow up to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans under an amended and restated credit agreement. The credit agreement also included a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2011, we had $4.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the $1.25 billion credit agreement. In January 2012, we fully repaid the outstanding obligations under this credit agreement, at which time this credit agreement was terminated. On January 12, 2012, in conjunction with our acquisition of Pharmasset, we entered into a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement), a $750.0 million short-term revolving credit facility credit agreement (the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.00 billion Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan Credit Agreement). We borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $2.15 billion as follows: $750.0 million under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, $400.0 million under the Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement and $1.00 billion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, upon the close of the acquisition. All three credit agreements contain customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. These loans will bear interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the applicable credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under any of these agreements in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement was inclusive of a $30.0 million swing line loan sub-facility and a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder shall be due and payable on January 12, 2017. The Short-Term Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder shall be due and payable on January 10, 2013; however, we may request that the maturity date be extended until January 9, 2014. All principal repayment installments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be due and payable as specified in the Term Loan Credit Agreement, with the final principal installment payment due and payable on January 12, 2015. In December 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $3.70 billion to partially fund our acquisition of Pharmasset. The notes will pay interest at fixed annual rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. Our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 matured and we repaid the aggregate principal balance of $650.0 million. We also paid $36.1 million in cash related to the conversion spread of our matured notes, which represent the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $36.1 million in cash from the related convertible note hedges. Warrants related to our convertible senior notes due in May 2011 expired in August 2011. 74 Table of Contents In March 2011, we issued senior unsecured notes due in April 2021 in a registered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $1.00 billion. The notes will pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.50%. We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: the commercial performance of our current and future products; the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; administrative expenses; the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations. We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Payments due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than one year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt (1) $ 10,811,866 $ 232,724 $ 3,102,973 $ 2,336,169 $ 5,140,000 Operating lease obligations 204,954 43,635 66,329 41,775 53,215 Capital commitments (2) 16,556 16,556 Purchase obligations (3)(4) 1,317,922 990,151 202,471 125,300 Clinical trials (5) 191,043 124,473 64,872 1,698 Total $ 12,542,341 $ 1,407,539 $ 3,436,645 $ 2,504,942 $ 5,193,215 (1) Long-term debt obligations include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 0.625%, 1.00% and 1.625% for our convertible senior notes due in May 2013, May 2014 and May 2016, respectively. Long-term debt obligations also include future interest payments based on fixed rates of 2.40%, 3.05%, 4.50% 4.40% and 5.65% for our senior unsecured notes due in December 2014, December 2016, April 2021, December 2021 and December 2041, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate carrying values of our convertible notes and senior unsecured notes were $2.92 billion and $4.68 billion, respectively. 75 Table of Contents (2) At December 31, 2011, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $16.6 million primarily relating to facilities improvement projects. (3) At December 31, 2011, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts. (4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. (5) At December 31, 2011, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts. We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $170.6 million as of December 31, 2011. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next 12 months as we do not expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around any of our uncertain tax positions. The unrecognized tax benefits were included in long-term income taxes payable and non-current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to its existing standard for fair value measurement to achieve common guidance between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, the amended standard revises certain requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosure around fair value measurement. It does not require additional fair value measurements and was not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Early adoption is not permitted. The adoption of these amendments will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to an existing standard for comprehensive income to make the presentation of items within other comprehensive income (OCI) more prominent. The updated standard prohibits the current presentation of OCI in the statement of stockholders equity and instead, provides public companies the option of presenting OCI in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate consecutive statements. Additionally, the update requires that reclassification adjustments be displayed on the face of the financial statements where OCI is reported. In December 2011, the FASB issued another update that indefinitely deferred the specific requirement of presenting reclassification adjustments out of OCI in both net income and OCI on the face of the financial statements. During the deferral period, the existing requirements for the presentation of reclassification adjustments must continue to be followed. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Upon adoption, the updated standard will impact the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements; however, it will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing. Entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. This guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 76 Table of Contents In December 2011, the FASB issued a new standard to address the disclosure requirements around offsetting financial and derivative instruments and their related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on a company financial position. The update requires companies to disclose both the net and gross amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities that are offset in the notes to the financial statements. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2013 and will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 77 Table of Contents
