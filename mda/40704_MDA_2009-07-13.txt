ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive food products and market these value-added products under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profits, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of segment operating profit and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in EPS; and on average, at least a 50 basis point annual increase in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009, our net sales grew 8 percent, total segment operating profit grew 10 percent, diluted EPS grew 2 percent, and our return on average total capital improved by 50 basis points. Diluted EPS for fiscal 2009 includes a $0.22 net loss from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions, a net gain of $0.11 related to divestitures in fiscal 2009, an $0.08 gain from a settlement with the insurance carrier covering our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina and a $0.15 charge associated with an unfavorable court decision on an uncertain tax matter. Net cash provided by operations totaled $1.8 billion in fiscal 2009, enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 10 percent from fiscal 2008 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases, which totaled $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. We also made significant capital investments totaling $563 million in fiscal 2009, an increase of 8 percent from fiscal 2008, to support future growth and productivity. These results met or exceeded our long-term targets. We achieved each of our five key operating objectives for fiscal 2009: We generated broad-based growth in net sales across our businesses. Each of our operating segments posted net sales gains in fiscal 2009. We generated 2 points of growth from volume and 8 points from net price realization and product mix, offset by 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. 16 Table of Contents Our cost savings initiatives helped to partially offset input cost inflation in fiscal 2009. We took steps to manage raw material costs, especially with significant commodity cost increases in fiscal 2009. We maintained our efforts on holistic margin management (HMM), which include cost-savings initiatives, marketing spending efficiencies, and profitable sales mix strategies in order to protect our margins, enabling us to reinvest in our brands through higher levels of consumer marketing spending. We invested a significant amount in media and other brand-building marketing programs, which contributed to net sales growth across our businesses. We partnered with customers, including traditional food retailers, new retail formats, and various away-from-home channels, in order to enhance shopper insights, introduce new products and extend our existing brands to new markets. We continued to develop our business in international markets. We focused on our core platforms of super premium ice cream, convenient meal solutions, and healthy snacking by introducing new products and investing in consumer spending. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2009 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. In fiscal 2010, our plans assume that world economic conditions will remain challenging, and that foreign currency exchange transaction and translation effects will reduce our reported net sales and earnings growth rates. Fiscal 2010 will be 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2009. We expect our net sales in fiscal 2010 to be comparable to fiscal 2009 as reported. We expect input cost inflation to moderate from fiscal 2009 levels, which together with savings from our HMM initiatives should lead to expanded margins. Our key operating objectives for fiscal 2010 also include a high single digit increase in consumer marketing support. We believe this support, coupled with product innovation and consumer spending investments made in fiscal 2009, will be a key factor in generating unit volume growth, as we believe it builds consumer loyalty, increases our market share, and defends against other branded, private-label and value offerings. Our plans for international include unit volume growth through investment in our brands in growing categories and growth opportunities through distribution gains and innovation. We will also focus on higher-margin, branded product lines within the most attractive foodservice customer channels. Our plans also call for $630 million of expenditures for capital projects and a significant amount of cash returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our long-term objective is to reduce outstanding shares by a net 2 percent per year. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in fiscal 2010, with a goal of reducing average diluted shares outstanding, but at a rate less than our 2 percent long-term objective. On June 29, 2009, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.88 per share. This represents a 9 percent compound annual growth rate in dividends from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2010. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2009 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For fiscal 2009, we reported diluted EPS of $3.80, up 2 percent from $3.71 per share earned in fiscal 2008. Earnings after tax were $1,304 million in fiscal 2009, up 1 percent from $1,295 million in fiscal 2008. 17 Table of Contents The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Contributions from volume growth (a) 2 pts Net price realization and mix 8 pts Foreign currency exchange -2 pts Net sales growth 8 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales for fiscal 2009 grew 8 percent to $14.7 billion, driven by 2 percentage points of volume growth, mainly in our U.S. Retail and International segments, and 8 percentage points of growth from net price realization and mix. This growth was offset by 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 contributed approximately 1.5 percentage points of net sales growth. Cost of sales was up $680 million in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008, while cost of sales as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Higher volume drove $90 million of the increase in cost of sales. Higher input costs and changes in mix increased cost of sales by $453 million. We also recorded a $119 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $57 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, we recorded $18 million of charges to cost of sales, primarily for depreciation associated with restructured assets. Cost of sales for fiscal 2008 also included $21 million of costs, including product write offs, logistics, and other costs, related to voluntary product recalls. Gross margin grew 7 percent in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008, as operating leverage, cost savings initiatives, and net price realization offset input cost inflation. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased by 10 basis points from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $329 million in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2008 was largely the result of a 17 percent increase in media and other consumer marketing spending consistent with our brand-building strategy, along with higher levels of compensation and benefits expense. We also recorded write downs of $35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009, compared to a net gain of $16 million in fiscal 2008. These higher costs were partially offset by a $41 million settlement with the insurance carrier covering our La Salte a pasta manufacturing plant in Argentina that was destroyed by fire. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased by 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009 we recorded a net divestiture gain of $85 million. We recorded a gain of $129 million related to the sale of our Pop Secret microwave popcorn product line. We recorded a $38 million loss on the sale of a portion of the assets of our frozen unbaked bread dough product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, including the discontinuation of our frozen dinner roll product line in our U.S. Retail segment that shared a divested facility. In addition, we recorded a $6 million loss on the sale of our bread concentrates product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Net interest for fiscal 2009 totaled $390 million, $32 million lower than fiscal 2008. Average interest-bearing instruments decreased $264 million leading to a $15 million decrease in net interest, while average interest rates decreased 20 basis points generating a $17 million decrease in net interest. Net interest includes preferred distributions paid on minority interests. The average interest rate on our total outstanding debt and minority interests was 5.6 percent in fiscal 2009 compared to 5.8 percent in fiscal 2008. 18 Table of Contents Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $42 million in fiscal 2009 as follows: Expense, in Millions Closure of Contagem, Brazil bread and pasta plant $ 16.8 Discontinuation of product line at Murfreesboro, Tennessee plant 8.3 Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 16.5 Total $ 41.6 In fiscal 2009, due to declining financial results, we approved the restructuring of our International segment business in Brazil. We discontinued the production and marketing of Forno De Minas cheese bread and Frescarini pasta brands in Brazil and closed our Contagem, Brazil manufacturing facility. These actions affected 556 employees in our Brazilian operations. Our other product lines in Brazil are not affected by the decision. As a result of this decision, we incurred a charge of $17 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, consisting primarily of $5 million of employee severance, an $11 million non-cash impairment charge to write down assets to their net realizable value, and $1 million of other costs associated with this restructuring action. Subsequent to the end of our Brazilian subsidiary fiscal year end of April 30, 2009, we sold all of the production assets and the Forno De Minas brand for proceeds of $6 million. We utilized the values of the production assets established as part of the sale to determine the fiscal 2009 impairment charge. We expect this restructuring action to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Due to declining net sales and to improve manufacturing capacity for other product lines, we decided to exit our U.S. Retail segment Perfect Portions refrigerated biscuits product line at our manufacturing facility in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. We recorded an $8 million non-cash impairment charge against long lived assets used for this product line. Our other product lines at Murfreesboro are not affected by the decision, and no employees were affected by this action, which we expect will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, we also incurred $17 million of incremental plant closure expenses related to previously announced restructuring activities, including $10 million for the remainder of our lease obligation at our previously closed facility in Trenton, Ontario. In fiscal 2009 we paid $10 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2009 and previous years. In fiscal 2010, we expect to incur a nominal amount of expense associated with our previously announced restructuring actions. Our consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 37.3 percent compared to 34.4 percent in fiscal 2008. The increase in the effective rate is primarily due to the effect of a 2009 U.S. appellate court decision that reversed a 2008 U.S. district court decision. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit of $31 million as a result of a favorable U.S. district court decision on an uncertain tax matter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court decision. As a result, we recorded $53 million (including interest) of income tax expense related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008. We expect to make cash tax and interest payments of approximately $32 million in connection with this matter. We are currently evaluating our options for appeal. The rate also increased in fiscal 2009 due to $15 million of tax expense related to nondeductible goodwill write-offs associated with our divestitures. Other items that decreased the 2009 effective income tax rate include a favorable California appeals court decision that resulted in the recognition of $10 million of tax benefits. In addition, we recognized $21 million of other tax benefits, primarily related to foreign tax credits and audit settlements. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $92 million in fiscal 2009, compared to $111 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 earnings were reduced by a $6 million deferred income tax valuation allowance. In fiscal 2008, earnings included $16 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) property in the United Kingdom offset by restructuring expenses of $8 million. Fiscal 2008 results also included $2 million for our share of a gain on the sale of the 8th Continent soymilk business. In fiscal 2009, net sales for CPW increased 2 19 Table of Contents percent. Volume growth of 4 percentage points, including growth in Russia, Middle East, Asia, and Latin America, and net price realization were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint venture in Japan increased 2 percent in fiscal 2009 as a result of favorable foreign exchange of 11 percentage points and positive net price realization, offset by a decrease in volume. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 3 million from fiscal 2008 primarily due to the repurchase of 20 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2009, offset by the issuance of 14 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2008 to settle a forward contract with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Lehman Brothers), the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises, the issuance of annual stock awards, the vesting of restricted stock units, and the issuance of shares to acquire Humm Foods. FISCAL 2009 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Cash and cash equivalents increased $89 million from fiscal 2008, as discussed in the Liquidity section below. Receivables decreased $128 million from fiscal 2008, as a result of foreign exchange translation and sales timing shifts. The allowance for doubtful accounts was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2008. Inventories decreased $20 million from fiscal 2008 due to a decrease in the values and levels of grain inventories, as well as a $24 million increase in the reserve for the excess of first in, first out (FIFO) inventory costs over last in, first out (LIFO) inventory costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher levels of finished goods. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $41 million, as commodity and foreign exchange derivative receivables decreased $46 million. Land, buildings, and equipment decreased $73 million, as capital expenditures of $563 million were partially offset by depreciation expense of $443 million. We also recorded $18 million of impairment charges associated with restructured facilities in Contagem, Brazil and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In addition, we sold facilities with book values of $84 million in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Bakersfield, California; Hazelton, Pennsylvania; Montreal, Canada; and Vinita, Oklahoma. Goodwill and other intangible assets decreased $153 million from fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreases from foreign currency translation of $134 million, divestitures of $42 million, and deferred tax adjustments of $45 million related to divestitures and changes in acquisition related income tax liabilities. These were partially offset by the acquisition of Humm Foods, which increased goodwill and other intangibles by $61 million. Other assets decreased $855 million from fiscal 2008, driven by a $915 million decrease in our pension asset following our annual update of assumptions and fiscal 2009 asset performance, offset by a $64 million increase in interest rate derivative receivables resulting from a decrease in interest rates. Accounts payable decreased $134 million to $803 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of lower vendor payables associated with inventories and construction in progress, as well as foreign exchange translation. Long-term debt, including current portion, and notes payable increased $76 million from fiscal 2008. We issued senior notes totaling $1.9 billion in fiscal 2009 that we used to repay a portion of our commercial paper. The current and noncurrent portions of deferred income taxes decreased $302 million, due to losses in our pension assets and the book versus tax treatment of certain inventories and investments. We also incurred $216 million of deferred income tax expense in fiscal 2009. Other current liabilities increased $242 million, driven by increases in accrued taxes of $101 million and a $28 million increase in consumer marketing accruals. We also had an increase in foreign exchange derivatives payable of $19 million. 20 Table of Contents Other liabilities increased $8 million, driven by an increase in accrued compensation benefits of $50 million and a $40 million increase in non-current interest derivatives payable, offset by a $88 million decrease in non-current taxes payable. Retained earnings increased $725 million, reflecting fiscal 2009 net earnings of $1,304 million less dividends paid of $580 million. Treasury stock increased $815 million due to $1,296 million of share repurchases, offset by $443 million related to stock based compensation plans and $39 million for shares issued for the acquisition of Humm Foods. Additional paid in capital increased $101 million due primarily to an increase from stock compensation activity and $16 million for shares issued in the acquisition of Humm Foods. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) decreased by $1,052 million after-tax, primarily driven by losses in our pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans of $1.2 billion. FISCAL 2008 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For fiscal 2008, we reported diluted EPS of $3.71, up 17 percent from $3.18 per share earned in fiscal 2007. Earnings after tax were $1,295 million in fiscal 2008, up 13 percent from $1,144 million in fiscal 2007. The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2008 vs. 2007 Contributions from volume growth (a) 3 pts Net price realization and mix 5 pts Foreign currency exchange 2 pts Net sales growth 10 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales for fiscal 2008 grew 10 percent to $13.7 billion, driven by 3 percentage points from volume growth, mainly in our U.S. Retail and International segments, and 5 percentage points of growth from net price realization and mix across many of our businesses. In addition, foreign currency exchange effects added 2 percentage points of growth. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we voluntarily recalled all pepperoni varieties of Totino and Jeno frozen pizza manufactured on or before October 30, 2007 due to potential contamination. We also voluntarily recalled one flavor of Progresso soup during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The frozen pizza and soup recalls did not significantly impact our net sales for fiscal 2008. Cost of sales was up $823 million in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007. Cost of sales as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2008 increased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2007. Higher volume drove $207 million of this increase. Higher input costs and changes in mix increased cost of sales by $633 million. We recorded net mark-to-market gains of $60 million related to derivatives on open commodity positions to mitigate input cost inflation, and a $3 million loss from the revaluation of certain grain inventories to market. We also recorded $18 million of charges to cost of sales, primarily for depreciation associated with restructured assets. Our La Salte a pasta manufacturing plant in Argentina was destroyed by a fire resulting in a loss of $1 million, net of insurance proceeds, from the write off of inventory and property, plant, and equipment, and severance expense related to this event. Cost of sales for fiscal 2008 also included $21 million of costs, including product write offs, logistics, and other costs, related to the voluntary recalls. Gross margin grew 9 percent in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007, driven by higher volume, cost savings initiatives, and net price realization. Gross margin as a percent of net sales declined 40 basis points from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This primarily reflects declines in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, where we took price increases designed to offset cost increases on a dollar basis, but gross margin as a percent of net sales declined. 21 Table of Contents SG&A expenses increased by $236 million in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2007 was largely the result of a 13 percent increase in media and other consumer marketing spending consistent with our brand-building strategy, $30 million more foreign exchange losses than the previous year, higher levels of compensation and benefits, a 7 percent increase in research and development expense supporting our innovation initiatives, and $9 million of costs associated with the remarketing of the Class A and Series B-1 Interests in our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiary. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2007. Net interest for fiscal 2008 totaled $422 million, $5 million lower than fiscal 2007. Average interest-bearing instruments increased $467 million leading to a $29 million increase in net interest, while average interest rates decreased 50 basis points generating a $34 million decrease in net interest. Net interest includes preferred distributions paid on minority interests. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $21 million in fiscal 2008 as follows: Expense (Income), in Millions Closure of Poplar, Wisconsin plant $ 2.7 Closure and sale of Allentown, Pennsylvania frozen waffle plant 9.4 Closure of leased Trenton, Ontario frozen dough plant 10.9 Restructuring of production scheduling and discontinuation of cake product line at Chanhassen, Minnesota plant 1.6 Gain on sale of previously closed Vallejo, California plant (7.1 ) Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 3.5 Total $ 21.0 During fiscal 2008, we approved a plan to transfer Old El Paso production from our Poplar, Wisconsin facility to other plants and to close the Poplar facility. This action to improve capacity utilization and reduce costs affected 113 employees at the Poplar facility, and resulted in a charge of $3 million consisting entirely of employee severance. Due to declining financial results, we decided to exit our frozen waffle product line (retail and foodservice) and to close our frozen waffle plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, affecting 111 employees. We recorded a $3 million charge for employee severance and a $6 million non-cash impairment charge against long-lived assets at the plant. We also completed an analysis of the viability of our Bakeries and Foodservice frozen dough facility in Trenton, Ontario, and closed the facility, affecting 470 employees. We recorded an $8 million charge for employee expenses and a $3 million charge for shutdown and decommissioning costs. We also restructured our production scheduling and discontinued our cake production line at our Chanhassen, Minnesota Bakeries and Foodservice plant. These actions affected 125 employees, and we recorded a $3 million charge for employee severance, partially offset by a $1 million gain from the sale of long-lived assets. All of the foregoing actions were completed in fiscal 2009. Finally, we recorded additional charges of $4 million primarily related to previously announced Bakeries and Foodservice segment restructuring actions, including employee severance for 38 employees, that were completed in fiscal 2008. In addition, during fiscal 2008 we recorded an $18 million non-cash charge related to depreciation associated with restructured assets at our plant in Trenton, Ontario and $1 million of inventory write offs at our plants in Chanhassen, Minnesota and Allentown, Pennsylvania. These charges are recorded in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items in our segment results. Our consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 34.4 percent compared to 34.3 percent for the same period of fiscal 2007. The 0.1 percentage point increase was the result of an increase in the state income tax rate due to more income in higher rate jurisdictions and lower foreign tax credits. These items were offset by a favorable U.S. district court decision on an uncertain tax matter that reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest by $31 million. As discussed above under the heading Fiscal 2009 Consolidated Results of Operations , this decision was reversed by a U.S. appellate court decision in fiscal 2009. 22 Table of Contents After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $111 million in fiscal 2008, compared to $73 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, net sales for CPW grew 23 percent driven by higher volume, key new product introductions including Oats & More in the United Kingdom and Nesquik Duo across a number of regions, favorable foreign currency effects, and the benefit of a full year of sales from the Uncle Tobys acquisition, which closed in July 2006. Our fiscal 2008 after-tax earnings from joint ventures was benefited by $16 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a CPW property in the United Kingdom offset by restructuring expenses of $8 million. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia increased 16 percent in fiscal 2008 as a result of favorable foreign exchange and introductory product shipments. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent soymilk business was sold. Our 50 percent share of the after-tax gain on the sale was $2 million. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 13 million from fiscal 2007 due to our repurchase of 24 million shares of stock during fiscal 2008, partially offset by the issuance of 14 million shares to settle a forward purchase contract with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers, the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises, the issuance of annual stock awards, and the vesting of restricted stock units. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Bakeries and Foodservice. The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007: Net Sales Percent of Percent of Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 U.S. Retail $ 10,052.1 68 % $ 9,072.0 66 % $ 8,491.3 68 % International 2,591.4 18 2,558.8 19 2,123.4 17 Bakeries and Foodservice 2,047.8 14 2,021.3 15 1,826.8 15 Total $ 14,691.3 100 % $ 13,652.1 100 % $ 12,441.5 100 % Segment Operating Profit Percent of Percent of Percent of Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Profit Profit Profit Profit Profit Profit Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 U.S. Retail $ 2,208.5 84 % $ 1,971.2 82 % $ 1,896.6 84 % International 261.4 10 268.9 11 215.7 10 Bakeries and Foodservice 171.0 6 165.4 7 147.8 6 Total $ 2,640.9 100 % $ 2,405.5 100 % $ 2,260.1 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. 23 Table of Contents U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our major product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including soup, granola bars, and cereal. The components of the changes in net sales are shown in the following table: Components of U.S. Retail Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Contributions from volume growth (a) 4 pts 3 pts Net price realization and mix 7 pts 4 pts Net sales growth 11 pts 7 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. In fiscal 2009, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $10.1 billion, up 11 percent from fiscal 2008. Net price realization and mix added 7 percentage points of growth and volume on a tonnage basis contributed 4 percentage points of growth. Net sales for this segment totaled $9.1 billion in fiscal 2008 and $8.5 billion in fiscal 2007. The growth in fiscal 2008 net sales was the result of a 4 percentage point benefit from net price realization and mix, as well as a 3 percentage point increase in volume in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007, led by strong growth in our grain snacks and yogurt businesses. All of our U.S. Retail divisions experienced net sales growth in fiscal 2009 as shown in the tables below: U.S. Retail Net Sales by Division Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 Big G $ 2,259.5 $ 2,028.0 $ 1,932.9 Meals 2,157.1 2,006.1 1,909.2 Pillsbury 1,869.8 1,673.4 1,591.4 Yoplait 1,468.9 1,293.1 1,170.7 Snacks 1,246.6 1,197.6 1,066.5 Baking Products 850.7 723.3 666.7 Small Planet Foods and Other 199.5 150.5 153.9 Total $ 10,052.1 $ 9,072.0 $ 8,491.3 24 Table of Contents U.S. Retail Change in Net Sales by Division Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Big G 11 % 5 % Meals 8 5 Pillsbury 12 5 Yoplait 14 10 Snacks 4 12 Baking Products 18 8 Small Planet Foods 30 6 Total 11 % 7 % In fiscal 2009, Big G cereals net sales increased 11 percent driven by growth across the portfolio, including gains on MultiGrain Cheerios , Honey Nut Cheerios , Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and the Fiber One cereals. Net sales for Meals grew 8 percent led by Helper dinner mixes, the new Macaroni Grill dinner mix line, and Green Giant frozen vegetables. Pillsbury net sales increased 12 percent led by Totino pizza and Pizza Rolls snacks, Pillsbury refrigerated dough products, and new Pillsbury Savorings frozen appetizers. Yoplait net sales grew 14 percent led by contributions from Yoplait Light . Net sales for Snacks increased 4 percent, as gains in grain snacks including Fiber One bars and Chex Mix more than offset the reduction in sales from the divestiture of Pop Secret this year. Baking Products net sales grew 18 percent reflecting gains in Betty Crocker dessert mixes, Bisquick baking mix, and Gold Medal flour. Net sales for Small Planet Foods grew 30 percent including contributions from the L rabar product line acquired in fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2008, Big G cereals net sales grew 5 percent, driven by growth in core brands including Cheerios varieties and Fiber One cereals. Net sales for Meals grew by 5 percent led by Progresso ready-to-serve soups . Pillsbury net sales increased 5 percent led by Totino frozen pizza and hot snacks and Pillsbury refrigerated baked goods. Yoplait net sales grew 10 percent due to growth on Yoplait Light yogurt and new products including Yo-Plus and Fiber One yogurt.

Segment operating profit of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009 improved $237 million, or 12 percent, over fiscal 2008. Net price realization and mix increased segment operating profit by $596 million, and volume growth increased segment operating profit by $146 million. These were partially offset by increased supply chain input costs of $338 million, a 19 percent increase in consumer marketing expense consistent with our brand-building strategy, and higher administrative costs. In fiscal 2008, voluntary product recalls reduced segment operating profit by $24 million. Segment operating profit of $2.0 billion in fiscal 2008 improved $75 million, or 4 percent, over fiscal 2007. Net price realization and mix increased segment operating profit by $317 million, and volume growth increased segment operating profit by $95 million. These were offset by increased supply chain input costs of $181 million, higher administrative costs, and a 12 percent increase in consumer marketing expense consistent with our brand-building strategy. Voluntary product recalls reduced segment operating profit by $24 million. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT In Canada, our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, and grain, fruit and savory snacks.

For fiscal 2009, net sales for our International segment were $2,591 million, up 1 percent from fiscal 2008. This growth was driven by 9 percentage points of net price realization and mix and 1 percentage point of volume growth, offset by 9 percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Net sales totaled $2,559 million in fiscal 2008, up 20 percent from $2,123 million in fiscal 2007. The growth in fiscal 2008 was driven mainly by 9 percentage points of favorable foreign exchange, in addition to a 6 percentage point increase in volume growth and a 5 percentage point increase in net price realization and mix. Net sales growth for our International segment by geographic region is shown in the following tables: International Net Sales by Geographic Region Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 Europe $ 857.8 $ 898.5 $ 756.3 Canada 651.8 697.0 610.4 Asia/Pacific 635.8 577.4 462.0 Latin America 446.0 385.9 294.7 Total $ 2,591.4 $ 2,558.8 $ 2,123.4 International Change in Net Sales by Geographic Region Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Europe -5 % 19 % Canada -6 14 Asia/Pacific 10 25 Latin America 16 31 Total 1 % 20 % In fiscal 2009, net sales in Europe decreased by 5 percent driven by 9 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by net sales growth of Old El Paso across Europe and dough products in the United Kingdom. Net sales in Canada decreased 6 percent due to 13 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by growth from cereal products and Fiber One bars. Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased by 10 percent, including sales growth for H agen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry brands in China, and increased sales of Old El Paso and Latina in Australia. Latin America net sales increased 16 percent due to net price realization and the sales volume recovery in Argentina after a fire destroyed our La Salte a manufacturing facility in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, net sales in Europe increased 19 percent reflecting performance from Old El Paso and H agen-Dazs in the United Kingdom. Continued success from the launch of Nature Valley granola bars in several European markets and favorable foreign exchange also contributed to the region growth. Net sales in Canada increased 14 percent including favorable foreign exchange. In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales increased 25 percent led by 26 Table of Contents double-digit growth for H agen-Dazs ice cream and Wanchai Ferry dumplings and meal kits in China. In Latin America, net sales increased 31 percent led by Diablitos canned meat spread in Venezuela and net price realization in other countries, partially offset by lost sales following our plant fire in Argentina. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2009 declined 3 percent to $261 million from $269 million in the same period a year ago driven by a 14 percentage point decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Increases in net price realization and mix and volume growth offset increases in supply chain input costs of $16 million and a 3 percent increase in consumer marketing expense. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2008 grew to $269 million, up 25 percent from fiscal 2007, with foreign currency exchange contributing 9 percentage points of that growth. Segment operating profit increased by $38 million from higher volumes. Net price realization and mix more than offset higher supply chain input costs, a 22 percent increase in consumer marketing expense, and administrative cost increases. BAKERIES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment we sell branded ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, dinner and side dish products, refrigerated and soft-serve frozen yogurt, frozen dough products, branded baking mixes, and custom food items. Our customers include foodservice distributors and operators, convenience stores, vending machine operators, quick service and other restaurant operators, and business and school cafeterias in the United States and Canada. In addition, we market mixes and unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products throughout the United States and Canada to retail, supermarket, and wholesale bakeries.

For fiscal 2009, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 1 percent to $2,048 million. The increase in fiscal 2009 was driven by 7 percentage points of net price realization and mix. This was offset by a 6 percentage point decrease in volume, mainly in the distributors and restaurants customer channel, including the effects of divested product lines. For fiscal 2008, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased to $2,021 million. The growth in fiscal 2008 net sales was driven by 14 percentage points of benefit from net price realization and mix, as we took price increases to offset higher supply chain input costs. This was partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline in volume. Net sales growth for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment by customer segment is shown in the following tables: Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales by Customer Segment Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 Distributors and restaurants $ 890.1 $ 902.0 $ 864.8 Bakery channels 950.8 927.8 780.5 Convenience stores and vending 206.9 191.5 181.5 Total $ 2,047.8 $ 2,021.3 $ 1,826.8 27 Table of Contents Bakeries and Foodservice Change in Net Sales by Customer Segment Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Distributors and restaurants -1 % 4 % Bakery channels 2 19 Convenience stores and vending 8 6 Total 1 % 11 % In fiscal 2009, segment operating profits were $171 million, up 3 percent from $165 million in fiscal 2008. The increase was due to margin expansion and HMM efforts which offset significant volume declines and lower grain merchandising activities. Segment operating profits were $165 million in fiscal 2008, up 12 percent from $148 million in fiscal 2007. The increase for the year was driven by grain merchandising activities and benefits from prior restructuring activities. Net price realization and mix offset higher supply chain input costs and a decrease in volume. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include variances to planned corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, all stock compensation costs, annual contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2009, unallocated corporate items totaled $361 million of expense compared to $157 million of expense for the same period last year. The $204 million increase in expense was driven primarily by a $176 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuations of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. We also recorded write downs of $35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009, compared to a net gain of $16 million in fiscal 2008, and a $16 million increase in contributions to the General Mills Foundation, offset by a fiscal 2009 gain from an insurance settlement as discussed above under the heading Fiscal 2009 Consolidated Results of Operations . Unallocated corporate items were $157 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $163 million in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we recognized a net gain of $57 million related to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and a previously deferred gain of $11 million on the sale of a corporate investment. These gains were offset by $26 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, $18 million of charges to cost of sales, primarily depreciation on long-lived assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions, and $9 million of expense related to the remarketing of minority interests in our GMC subsidiary. JOINT VENTURES In addition to our consolidated operations, we participate in several joint ventures. International Joint Ventures We have a 50 percent equity interest in CPW, which manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries and republics outside the United States and Canada. CPW also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United Kingdom. We have guaranteed a portion of CPW debt and its pension obligation in the United Kingdom. Results from our CPW joint venture are reported for the 12 months ended March 31. On July 14, 2006, CPW acquired the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia for $386 million. We funded our 50 percent share of the purchase price by making additional advances to and equity contributions in CPW totaling $135 million (classified as investments in affiliates, net on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) and by acquiring a 50 percent undivided interest in certain intellectual property for $58 million (classified as acquisitions on 28 Table of Contents the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). We funded the advances to and our equity contribution in CPW from cash generated by our international operations, including our international joint ventures. We also have a 50 percent equity interest in H agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. This joint venture manufactures, distributes, and markets H agen-Dazs ice cream products and frozen novelties. In fiscal 2007, we changed the reporting period for this joint venture. Accordingly, fiscal 2007 includes only 11 months of results from this joint venture compared to 12 months in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Domestic Joint Venture During fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent soy milk business was sold. We recorded a $2 million gain in fiscal 2008 reflecting our 50 percent share of the after-tax gain on the sale. We will record approximately $1 million of additional gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 if certain conditions related to the sale are satisfied. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings decreased from $111 million in fiscal 2008 to $92 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, earnings were reduced by a $6 million deferred income tax valuation allowance. In fiscal 2008, earnings included $16 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a CPW property in the United Kingdom offset by restructuring expenses of $8 million. Also, fiscal 2008 results included $2 million for our share of a gain on the sale of the 8th Continent soymilk business. Our after-tax share of CPW restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs was as follows: Fiscal Year Expense (Income), in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Gain on sale of property $ $ (15.9 ) $ Depreciation associated with restructured assets 4.5 8.2 Other charges resulting from restructuring actions 3.2 Total $ $ (8.2 ) $ 8.2 Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $73 million in fiscal 2007 to $111 million in fiscal 2008. This growth was largely driven by strong sales growth, favorable foreign exchange, and our share of the gain from the sale of a CPW property. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 CPW 2 % 23 % H agen-Dazs (12 months in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and 11 months in fiscal 2007 ) 2 16 Joint Ventures 2 % 21 % For fiscal 2009, CPW net sales grew by 2 percent reflecting higher volume and net price realization, slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint venture increased 2 percent from fiscal 2008 as a result of favorable foreign exchange of 11 percentage points and positive net price realization, offset by a decrease in volume. For fiscal 2008, CPW net sales grew by 23 percent reflecting higher volume, key new product introductions including Oats & More in the United Kingdom and Nesquik Duo across a number of regions, favorable foreign currency effects, and the benefit of a full year of sales from the fiscal 2007 Uncle Tobys acquisition. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint venture increased 16 percent from fiscal 2007, as a result of favorable foreign exchange and introductory product shipments. 29 Table of Contents Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Advances to joint ventures $ (14.2 ) $ (20.6 ) $ (141.4 ) Repayments of advances 22.4 95.8 38.0 Dividends received 68.5 108.7 45.2 IMPACT OF INFLATION We have experienced high levels of input cost inflation since fiscal 2006. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of significant input cost inflation, primarily from commodities and energy inputs. We expect the rate of inflation to moderate in fiscal 2010. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $5.3 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions. Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 Net earnings $ 1,304.4 $ 1,294.7 $ 1,143.9 Depreciation and amortization 453.6 459.2 417.8 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (91.9 ) (110.8 ) (72.7 ) Stock-based compensation 117.7 133.2 127.1 Deferred income taxes 215.8 98.1 26.0 Tax benefit on exercised options (89.1 ) (55.7 ) (73.1 ) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 68.5 108.7 45.2 Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (220.3 ) (14.2 ) (60.6 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan (income) expense (27.5 ) 5.5 5.6 Divestitures (gain), net (84.9 ) Gain on insurance settlement (41.3 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs (income) 31.3 (1.7 ) 39.1 Changes in current assets and liabilities 176.9 (126.7 ) 149.1 Other, net 15.0 (60.4 ) 3.8 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,828.2 $ 1,729.9 $ 1,751.2 In fiscal 2009, our operations generated $1,828 million of cash compared to $1,730 million in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting a $304 million reduction in the use of working capital in fiscal 2009. Inventories used $137 million less cash and accounts payable used $242 million more cash year over year due to decreases in grain prices and grain inventory levels in fiscal 2009. Other current liabilities were a $136 million increased source of cash, primarily due to lower cash taxes paid and higher consumer marketing accruals. Other current assets provided $96 million more cash, primarily due to changes in currency and commodity derivative receivables. Accounts receivable provided $176 million more cash driven by sales timing shifts and improvements in collections in certain international 30 Table of Contents markets. The favorable change in working capital was offset by a $200 million voluntary contribution made to our principal domestic pension plans. We strive to grow a key measure, core working capital, at or below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2009, core working capital declined 1 percent, compared to net sales growth of 8 percent, largely driven by a decrease in inventory in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, core working capital grew 12 percent, more than net sales growth of 10 percent, and in fiscal 2007, core working capital grew 4 percent, less than net sales growth of 6 percent. Our cash flows from operations decreased $21 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 as a $151 million increase in net earnings and a $72 million effect of changes in deferred income taxes were more than offset by the $276 million increase in the use of cash for working capital. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (562.6 ) $ (522.0 ) $ (460.2 ) Acquisitions 0.6 (83.4 ) Investments in affiliates, net 5.9 64.6 (100.5 ) Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 4.1 25.9 13.8 Proceeds from divestitures of product lines 244.7 13.5 Proceeds from insurance settlement 41.3 Other, net (22.3 ) (11.5 ) 19.7 Net cash used by investing activities $ (288.9 ) $ (442.4 ) $ (597.1 ) In fiscal 2009, cash used by investing activities decreased by $154 million from fiscal 2008 primarily due to proceeds of $245 million from the sale of certain product lines. We also received insurance proceeds of $41 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 from the settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss at our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina. These proceeds will offset the capital expenditures required to replace the manufacturing facility that was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 increased $41 million from the same period last year as we increased manufacturing capacity for our cereal, snack bars, soup, and yogurt products. In fiscal 2008, cash used by investing activities decreased by $155 million from fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we sold our former production facilities in Vallejo, California and Allentown, Pennsylvania, while in fiscal 2007 we sold our frozen pie product line, including a plant in Rochester, New York, and our par-baked bread product line, including plants in Chelsea, Massachusetts and Tempe, Arizona. These sale proceeds were offset by the funding of our share of CPW acquisition of the Uncle Tobys cereal business in Australia (reflected in acquisitions and investments in affiliates, net), and our acquisition of Saxby Bros. Limited and our master franchisee of H agen-Dazs shops in Greece. In addition, capital investment for land, buildings, and equipment increased by $62 million, as we continued to increase manufacturing capacity for our snack bars and yogurt products and began consolidating manufacturing for our Old El Paso product line. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $630 million in fiscal 2010, including initiatives that will: increase manufacturing capacity for Yoplait yogurt, Totino Pizza Rolls pizza snacks , and cereals; continue productivity increases throughout the supply chain; rebuild the pasta plant in Argentina that was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008; and expand International production capacity for Wanchai Ferry products and Old El Paso tortillas. 31 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2009 2008 2007 Change in notes payable $ (1,390.5 ) $ 946.6 $ (280.4 ) Issuance of long-term debt 1,850.0 1,450.0 2,650.0 Payment of long-term debt (370.3 ) (1,623.4 ) (2,323.2 ) Settlement of Lehman Brothers forward purchase contract 750.0 Repurchase of Series B-1 limited membership interests in GMC (843.0 ) Repurchase of General Mills Capital, Inc. preferred stock (150.0 ) Proceeds from sale of Class A limited membership interests in GMC 92.3 Proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 305.2 191.4 317.4 Tax benefit on exercised options 89.1 55.7 73.1 Purchases of common stock for treasury (1,296.4 ) (1,432.4 ) (1,320.7 ) Dividends paid (579.5 ) (529.7 ) (505.2 ) Other, net (12.1 ) (0.5 ) (9.1 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (1,404.5 ) $ (1,093.0 ) $ (1,398.1 ) Net cash used by financing activities increased by $312 million in fiscal 2009. In January 2009, we sold $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 5.65 percent notes due 2019. In August 2008, we sold $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.25 percent notes due 2013. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make-whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. On October 15, 2007, we settled the forward contract established with Lehman Brothers in October 2004 in conjunction with the issuance by Lehman Brothers of $750 million of notes that were mandatorily exchangeable for shares of our common stock. In settlement of that forward contract, we issued 14 million shares of our common stock and received $750 million in cash from Lehman Brothers. We used the cash to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. On August 7, 2007, we repurchased for a net amount of $843 million all of the outstanding Series B-1 Interests in GMC as part of a required remarketing of those interests. The purchase price reflected the Series B-1 Interests original capital account balance of $835 million and $8 million of capital account appreciation attributable and paid to the third party holder of the Series B-1 Interests. The capital appreciation paid to the third party holder of the Series B-1 Interests was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, a component of stockholders equity, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and reduced net earnings available to common stockholders in our basic and diluted EPS calculations. In April 2007, we issued $1.15 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes. In April 2008, holders of $1.14 billion of those notes tendered them to us for repurchase. In April 2009, we repurchased all of the remaining outstanding notes. We issued commercial paper to fund the repurchases. We and the third party holder of all of GMC outstanding Class A limited membership interests (Class A Interests) agreed to reset, effective on June 28, 2007, the preferred rate of return applicable to the Class A Interests to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points. On June 28, 2007, we sold $92 million of additional Class A Interests to the same third party. There was no gain or loss associated with these transactions. As of May 31, 2009, the carrying value of all outstanding Class A Interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $242 million, and the capital account balance of the Class A Interests upon which preferred distributions are calculated was $248 million. 32 Table of Contents On June 28, 2007, we repurchased for $150 million all of the outstanding Series A preferred stock of our subsidiary General Mills Capital, Inc. using proceeds from the sale of the Class A Interests and commercial paper. There was no gain or loss associated with this repurchase. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 20 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,296 million. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 24 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,368 million. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 25 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,385 million, of which $64 million settled after the end of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 75 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. Dividends paid in fiscal 2009 totaled $580 million, or $1.72 per share, a 10 percent per share increase from fiscal 2008. Dividends paid in fiscal 2008 totaled $530 million, or $1.57 per share, a 9 percent per share increase from fiscal 2007 dividends of $1.44 per share. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase from $0.43 per share to $0.47 per share effective with the dividend payable on August 1, 2009. CAPITAL RESOURCES Total capital consisted of the following: May 31, May 25, In Millions 2009 2008 Notes payable $ 812.2 $ 2,208.8 Current portion of long-term debt 508.5 442.0 Long-term debt 5,754.8 4,348.7 Total debt 7,075.5 6,999.5 Minority interests 242.3 242.3 Stockholders equity 5,174.7 6,215.8 Total capital $ 12,492.5 $ 13,457.6 The decline in total capital from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to actuarial losses on our defined benefit plans recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The following table details the fee-paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May 31, 2009: In Billions Amount Credit facility expiring: October 2010 $ 1.1 October 2012 1.8 Total committed credit facilities 2.9 Uncommitted credit facilities 0.4 Total committed and uncommitted credit facilities $ 3.3 To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding short-term borrowings. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We issue commercial paper in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.9 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines, consisting of a $1.8 billion facility expiring in October 2012 and a $1.1 billion facility expiring in October 2010. We also have $0.4 billion in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations. As of May 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and $135 million 33 Table of Contents was drawn on the uncommitted lines. The credit facilities contain several covenants with which we were in compliance as of May 31, 2009, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5. Certain of our long-term debt agreements and our minority interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $508 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 31, 2009, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 88 percent in fixed-rate and 12 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 66 percent in fixed-rate and 34 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 25, 2008. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages was driven by the refinancing of $1.9 billion of commercial paper with fixed-rate notes during fiscal 2009. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) covering the sale of debt securities. The shelf registration statement will expire in December 2011. Growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Return on average total capital increased from 11.8 percent in fiscal 2008 to 12.3 percent in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased earnings and improvements in core working capital. We also believe important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2009 was 5.31 compared to 4.87 in fiscal 2008. The measure increased from fiscal 2008 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased by $127 million and fixed charges decreased by $31 million. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 1.1 points to 25.8 percent in fiscal 2009, driven by a higher rate of increase in cash flows from operations than the rate of increase in our year-end debt balance. Currently, Standard and Poor (S&P) has ratings of BBB+ on our long-term debt and A-2 on our commercial paper. Moody Investors Services (Moody s) has ratings of Baa1 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) rates our long-term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F-2. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In April 2002, we contributed assets with an aggregate fair market value of $4.2 billion to our subsidiary GMC. The contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of Big G cereals, Progresso soups, and Old El Paso products in the United States. In exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We continue to hold the entire managing membership interest, and therefore direct the operations of GMC. Other than the right to consent to certain actions, holders of the limited preferred membership interests do not participate in the management of GMC. We currently hold all interests in GMC other than the Class A Interests. The holder of the Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points, to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $248 million). The Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of GMC requires that the preferred return rate of the Class A Interests be adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the Class A Interest holder and GMC, or through a remarketing auction. The next remarketing is scheduled to occur in June 2012 and thereafter in five-year intervals. Upon a failed remarketing, the preferred return rate over three-month LIBOR will be increased by 75 basis points until the next remarketing, which will occur in 3 month intervals until a successful remarketing occurs or the managing member purchases the Class A Interests. The managing member may at any time elect to purchase all of the Class A Interests for an amount equal to the holder capital account balance (as adjusted in a mark-to-market valuation), plus any accrued but unpaid preferred returns and the prescribed make-whole amount. 34 Table of Contents Holders of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the Class A Interests, GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB- by S&P, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests as a result of GMC failure to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the Class A Interests. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of GMC are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The return to the third party investor is reflected in net interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The third party investor interests in GMC are classified as minority interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed in the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements section below, we expect our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment to ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160), in fiscal 2010 to change the financial statement presentation of these interests in GMC. As discussed above, we may exercise our option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third party investor capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 31, 2009, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $654 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $282 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $351 million as of May 31, 2009. As of May 31, 2009, we had invested in three variable interest entities (VIEs). We have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. We are the primary beneficiary (PB) and have consolidated this entity. This entity had property and equipment with a carrying value of $25 million and long-term debt of $26 million as of May 31, 2009. The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating this entity do not represent additional claims on our general assets. We also have an interest in a contract manufacturer in Greece that is a VIE. Although we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity because it is not practical to do so and it is not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 31, 2009. This entity had assets of $5 million and liabilities of $1 million as of May 31, 2009. We are not the PB of the remaining VIE. Our maximum exposure to loss from the three VIEs is limited to the $26 million of long-term debt of the contract manufacturer in Geneva, Illinois and our $2 million equity investment in the VIE of which we are not the PB. We have not provided financial or other support to these VIEs during the current period nor are there arrangements related to these VIEs that could require us to provide financial support in the future. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of Pension Protection Act (PPA). The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2009 on a phased-in basis. Although not required under the provisions of the PPA, we voluntarily contributed $200 million to our principal defined benefit plans in fiscal 2009. We do not expect to make any contributions to our domestic plans in fiscal 2010. Actual fiscal 2010 contributions could exceed our current projections, and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, interest rates, and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2015 and In Millions Total 2010 2011 - 12 2013 - 14 Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 6,275.3 $ 504.3 $ 1,356.9 $ 1,513.8 $ 2,900.3 Accrued interest 182.1 182.1 Operating leases (b) 351.3 87.6 131.8 75.0 56.9 Capital leases 15.9 5.0 6.6 4.3 Purchase obligations (c) 2,289.4 1,791.1 368.3 82.1 47.9 Total contractual obligations 9,114.0 2,570.1 1,863.6 1,675.2 3,005.1 Other long-term obligations (d) 1,280.6 Total long-term obligations $ 10,394.6 $ 2,570.1 $ 1,863.6 $ 1,675.2 $ 3,005.1 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $14 million for capital leases or $26 million for unamortized bond premiums or discounts. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps with a payable position to the counterparty was $260 million as of May 31, 2009, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for uncertain income tax positions, accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $19 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $13 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2010. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2010. As of May 31, 2009, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was $720 million as of the end of our fiscal year. We expect to pay approximately $157 million of tax liabilities and accrued interest in the next 12 months, including a portion of our potential liability for the matter resolved by the U.S. Court of Appeals discussed within this MD&A. While fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of this and other tax audit outcomes. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution 36 Table of Contents of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $474 million as of May 31, 2009, and $446 million as of May 25, 2008. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly intangible assets associated with the Pillsbury, Totino s, Progresso, Green Giant , Old El Paso, and H agen-Dazs brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2009 assessment of our brand intangibles as of December 1, 2008. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included: projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. As of our assessment date, there was no impairment of these intangibles, and the fair value of the Pillsbury brand was more than 10 percent greater than its carrying value, up from an excess of 3 percent as of the fiscal 2008 assessment. As of May 31, 2009, we had $10.4 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. 37 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and dividend yield. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. For the fiscal 2009 grants, we have excluded historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior, primarily because volatility driven by our acquisition of The Pillsbury Company (Pillsbury) in fiscal 2002 does not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2009 volatility assumption would increase the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2009 option awards by 5 percent. Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would change the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent. Our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in line with earnings, resulting in a constant dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The estimated weighted-average fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 9.41 $ 10.55 $ 10.74 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 4.4 % 5.1 % 5.3 % Expected term 8.5 years 8.5 years 8.0 years Expected volatility 16.1 % 15.6 % 19.7 % Dividend yield 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.8 % To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit ) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset 38 Table of Contents against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. Prior to fiscal 2008, our policy was to establish liabilities that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. The effects of final resolution, if any, were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. Annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. We are no longer subject to United States federal examinations by the IRS for fiscal years before 2002. The IRS has concluded its field examination of our 2006 and prior federal tax years, which resulted in payments of $18 million in fiscal 2009 and $56 million in fiscal 2008 to cover the additional U.S. income tax liability plus interest related to adjustments during these audit cycles. The IRS also proposed additional adjustments for the fiscal 2002 to 2006 audit cycles related to the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of our sale of minority interests in our GMC subsidiary. The IRS has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefits associated with this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending our positions. We have appealed the results of the IRS field examinations to the IRS Appeals Division. Our potential liability for this matter is significant. We have determined that a portion of this matter should be included as a tax liability and is accordingly included in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. The IRS initiated its audit of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 tax years during fiscal 2009. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit of $31 million as a result of a favorable U.S. district court decision on an uncertain tax matter. In the third quarter of 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court decision. As a result, we recorded $53 million (including interest) of income tax expense related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008. We are currently evaluating our options for appeal. If the appellate court decision is not overturned, we would expect to make cash tax and interest payments of approximately $32 million in connection with this matter. As of May 31, 2009, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was $720 million as of the end of our fiscal year. We expect to pay approximately $157 million of tax liabilities and accrued interest in the next 12 months, including a portion of our potential liability for the matter resolved by the U.S. Court of Appeals discussed in the preceding paragraph. While fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are currently under examination by the IRS, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of this and other tax audit outcomes. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years. Currently, several state examinations are in progress. The Canada Revenue Agency is conducting an audit of our income tax returns in Canada for fiscal years 2003 (which is 39 Table of Contents our earliest tax year still open for examination) through 2005. We do not anticipate that any United States state tax or Canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. Defined Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic, Canadian, and United Kingdom employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2009, and are not required to make similar contributions in fiscal 2010. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2009. Postemployment Benefit Plans Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were a 25 percent loss in the 1 year period ended May 31, 2009 and returns of 5 percent, 6 percent, 9 percent, and 9 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 31, 2009. 40 Table of Contents Our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States have an expected return on plan assets of 9.6 percent. During fiscal 2007, we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other postretirement plans in the United States based on costs associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 9.55 percent for fiscal 2009, 9.56 percent for fiscal 2008, and 9.57 percent for fiscal 2007. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $22 million for fiscal 2010. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. Those same discount rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the top quartile of AA-rated corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Weighted-Average Discount Rates Defined Other Benefit Postretirement Postemployment Pension Benefit Benefit Plans Plans Plans Obligation as of May 31, 2009, and fiscal 2010 expense 7.49 % 7.45 % 7.06 % Obligation as of May 25, 2008, and fiscal 2009 expense 6.88 % 6.90 % 6.64 % Fiscal 2008 expense 6.18 % 6.15 % 6.05 % Lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2010 by approximately $25 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 9.5 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 9.0 percent for retirees under age 65. These rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2018 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. 41 Table of Contents A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: One One Percentage Percentage Point Point In Millions Increase Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2010 $ 7.2 $ (6.3 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 31, 2009 75.8 (66.9 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2009, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income of $4 million compared to $19 million of expense in fiscal 2008 and $36 million of expense in fiscal 2007. As of May 31, 2009, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.0 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $130 million on our postretirement benefit plans, mainly as the result of declines in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. We use the Retirement Plans (RP) 2000 Mortality Table projected forward to our plans measurement dates for calculating the year-end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care trend rates, and various other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 08-6, Equity Method Accounting Considerations (EITF 08-6). EITF 08-6 addresses the impact of the issuance of SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 on accounting for equity method investments. EITF 08-6 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We do not expect EITF 08-6 to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In June 2008, the FASB approved the issuance of EITF No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity Own Stock (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 defines when adjustment features within contracts are considered to be equity-indexed and will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We do not expect EITF 07-5 to have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1). FSP EITF 03-6-1 provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Upon adoption, we are required to retrospectively adjust our EPS data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of FSP EITF 03-6-1. We expect the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 to have an immaterial impact on our basic and diluted EPS. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) Accounting Principles Board (APB) 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial 42 Table of Contents Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1). FSP APB 14-1 requires issuers to account separately for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Upon adoption, we are required to apply this accounting retrospectively. We expect the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 to have no impact on our financial statements for fiscal 2009 and 2008, and an immaterial impact on our financial statements for fiscal 2007. In April 2008, the FASB finalized FSP No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP 142-3). This position amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . FSP 142-3 applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and both intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. This position is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We do not expect FSP 142-3 to have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS 157 by FSP FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP FAS 157-2). FSP FAS 157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after February 15, 2008. As disclosed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, we adopted the required provisions of SFAS 157 effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We expect to adopt the remaining provisions of SFAS 157 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although we believe the adoption may impact the way that we determine the fair value of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination: recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any controlling interest; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R also changes the accounting for acquisition-related tax contingencies, requiring all such changes in these contingency liabilities to be recorded in earnings after the effective date. As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, we have significant liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Adjustments to the portion of these liabilities related to our acquisition of Pillsbury after the adoption of SFAS 141R could be material to net earnings. In December 2007, the FASB approved the issuance of SFAS 160. SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require: the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity, but separate from the parent equity; the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings; and changes in a parent ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently. SFAS 160 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. At that time we expect to reclassify the minority interests in our GMC subsidiary to stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also expect to reclassify retrospectively our distributions on those minority interests from interest expense to distributions to noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We have several other immaterial noncontrolling interests that will be reclassified in a similar manner. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. 43 Table of Contents Total Segment Operating Profit This non-GAAP measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Return on Average Total Capital This ratio is not defined by GAAP, and is used in internal management reporting and as a component of the Board of Directors rating of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is important for assessing the utilization of capital and it eliminates the effects of infrequently occurring events, thereby improving year-to-year comparability.
