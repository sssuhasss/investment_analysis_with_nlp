See ( Forward Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A. - Qualitative AND Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices On October 26, 2006, we received a letter from the Staff of the Pacific Regional Office of the SEC requesting that we voluntarily produce certain documents and information relating to the filing of SEC Forms 4 and our stock option granting practices from January 1, 1996 to the present. The SEC subsequently agreed, in the absence of any further requests, to limit the voluntary production of certain documents and information from January 1, 2001 to the present. We have cooperated with the SEC and believe that we have completed our production of the documents and information requested in the October 26, 2006 letter. In November 2006, we appointed a special committee of the Board of Directors (the Special Committee ) to undertake an independent investigation relating to our stock option grants and our stock option granting practices. The Special Committee retained independent counsel and accounting advisors to assist in conducting the investigation. The Special Committee reviewed all stock option grants from January 1, 2001 through November 13, 2006. In the course of its investigation, the Special Committee reviewed over one million documents and emails and extensively interviewed numerous officers and directors, as well as certain other personnel. The Special Committee has completed its independent investigation and found no willful or intentional misconduct in connection with the granting or dating of, or accounting for, stock options. The Special Committee also found that the late filing of certain Form 4 reports, as identified in a report issued 32 last year by Glass Lewis & Co., did not indicate that option grants had been backdated. The Special Committee found no evidence raising concerns with the integrity of management and found that management and other company personnel interviewed in the course of the investigation were cooperative and credible. Based on the Special Committee review of all stock option grants and our evaluation of applicable accounting rules, management concluded that the terms with respect to 10 new hire grants and two merit grants, had not been determined with finality as at the grant date, resulting in a decision to change the measurement dates for such grants. Additionally, seven grants were identified where the stock option agreements mistakenly reflected the exercise price at either the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to the grant date or the opening price of our common stock on the grant date instead of the closing price on the grant date, resulting in minor pricing errors. The pre-tax compensation expense resulting from the above-described accounting errors is approximately $0.1 million, which should have been recorded within operating expenses over the period from January 1, 2001 through the second quarter ended June 30, 2006. Additionally, we identified one grant where there was an error in the application of APB No. 25 related to a grant modification given to a non-executive employee in fiscal 2001 and a separate error in the application of SFAS No. 123(R), related to the cancellation of a grant to a non-executive employee in 2006. The pre-tax compensation adjustment for these two grants is approximately $1.0 million which should have been recorded within operating expenses over the period January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2006. As a result of the issues discussed above regarding our past stock option practices, certain of our option grants that were previously characterized as Incentive Stock Options in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 422 ( ISO ) will be considered to be non-qualified stock options. The unintentional accounting errors arising from the items discussed above caused non-cash compensation expense together with related employment tax expenses to be understated by a cumulative amount of $1.3 million ($1.0 million net of income tax) over the period January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2006. We have concluded that the impact of these errors is not material to our historical consolidated financial statements for any previously reported period. A correcting entry to record the cumulative impact of these errors was recorded during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The Company also does not consider the adjustment to be material to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The adjustments increased other operating expenses by $1.3 million and reduced provision for income taxes by $0.3 million, which resulted in a $1.0 million reduction in net income. The adjustment also had the effect of increasing non-current deferred tax assets by $0.05 million and reducing additional paid-in capital by $0.2 million at December 31, 2006. The Special Committee also found that during the time period covered by its review, internal accounting controls relating to our stock option granting process were inadequate, specifically control deficiencies related to the process of documenting the approval of stock option grants and the financial accounting in connection with certain option grants. In the summer of 2006, our internal audit department performed an analysis of certain aspects of our process for granting stock options. During that time, management implemented improvements relating to the documentation of stock option grants. These improvements included contemporaneous documentation of the approval of stock option grants and contemporaneous preparation of stock option agreements for the grants approved. Such practices were implemented during the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Additionally, beginning the second quarter of 2006, the accounting department implemented new procedures to review and verify the accuracy of grant prices. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company also implemented additional procedures for the communication and recording of modifications and cancellations of stock option grants. 33 Effective January 1, 2007, we implemented new written procedures regarding the granting of stock options. Under these new procedures, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ( Compensation Committee ) has sole and exclusive authority to grant stock option awards to all employees who are not new hires and to all new hires who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors ( Executive Committee ) each independently has the authority to grant awards to new hires who are not Section 16 employees. Awards granted by the Executive Committee are not subject to approval or ratification by the Board or the Compensation Committee. For purposes of these procedures, a new hire means: (i) an employee who is commencing employment with the Company or its subsidiaries; or (ii) an employee who is receiving a promotion to a new position with the Company or one of its subsidiaries. The grant date of any award to a new hire shall be the first day that The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq ) is open in the calendar month following the employee commencement of employment or the date of the employee promotion (as the case may be). Other than awards to new hires, awards may only be granted at a single meeting held during the last two weeks of May and November of each year. The grant date of any award granted at a May or November meeting shall be the first day that Nasdaq is open in June following such May meeting, or December following such November meeting (as the case may be). The new procedures also require certain same day documentation. The Special Committee found that the above described procedures constitute best practices. The Compensation Committee will review and approve stock option awards to our named executive officers ( NEOs ) based upon a review of competitive compensation data, its assessment of individual performance, a review of each executive long term incentives and retention considerations. Nasdaq Proceedings On November 15, 2006, we received a Nasdaq Staff Determination letter from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), and that our securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. We made a request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the Panel ). On January 4, 2007, we notified Nasdaq of our inadvertent issuance of an out-of-plan stock option to purchase 12,000 shares of our common stock (pre stock splits) to an outside director on November 5, 2004, approximately four months after the period for granting options under the Company Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the 1994 Plan ) had expired, in apparent violation of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1)(A). On January 10, 2007, we received another Nasdaq Staff Determination letter stating that because we had not yet regained compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(i)(1)(A), such violation served as an additional basis for delisting the Company securities from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Panel hearing was held on January 25, 2007. The Panel granted our request for continued listing of our securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Our continued listing is subject to certain conditions, including: (1) on or about March 26, 2007, we were required to submit to Nasdaq a copy of our final investigatory report or were required to respond to Nasdaq questions regarding the Special Committee investigation of option grants; (2) on or before May 1, 2007, we were required to inform the Panel that we had obtained stockholder approval for the granting of the out-of-plan option grant, or had unwound the option grant; and (3) on or before May 14, 2007, we were required to file our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. On March 5, 2007, we received an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination letter from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, we are not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting us from Nasdaq. On May 16, 2007, we received an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination letter from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, we are not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting us from Nasdaq. 34 We have met conditions (1), (2) and (3) of the Panel decision relating to our request for continued listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are still required to file our Form 10-Q for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 to achieve compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). By filing this Form 10-K, the Company has complied with the Panel deadline of June 14, 2007 for the filing of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The Company anticipates filing the Form 10-Q for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 as soon as practicable and within the time period required by Nasdaq to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result of the late filing of the 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and the 10-Q for the three-months ended March 31, 2007 we will be ineligible to register our securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others for one year. The inability to use Form S-3 could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period. However, we are still eligible to register our securities on Form S-1. If we fail to timely file a future periodic report with the SEC and our stock were delisted, it could severely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall future liquidity. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and functional drinks, non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, lemonades, juice cocktails, children multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice juices and non-carbonated lightly flavored energy waters under the Hansen brand name. We also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names; Monster Energy , Lost Energy , Joker Mad Energy , Unbound Energy and Ace brand names as well as Rumba brand energy juice. We also market, sell and distribute Java Monster non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. We also market, sell and distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue Sky brand name. Our fruit juices for toddlers are marketed under the Junior Juice brand name. We also market, sell and distribute vitamin and mineral drink mixes in powdered form under the Fizzit brand name. We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages and drink mixes is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we sample our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as cancer research and SPCAs, as well as extreme sports teams such as the Pro Circuit Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross 35 teams, Alan Pflueger Desert Racing Team, Kenny Bernstein Drag Racing Team, extreme sports figures and athletes, sporting events such as the Monster Energy Pro Pipeline surfing competition, Winter and Summer X-Games, marathons, 10k runs, bicycle races, volleyball tournaments and other health and sports related activities, including extreme sports, particularly supercross, freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile racing, etc., and we also participate in product demonstrations, food tasting and other related events. Posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. During 2006, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Monster Beverages Off-Premise Distribution Coordination Agreement and the Allied Products Distribution Coordination Agreement (jointly, the Off-Premise Agreements ) with Anheuser-Busch, Inc., a Missouri corporation ( AB ). Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the AB Distributors ) will distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC Monster Energy and Lost Energy TM brands non-alcoholic energy drinks, Rumba brand energy juice and Unbound Energy brand energy drinks, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. We intend to continue building our national distributor network primarily with select AB distributors as well as with our sales force throughout 2007 to support and grow the sales of our products. Pursuant to the Anheuser-Busch Distribution Agreements (the AB Distribution Agreements ) entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, non-refundable payments totaling $20.9 million were made to the Company by such newly appointed AB Distributors for the costs of terminating the Company prior distributors through December 31, 2006. Such receipts have been accounted for as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective AB Distribution Agreements. As of December 31, 2006, amounts totaling $3.3 million had been paid to the Company by certain other AB Distributors in anticipation of executing AB Distribution Agreements with the Company. Such receipts have been accounted for as customer deposit liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. Through December 31, 2006, the Company incurred termination costs amounting to $12.7 million in aggregate to certain of its prior distributors. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006. Certain amounts totaling $7.0 million included in such termination costs were not paid to our prior distributors before our fiscal year end and are therefore included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. On April 28, 2006, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with Cadbury Bebidas, S.A. de C.V. ( Cadbury Bebidas ), for exclusive distribution by Cadbury Bebidas throughout Mexico, excluding Baja California, of our Monster Energy and Lost Energy energy products. 36 On February 8, 2007, HBC entered into the On-Premise Distribution Coordination Agreement (the On-Premise Agreement ) with AB. Under the On-Premise Agreement, AB will manage and coordinate the sales, distribution and merchandising of Monster Energy energy drinks to on-premise retailers including bars, nightclubs and restaurants in territories approved by HBC. On March 1, 2007, HBC entered into a distribution agreement with Pepsi-QTG Canada, a division of PepsiCo Canada, ULC ( Pepsi Canada ), for the exclusive distribution by Pepsi Canada throughout Canada of our Monster Energy , Lost Energy , Hansen and Joker Mad Energy energy products. We again achieved record gross sales in 2006. The increase in gross sales in 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of certain of our existing products as well as certain new products, particularly Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks, Ace TM energy drinks and Unbound Energy drinks. The percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales, primarily due to a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 16.0% to 13.0%. The actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased to $90.5 million from $66.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. (See Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors ) During the year ended December 31, 2006, gross sales shipped outside of California represented 67.8% of our gross sales, as compared to 61.5% for the comparable period in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, gross sales to distributors outside the United States amounted to $19.3 million, as compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Such sales were approximately 2.8% of gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 and approximately 1.3% of gross sales for the comparable period in 2005. Our customers are typically retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2006 are reflected below. The allocations below reflect changes made by the Company to the categories historically reported. 2006 2005 2004 Retail Grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 12 % 19 % 25 % Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 14 % 11 % 13 % Full service distributors 69 % 65 % 52 % Health food distributors 2 % 3 % 6 % Other 3 % 2 % 4 % Our customers include Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group (formally known as Dr. Pepper Bottling/7UP Bottling Group), Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe s, John Lenore & Company, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Albertsons. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group, a customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 19%, 18% and 13% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 12% of the Company net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. 37 In September 2000, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Blue Sky, acquired the Blue Sky Natural Soda business. The Blue Sky natural soda brand is the leading natural soda in the health food trade. Blue Sky offers natural sodas, premium natural sodas with added ingredients such as Ginseng and anti-oxidant vitamins, organic sodas and seltzer waters in 12-ounce cans and a Blue Sky Blue Energy drink in 8.3-ounce cans and in 2004 introduced a new line of Blue Sky natural tea sodas in 12-ounce cans. In 2005, we introduced a new line of Blue Sky lite natural sodas, a new line of Blue Sky natural sodas made with real sugar and a new line of non-carbonated Blue Sky isotonic sports drinks. In 2006, we introduced our Blue Sky Blue Energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and introduced a new Blue Sky juice based energy drink in both 8-ounce and 16-ounce cans. In May 2001, HBC, through its wholly owned subsidiary Junior Juice, acquired the Junior Juice beverage business. The Junior Juice product line is comprised of a line of 100% juices packed in 4.23-ounce aseptic packages and is targeted at toddlers. In October 2006, we acquired the Unbound Energy trademark and assumed the production, marketing and sale of Unbound Energy energy drinks in 16-ounce cans. We subsequently introduced a lo-carb and juice version in 16-ounce cans. During 2004, we concluded exclusive contracts with the State of California, Department of Health Services Women, Infant and Children Supplemental Nutrition Branch, to supply 100% Apple juice and 100% blended juice in 64-ounce PET plastic bottles. The contracts commenced on July 12, 2004 and will expire in July 2008. (See Part I, Item 1. Business Manufacture and Distribution ). We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: Profitable Growth We believe natural, better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding and growing our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. We believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. One key area of focus, for example, is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction in inventory levels. However, due to the expansion in the number of our products, increased sales levels in 2006, and the conclusion of the agreements with AB, overall inventory levels increased. During 2006, the costs of PET plastic bottles and aluminum cans, as well as the costs of high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, certain juice concentrates, including apple, and certain packaging and freight costs also increased. Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our costs of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and overall low costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. 38 We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in (1) maintaining and/or improving our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. In 2006, gross sales totaled $696.3 million, a 67.6% increase over 2005. Net sales totaled $605.8 million in 2006, an increase of 73.6% over 2005. Gross profit totaled $316.6 million in 2006, a 73.4% increase from 2005. Operating income was $158.6 million compared to $103.4 million for 2005. Net income was $97.9 million as compared to $62.8 million for 2005. Net income per diluted share was $0.99 as compared to net income per diluted share of $0.65 in 2005. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2007 and beyond. See also Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005. In 2006, the Company had working capital of $212.3 million compared to $107.3 million as of December 31, 2005. In 2006, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $76.4 million as compared to $54.6 million in 2005. Principal uses of cash flows are purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and trademarks. Payment of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (See also Part II, Item 7. - Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Increase in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our company future financial results include, but are not limited to: maintenance of our brand images and product quality; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See also Part I, Item 1. - - Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing ); restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; 39 protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit of new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener that is used in many of our beverage products, due to demand for such sweetener exceeding the supplier production capacity, as well as limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can and copacking availability; the imposition of additional restrictions; and (See also Part I, Item 1A. - Risk Factors ) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential for non-alcoholic beverage categories including energy drinks, carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water; new product introductions intended to contribute to higher gross profits; premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; proper positioning to capture industry growth; and broadening distribution/expansion opportunities 40 Results of Operations Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns * $ 696,322 $ 415,417 $ 224,098 67.6 % 85.4 % Less: Promotional and other allowances** 90,548 66,531 43,757 36.1 % 52.0 % Net sales 605,774 348,886 180,341 73.6 % 93.5 % Cost of sales 289,180 166,343 96,875 73.8 % 71.7 % Gross profit 316,594 182,543 83,466 73.4 % 118.7 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 52.3 % 52.3 % 46.3 % Operating expenses 158,015 79,100 49,580 99.8 % 59.5 % Operating income 158,579 103,443 33,886 53.3 % 205.3 % Operating income as a percent of net sales 26.2 % 29.6 % 18.8 % Interest income, net 3,660 1,351 52 170.9 % 2,498.1 % Income before provision for income taxes 162,239 104,794 33,938 54.8 % 208.8 % Provision for income taxes 64,290 42,019 13,551 53.0 % 210.1 % Net income $ 97,949 $ 62,775 $ 20,387 56.0 % 207.9 % Net income as a percent of net sales 16.2 % 18.0 % 11.3 % Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.09 $ 0.71 $ 0.24 53.0 % 196.9 % Diluted $ 0.99 $ 0.65 $ 0.22 52.9 % 201.2 % Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 72,740 48,214 29,760 50.9 % 62.0 % * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. 41 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Segment Reclassification. Rumba TM brand energy juice, which was previously reported in the Warehouse segment, is now reported in the DSD segment. Similarly, Hansen energy drinks, which were previously reported in the DSD segment, are now reported in the Warehouse segment. For presentation purposes, these changes are assumed to have commenced January 1, 2006 and are reflected as such in the figures for the year ended December 31, 2006. The comparable figures for such products for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously reported, have been recast to reflect the above reclassification. Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $280.9 million or 67.6% higher than the $415.4 million gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in gross sales for 2006 was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes of certain of our existing products, including the full year sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks which were introduced in August 2005. Promotional and other allowances were $90.5 million for 2006 an increase of 24.0 million or 36.1% higher than promotional and other allowances of $66.5 million for 2005. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased from 16.0% in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006. As a result the percentage increase in gross sales in 2006 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales . Net sales were $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $256.9 million or 73.6% higher than net sales of $348.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy drinks (introduced in 2003), Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks (introduced in September 2004), as well as sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005). To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Lost Energy drinks (introduced in January 2004), sports drinks, Rumba brand energy juice (introduced December 2004), Junior Juice , Ace energy drinks (introduced in August 2006) and Unbound Energy energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen energy drinks, smoothies in cans and Energade energy sports drinks. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents were 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 24.5 million cases or 50.9% higher than case sales of 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $8.33 for 2006 or 15% higher than the net sales price per case of $7.24 for 2005. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $514.3 million for year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $251.4 million or 95.6% higher than net sales of $262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks, as well as sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks, Rumba TM brand energy juice, Ace TM energy drinks and Unbound Energy energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Energade energy sports drinks. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $5.5 million or 6.4% higher than net sales of $86.0 million for the year 42 ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of teas, lemonades and juice cocktails, Junior Juice and sports drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross Profit.*** Gross profit was $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $134.1 million or 73.4% higher than the gross profit of $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for both 2006 and 2005. Increases in sales volumes contributed to an increase in gross profit dollars. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was affected by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. In addition, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also affected by a significant increase in certain freight-in costs due to the addition of new co-packers and warehouses and an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including sucrose, PET and aluminum cans and apple juice concentrate. These factors were offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 99.8% higher than total operating expenses of $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.1% for 2006 from 22.6% for 2005. The increase in total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased selling and distribution, and general and administrative expenses. Selling and distribution expenses were $95.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $44.5 million or 87.8% higher than selling and distribution expenses of $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 15.7%, which was higher than selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales of 14.6% for 2005. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $18.9 million primarily due to increased volumes of shipments and increased freight rates and fuel prices, as well as increased expenditures of $6.9 million for merchandise displays primarily in anticipation of the changeover to select AB distributors, $4.3 million for sponsorships and endorsements, $4.3 million for trade development activities with distributors and customers, $2.7 million for commissions and royalties , and $1.8 million for sampling programs. General and administrative expenses were $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $34.4 million or 121.6% higher than general and administrative expenses of $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2006 were 10.4%, which was higher than general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of 8.1% for 2005. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors of $12.7 million, stock compensation expense of $8.3 million as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123R which was not expensed in the previous year (see Part II, Item 8, Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation ) including a cumulative adjustment of $1.3 million relating to stock based compensation and related charges (see Part II, Item 8, Note 13, Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices ), an increase in payroll expenses of $5.3 million, and an increase of $5.2 million in professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $3.8 million relating to the Company special investigation of stock option grants. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the 43 DSD segment was $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $78.9 million or 72.4% higher than contribution margin of $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $6.1 million for 2006, a decrease of approximately $4.3 million or 41.0% lower than contribution margin of $10.4 million for 2005. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to reduced sales of Hansen energy drinks and a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately $55.2 million or 53.4% higher than operating income of $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in operating income was attributable to higher gross profit, which was offset by increased selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.2% for 2006 from 29.6% for 2005. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Interest Income, net . Net interest income was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $2.3 million from net interest income of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on the Company invested cash balances which have increased significantly over the year. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $64.3 million as compared to provision for income taxes of $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for was 39.6%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 40.1% for 2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that are exempt from federal income taxes and, certain federal tax credits relating to export sales, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in state taxes due to the apportionment of sales to various states outside of California which have lower state tax rates. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options for which we received no tax benefit. Net Income . Net income was $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $35.1 million or 56.0% higher than net income of $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net income was attributable to the increase in gross profit of approximately $134.1 million and the increase in net interest income of approximately $2.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of approximately $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of approximately $22.3 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Segment Reclassification . Rumba TM brand energy juice, which was previously reported in the Warehouse segment, is now reported in the DSD segment. Similarly, Hansen energy drinks, which were previously reported in the DSD segment, are now reported in the Warehouse segment. For presentation purposes, these changes are assumed to have commenced January 1, 2006 and are reflected as such in the figures for the year ended December 31, 2006. The comparable figures for such products for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as previously reported, have been restated to reflect the above reclassification. Gross Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gross sales were $415.4 million, an increase of $191.3 million or 85.4% higher than gross sales of $224.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products and the introduction of new products as discussed below in Net Sales. The percentage increase in gross sales was lower than the percentage increase in net sales due to a decrease in 44 the promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales, which decreased from 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005, although the actual amount of promotional and other allowances increased from $43.8 million to $66.5 million for the respective periods. *Gross sales see definition above Net Sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net sales were $ 348.9 million, an increase of $168.5 million or 93.5% higher than net sales of $180.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We again achieved record sales in 2005. The increase in gross and net sales in 2005 was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy drinks, which were introduced in April 2002, including our lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, which were introduced in 2003, our Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks, which were introduced in September 2004, sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks, which were introduced in August 2005, increased sales by volume of Lost Energy TM energy drinks which were introduced in January 2004, and to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad Energy TM drinks which were introduced in January 2005, as well as increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, and children multi-vitamin juice drinks and Rumba which was introduced in December 2004. The increase in gross and net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of Hansen Natural Sodas , Hansen energy drinks, Energade and Smoothies in cans. Net sales case volumes (calculated on 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage equivalent basis) increased from 29.8 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2004 to 48.2 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 18.4 million cases or 62.0%. The overall average net sales price per case also increased to $7.24 per case for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $6.06 for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 19.5%. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was due to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as described below. Net sales for the DSD segment were $262.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $163.5 million or 164.4% higher than net sales of $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy drinks, including our lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, our Monster Energy Assault TM energy drinks, sales of Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks, increased sales by volume of Lost Energy TM energy drinks. The increase in net sales was also attributable, to a lesser extent, to sales of Joker Mad Energy TM drinks and Rumba TM energy juice. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of Energade . Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $86.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $5.1 million or 6.3% higher than net sales of $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of Hansen apple juice and juice blends, children multi-vitamin juice drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by lower sales by volume of smoothies in cans, Hansen energy drinks and Hansen Natural Sodas . Gross Profit . Gross profit was $182.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $99.1 million or 118.7% over the $83.5 million gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which was higher than gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 46.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to higher gross profit margins achieved on the increased sales of Monster Energy and Lost Energy TM energy drinks. Although a greater percentage of our sales comprised products having higher gross margins than the prior year, the increase in profit margins was partially reduced by higher promotional payments and allowances to promote our products. *** Gross Profit see definition above 45 Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses were $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $29.5 million or 59.6% over total operating expenses of $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005, from 27.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the comparatively lower increase in selling, general and administrative expenses than the increase in net sales. Distribution expenses, which include out-bound freight and warehousing expenses after manufacture, were $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and have been included in operating expenses. Selling . Selling expenses were $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $21.5 million or 73.7% over selling expenses of $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 16.2% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution (freight) and storage expenses which increased by $9.7 million, increased expenditures for trade development activities and cooperative arrangements with our customers and distributors, which increased by $4.2 million, increased expenditures for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials, and premiums, which increased by $3.0 million, increased expenditures for sponsorships and endorsements which increased $1.7 million, increased expenditures for advertising which increased by $1.3 million, and increased expenditures for samples, which increased by $1.2 million. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $8.0 million or 39.4% over general and administrative expenses of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 11.3% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to payroll expenses which increased by $3.6 million, distributor termination payments which increased by $1.2 million and travel and entertainment expenses which increased by $0.7 million. Amortization of Trademarks . Amortization of trademarks was $0.07 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $0.003 million from amortization of trademarks of $0.073 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in amortization of trademarks was due to a reduction in the balance of definite life trademarks. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin represents net sales by segment less the cost of sales and operating expenses which can be directly attributed to segment net sales. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $73.9 million or 210.5% higher than contribution margin of $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks and Lost Energy TM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $0.8 million or 8.3% higher than contribution margin of $9.6 million for year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to increased sales of apple juice and juice blends which was offset by the reduced contribution from lower sales of Hansen energy drinks. Operating Income. Operating income was $103.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $69.6 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profits, which was partially offset by increased operating expenses. 46 Interest Income, net . Net interest income was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to net interest income of $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net interest income consists of interest income and interest and financing expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the cash balances in interest bearing accounts during the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.4 million compared to interest income of $0.09 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest and financing expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.08 million compared to $0.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in interest and financing expense was primarily attributable to an increase in capital leases entered into during 2005. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $42.0 million which was an increase of $28.4 million as compared to the provision for income taxes of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2005 was 40.1%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 39.9% for 2004. Net Income. Net income was $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, which was an increase of $42.4 million as compared to net income of $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $99.1 million increase in gross profit and an increase of net interest income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 which was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $29.5 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $28.4 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $54.6 million in the comparable period in 2005. For 2006, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $97.9 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $8.3 million of share-based compensation and $1.5 million of depreciation and other amortization. In 2006, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $20.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $14.0 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $7.7 million increase in accounts payable, a $21.1 million increase in income taxes payable, a $1.0 million increase in accrued compensation and a $3.3 million increase in customer deposit liabilities. In 2006, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $45.6 million increase in inventories, a $25.9 million increase in accounts receivable, a $17.3 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options and a $10.9 million increase in deferred income taxes. The increase in accounts receivable was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as to increased sales to certain classes of customers who have longer payment terms. The increase in inventory is attributable to the addition of new copackers and warehouses, the introduction of new products and planned inventory levels to meet consumer demand. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $95.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $3.2 million provided by investing activities in the comparable period in 2005. For 2006, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short-term investments, particularly available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments. Cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support the marketing and promotional activities of the Company, production equipment, computer and office furniture and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as wells as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that it will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess 47 of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short-term investments and for other corporate purposes. Management, from time to time, considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of the Company brands. Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $0.1 million for the comparable period in 2005. For 2006, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of $27.7 million of the Company common stock and principal payments of long-term debt of $1.2 million in relation to lease payments made on vehicle leases entered into over the past year. In 2006, cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a $17.3 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and by proceeds of $3.9 million received from the issuance of common stock. Debt and other obligations HBC has a credit facility from Comerica Bank ( Comerica ) consisting of a revolving line of credit which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, HBC increased its available borrowing under the revolving line of credit from $7.5 million collateralized to $10.0 million non-collateralized. The revolving line of credit remains in full force and effect through June 1, 2008. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying LIBOR rates up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by HBC. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2006. The terms of the Company line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2006. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations under our agreement with the Las Vegas Monorail Company and other commitments. (See also Part II, Item 8 - Note 10, Commitments & Contingencies ). Purchase commitments include obligations made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. The following represents a summary of the Company contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2006: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 26,459 $ 13,197 $ 13,142 $ 120 $ Capital Leases 303 299 4 Operating Leases 26,198 3,079 6,033 4,966 12,120 Purchase Commitments 25,385 21,554 3,831 $ 78,345 $ 38,129 $ 23,010 $ 5,086 $ 12,120 48 In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company ( Rexam ), dated as of January 1, 2006, the Company has undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should the Company fail to purchase the minimum volume, the Company will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital reimbursements on a pro-rated basis. The Company maximum liability under this agreement is $8.6 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. Management believes that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, debt servicing, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on the Company current plans, at this time the Company estimates that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $10.0 million through December 2007. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. In October 2006, the Company entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the Company leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space will replace the Company existing warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. We plan to sublet our existing office, warehouse and distribution space for the remainder of the lease term, unless we are able to find a tenant acceptable to the landlord and the landlord agrees to the early termination of the lease. In October 2006, the Company also entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, located adjacent to the new leased warehouse and distribution facility located in Corona, California for the purpose of constructing a new office building thereon which will replace the Company existing office space in Corona, California. In the interim, the Company has leased additional office space located near our existing corporate offices. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarizes the most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices of the Company: Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where the Company becomes aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the Company believes will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the Company recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. 49 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. The Company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the Company estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or its ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for the Company products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for the Company products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2006. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent the Company exclusive ownership of the Hansen trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. The Company also owns in its own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. The Company also owns the Blue Sky trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2006, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. 50 In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company historical experience. Amounts paid to the Company by newly appointed AB Distributors for the costs of terminating certain of the Company prior distributors are accounted for as deferred revenue which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated 20 year life of the respective AB Distribution Agreements. Net Sales Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue ( EITF ) No. 01-09. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of our products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport our products to our customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of the Company prior distributors, depreciation, and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The Company employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with the Company assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to its results of operations. 51 Income Taxes Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company considers future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, the Company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the Company judgment. If the Company subsequently determines that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding newly issued accounting pronouncements is contained in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. Unit case volume of the Company means number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the Company. Sales of food bars and cereals, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. The Company quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for Hansen products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of Hansen products expands outside of California. The Company experience with its energy drink products, suggests that they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of the Company sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.
