OVERVIEW With the convergence of IT and business, technology has become increasingly more important not just to technology professionals, but also to business executives. We are an independent and objective research and advisory firm that helps IT and business executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market-leading position and brand franchise. Our strategy is to align our resources and our infrastructure to leverage that intellectual capital into additional revenue streams through effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services. Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting and events. A key strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis. We intend to maintain a balance between (1) pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our three core businesses and (2) generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure. We have three business segments: research, consulting and events. Research provides research content and advice for IT professionals, technology companies and the investment community in the form of reports and briefings, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for CIOs and other senior executives. Consulting consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day analyst engagements) ( SAS ), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT industry. Events consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry. We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: Business Segment BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. 8 Table of Contents Business Segment BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing Rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the total number of people who attended events during the period. ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF META GROUP, INC. On December 27, 2004, we announced an agreement to acquire META Group, Inc. ( META ) in an all-cash transaction for $10.00 per share, or approximately $162 million, excluding transaction costs. META is a publicly owned, premier information technology and research firm based in Stamford, Connecticut with 715 employees. In 2004, META generated $141.5 million in revenue from 52 worldwide locations and had $90.8 million of assets at December 31, 2004. META trades on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol METG. The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the transaction, and on January 31, 2005, we announced that notice had been received from the Federal Trade Commission of early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. META filed its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on February 17, 2005 and is scheduled to hold a special meeting of stockholders to approve the transaction on March 23, 2005. Closing of the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by META stockholders, is expected to be effective April 1, 2005. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION During Calendar 2004, we have continued to focus on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core Research business. This continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of Calendar 2003. We ended the latter half of Calendar 2003 with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value. Contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of Calendar 2004, decreased slightly during the second quarter of Calendar 2004, and increased sequentially again in both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, contract value was $509.2 million, up 6% from the $482.2 million at December 31, 2003, with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency. The $509.2 million contract value represents our highest contract value since the first quarter of Calendar 2002. Our Research client retention rate at December 31, 2004 increased to 80% from 78% at the prior year-end, while wallet retention increased to 95% from 89% over the same period. Consulting revenue for Calendar 2004 was flat when compared to Calendar 2003, despite the impact of the realignment in which we reduced headcount when we exited certain practices and geographies. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenues would have decreased approximately 4% in Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Our Consulting business ended Calendar 2004 with the continuation of the positive trend that began in Calendar 2003, when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases. Due to the realignment, consulting backlog decreased to $91.7 million at March 31, 2004, but quickly increased to $97.7 million at June 30, 2004 and $103.4 million at September 30, 2004, as business ramped up in our areas of focus. We ended the year with a backlog of $111.8 million, a $12.1 million increase over December 31, 2003. The realignment has also had a positive impact on sub-optimal utilization rates and our lack of scale in some regions. During Calendar 2004, our average consultant utilization rates increased to approximately 63% as compared to 54% in the prior year, while billable headcount declined to 493 at December 31, 2004, compared to 526 at December 31, 2003. Our Events business continues to deliver strong results. Our emphasis on managing the Events portfolio to retain our long-time successful events and introduce promising new events has resulted in substantially improved overall revenue performance, with Calendar 2004 revenue up 16% over the prior year, as well as same event revenue, up 19% over the prior year. We achieved these results while the number of events declined, with 56 held during Calendar 2004 as compared to 57 held in Calendar 2003. 9 Table of Contents During Calendar 2004, we repurchased a significant number of shares of our Class A and Class B Common Stock. During the first half of Calendar 2004, we repurchased 413,225 shares of our Class A Common Stock and 114,600 shares of our Class B Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $6.1 million under our Stock Repurchase Program. During the third quarter of 2004, we completed a Dutch Auction Tender Offer in which we repurchased 11,339,019 shares of our Class A Common Stock and 5,505,489 shares of our Class B Common Stock at a purchase price of $13.30 and $12.50 per share, respectively. Additionally, we also repurchased 9,228,938 shares of our Class A Common Stock from Silver Lake Partners and certain of its affiliates ( Silver Lake ) at a purchase price of $13.30 per share. The total cost of these purchases was $346.2 million, including transaction costs of $3.8 million. In conjunction with the tender offer, our Board of Directors terminated the Stock Repurchase Program in June 2004. In connection with the tender offer, in the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we borrowed $200.0 million under a five-year term loan facility, of which $10.0 million was repaid in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. We also obtained a $100.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility, of which $59.2 million was available at December 31, 2004. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement covenant requirements which resulted in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. As a result, the amended borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility would have been $96.5 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had a cash balance of $160.1 million compared to $230.0 million at December 31, 2003. In order to fund the purchase of META, we anticipate that we will use a combination of cash and our amended five-year revolving credit facility. In connection with funding the META transaction, the Company anticipates repatriating $52.0 million in cash earnings from its non-US subsidiaries in early 2005. In February 2005, our Board of Directors approved the elimination of our classified Board structure. Additionally, as previously announced, the Board of Directors has approved the combination of our Class A and Class B Common Stock. Both of these items are subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders to take place in the late spring or early summer of 2005. During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we made a significant change to our capital structure. Our 6% convertible notes were converted into Class A Common Stock. This eliminated all of our outstanding debt at that time and the related interest expense. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of Symposia, our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; and competition in the industry. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term; Consulting revenues are based primarily on fixed fees or time and materials for discrete projects. Revenues for such projects are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided and are evaluated on a contract by contract basis; Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition; and Other revenues, principally software licensing fees, are recognized when a signed non-cancelable software license exists, delivery has occurred, collection is probable, and the fees are fixed or determinable. Revenue from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement, which is typically twelve months. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that have a 30-day cancellation clause, but have not produced material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. For those government contracts that permit termination, we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were $40.9 million and $38.6 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues, relating to government contracts that permit termination, of $4.2 and $6.6 million, respectively. 10 Table of Contents Uncollectible fees receivable Provisions for bad debts are recognized as incurred. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable, along with the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2004 2003 Total fees receivable $ 266,139 $ 275,122 Allowance for losses (8,450 ) (9,000 ) Fees receivable, net $ 257,689 $ 266,122 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS 142 ). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge, for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit, to earnings in our financial statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. During 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in South America that were closed, and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 million related to the exit from certain non-core product lines. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made. Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals We record accruals for severance costs, lease costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we revised our previous estimates for costs and losses associated with excess facilities due to declines in market rates for expected sublease income and revised expected periods of sublease. As a result of these revised estimates, we recorded a charge for excess facilities of $2.3 million, which was included in Other charges along with severance, impairment, and other costs. Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end. 11 Table of Contents Impairment of investment securities A charge to earnings is made when a market decline below cost is other than temporary. Management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include: the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, the valuation of comparable companies and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. We own equity securities through two limited partnerships, SI Venture Associates ( SI I ) and SI Venture Fund II ( SI II ), which are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid-stage IT-based or Internet-enabled companies. At December 31, 2004, we owned 100% of SI I and 22% of SI II. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we made the decision to liquidate SI I and to sell our interest in SI II. In addition, in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $1.5 million related to the liquidation of SI I, which included $0.8 million for the write-down of the investment and $0.7 million in related shutdown charges. No charges were recorded on SI II in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the planned sale since the carrying value of the investment approximates its net realizable value. In the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.2 million related to the transfer of our investment in TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points. As a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership, we were relieved of all future capital calls, which had totaled $4.0 million. Total investments in equity securities were $7.0 million at December 31, 2004 and $10.9 million at December 31, 2003 (see Note 5 Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR On October 30, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a change of our fiscal year-end from September 30 to December 31, effective January 1, 2003. This change resulted in a three-month transitional period ending December 31, 2002. References to Transition 2002, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the three-month transitional period ended December 31, 2002. References to Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, unless otherwise indicated, are to the respective fiscal year period from October 1 through September 30. References to Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003, and Calendar 2002, unless otherwise indicated, are to the respective twelve-month period from January 1 through December 31. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CALENDAR 2004 VERSUS CALENDAR 2003 Total revenues increased 4% to $893.8 million during Calendar 2004 from $858.4 million during Calendar 2003. Research revenues increased 3% in Calendar 2004 to $480.5 million, compared to $466.9 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 54% of total revenues in both Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003. Consulting revenues in Calendar 2004 of $259.4 were up slightly compared to the $258.6 in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 29% and 30% of total revenues in Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, respectively. Events revenues were $138.4 million in Calendar 2004, an increase of 16% from the $119.4 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 15% of total revenues in Calendar 2004 versus 14% in Calendar 2003. Other revenues, consisting principally of software licensing and maintenance fees, increased 15% to $15.5 million in Calendar 2004 from $13.6 million in Calendar 2003. The effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 3% positive effect on total revenues for Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Excluding the positive effects of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 1%. See the Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues. Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 4% to $559.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $535.7 million in Calendar 2003. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased 4% to $263.0 million in Calendar 2004 from $252.3 million in Calendar 2003. Revenues from sales to clients in other international regions increased 1% to $71.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $70.5 million in Calendar 2003. Cost of services and product development increased 6% during Calendar 2004 to $434.5 million from $410.7 million during Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, cost of services and product development would have increased by 2%, primarily due to increased investment in our core Research business. Growth in our Executive Programs and Events businesses also contributed to higher costs in Calendar 2004. As a percentage of sales, cost of services and product development increased to 48.6% from 47.8% in the prior year period. Cost of services and product development in Calendar 2004 benefited from the reversal of $3.5 million of prior years incentive compensation. 12 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%, to $349.8 million during Calendar 2004 from $333.4 million during Calendar 2003. SG&A would have increased by approximately 2% excluding the negative effects of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense increased slightly in Calendar 2004, to 39.1% of sales from 38.8% in Calendar 2003. SG&A expenses benefited during Calendar 2004 from the reversal of $3.3 million of prior years incentive compensation, as well as a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.7 million due to increased collections and a decline in bad debt write-offs as a percentage of sales. Depreciation expense for Calendar 2004 decreased 23% to $27.7 million, compared to $36.0 million for Calendar 2003. The decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002 relative to the capital spending during Fiscal 2001 and 2000, which led to a decrease in depreciation expense. Amortization of intangibles decreased 46% when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003 due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized since the third quarter of Calendar 2003. Goodwill impairments were $2.7 million in Calendar 2004 compared to $0 in Calendar 2003, reflecting the write-off of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in Latin America and other non-core product lines. Other charges during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 were $11.9 million, of which $5.9 million was for severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction of 40 employees. We expect additional workforce reductions to occur during the first quarter of Calendar 2005 which will result in an additional severance and benefits charge estimated at between $5.0 million and $6.0 million. Other charges of $4.3 million during the third quarter of Calendar 2004 primarily included severance costs associated with the departure of our President and our former CEO of $3.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Other charges of $9.1 million during the second quarter of Calendar 2004 included $3.8 million of severance costs associated with the departure of our former CEO, as well as $5.3 million of costs associated with the termination of 30 employees. During the first quarter of Calendar 2004, other charges of $10.5 million were primarily associated with a realignment of our workforce. This workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan initiated during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 and resulted in the termination of 132 employees, or approximately 4% of our workforce, bringing the total terminations associated with the action plan to 262 employees. We expect payments associated with the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of Calendar 2005. We are funding these costs out of existing cash. For all of Calendar 2004, we recorded total charges of $29.7 million related to the realignment of our workforce, including costs of $7.7 million related to the departure of our President and our former CEO. The realignment resulted in the termination of 203 employees for the full year. The annualized savings from the termination of these employees would be approximately $23.3 million. However, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving our products, processes, and infrastructure to help drive future growth. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. We also recorded a charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the abandonment of certain internal systems, and $1.8 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other non-core operations. As part of our continuing effort to adjust our office space as needs change, we have announced plans to reduce our office space in San Jose, California by consolidating employees from two buildings into one building in the second or third quarter of Calendar 2005, which we estimate will result in a charge ranging from $6.0 to $7.0 million. In the first quarter of Calendar 2005, we plan to restructure certain international operations, which we estimate will result in a charge ranging from $4.0 million to $5.0 million. Other charges of $29.7 million during Calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions, $5.4 million during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 and $14.6 million during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $9.7 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in Transition 2002, which resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2% of our workforce. The purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments. The workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 resulted in the termination of 130 employees, or approximately 3% of our workforce. The purpose of this workforce reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations, strengthen key consulting practices, and align our organizational structure to focus on client needs. Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2004 was a loss of $3.0 million. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $0.8 million related to the liquidation of SI I. In addition, we recorded an additional charge of $0.7 million in related liquidation costs, which is recorded in Other charges. In the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $2.2 million for the transfer of our investment in TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points. As a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership, we were relieved of all future capital calls, which had totaled $4.0 million. See Note 5 Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 13 Table of Contents Gain (loss) on investments, net of $4.7 million during Calendar 2003 includes a $5.5 million insurance recovery received during Calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business. Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2003 also includes an impairment loss of $0.9 million associated with a minority-owned investment not publicly traded. We evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity, which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value. The conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of 2003 decreased our interest expense. However, due to the new credit agreement signed in the third quarter of 2004, interest expense will increase in the future. Other (expense), net for Calendar 2004 of $3.9 million includes the non-cash write-off of $3.1 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in South America that we have closed. As a result of this decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation. Other income, net for Calendar 2003 of $0.5 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains. Provision for income taxes was 51.0% and 33.4% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for Calendar 2004, as compared to that of Calendar 2003, reflects the impact of a charge for planned repatriation of foreign earnings in Calendar 2005 at a one-time favorable tax rate pursuant to the Jobs Creation Act of 2004. It also reflects the impact of certain non-deductible book charges for workforce reductions, excess facilities, asset impairments, and losses on capital investments. These additional charges are partially offset by the release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credits. Excluding these other charges, the effective tax rate would have been 32.7% in Calendar 2004, as compared to 33% in Calendar 2003. SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, and other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research Research revenues increased 3% when comparing Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, but excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue was flat. Research gross contribution of $292.7 million for Calendar 2004 decreased slightly from the $292.9 million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 decreased to 61% from 63% in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin in Calendar 2004 was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs, which have lower margins than our core subscription products, as well as continued investment in our people, products, and processes required to provide Research growth. Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $509.2 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of 6% from $482.2 million at December 31, 2003, with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency. The research contract value of $509.2 million at December 31, 2004 represents our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of Calendar 2002. During this period, we have been focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core Research business. This continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half of Calendar 2003. We ended the latter half of 2003 with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract value. Contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of Calendar 2004, decreased slightly during the second quarter of Calendar 2004, and increased sequentially again in both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, our client retention rates increased 2 percentage points to 80% as compared to the same measure at December 31, 2003. Wallet retention increased 6 percentage points during Calendar 2004 to 95%. While wallet retention rates held steady or climbed over the four quarters of Calendar 2004, client retention dipped slightly in the first quarter and then climbed for the remainder of the year. Our Executive Program membership was 2,708 at December 31, 2004, up 16% from 2,332 at December 31, 2003, which is attributed to new business growth in North America and EMEA, as well as improved renewal rates. Consulting Consulting revenues of $259.4 for Calendar 2004 were up slightly when compared to the $258.6 million in Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenues would have decreased approximately 4% in Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Adjusted for currency effects, Consulting revenue decreased compared to the prior year as a result of our realignment of our business to exit certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies. 14 Table of Contents Consulting gross contribution of $92.7 million for Calendar 2004 increased 7% from the $86.8 million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 increased to 36% from 34% in the prior year. The increase in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to higher consultant utilization rates, which were approximately 63% during Calendar 2004 as compared to approximately 54% during Calendar 2003, as the effects of the realignment were realized, and the reduction in our billable headcount to 493 at December 31, 2004 as compared to 526 at December 31, 2003, a 6% decrease. Our billable rate was $327.00 per hour in Calendar 2004, a 7% increase from the $306.00 rate in Calendar 2003, which is due to more efficient use of staff globally and a higher billable rate in EMEA due to the effects of foreign exchange. Consulting backlog increased 12% to $111.8 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $99.7 million at December 31, 2003. Our Consulting business ended Calendar 2004 with the continuation of the positive trend that began in Calendar 2003, when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases. Due to the realignment in which we exited certain practices and geographies, consulting backlog decreased to $91.7 million at March 31, 2004, but increased to $97.7 million at June 30, 2004 and $103.4 million at September 30, 2004, as business ramped up in our areas of focus. Events Events revenues increased 16% to $138.4 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $119.4 million for Calendar 2003. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 2% favorable impact on revenues when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003. Revenues have increased despite having one less event during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003, with 56 and 57 events, respectively. Revenue for Calendar 2004 increased due to higher attendance and higher average exhibitor revenue, resulting in higher average revenue per event in our recurring events. Attendance at Events increased to 30,999 in Calendar 2004 from 27,547 in Calendar 2003, a 12.5% increase, which is attributed to the popularity of the topics offerred. Gross contribution of $69.5 million for Calendar 2004 was 24% higher than the $56.0 million recorded in Calendar 2003. As a percentage of revenues, gross contribution increased to 50% during Calendar 2004 from 47% during Calendar 2003. The increase in gross contribution margin was due to the mix of events as well as lower personnel and marketing costs. Also, during 2003, we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy, especially in the technology sector. CALENDAR 2003 VERSUS CALENDAR 2002 Total revenues decreased 3% to $858.4 million during Calendar 2003 from $887.6 million during Calendar 2002. Research revenues decreased 4% in Calendar 2003 to $466.9 million, compared to $487.0 million in Calendar 2002, and comprised approximately 54% and 55% of total revenues in Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002, respectively. Consulting revenues decreased 6% to $258.6 million in Calendar 2003, compared to $276.1 million in Calendar 2002, and comprised approximately 30% and 31% of total revenues in Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002, respectively. Events revenues were $119.4 million in Calendar 2003, an increase of 9% from the $109.7 million in Calendar 2002, and comprised approximately 14% of total revenues in Calendar 2003 versus 12% in Calendar 2002. Other revenues, consisting principally of software licensing and maintenance fees, decreased 9% to $13.6 million in Calendar 2003 from $14.9 million in Calendar 2002. While revenues declined in the United States and Canada region, they increased in our EMEA and the Other International regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients decreased 7% to $535.7 million in Calendar 2003 from $576.5 million in Calendar 2002. Revenues from sales to clients in the EMEA region increased 5% to $252.3 million in Calendar 2003 from $241.3 million in Calendar 2002. Revenues from sales to clients in Other International regions increased 1% to $70.5 million in Calendar 2003 from $69.8 million in Calendar 2002. The decrease in our total revenues was a result of a decline in demand throughout the entire technology sector and the overall weakness in the economy, partially offset by the positive effects of foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, revenues would have decreased approximately 8%. See Segment Analysis section below for a further discussion of segment revenues. Cost of services and product development increased 4% during Calendar 2003 to $410.7 million from $396.5 million during Calendar 2002. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, cost of services and product development would have decreased by 1%. As a percentage of sales, cost of services and product development increased to 47.8% from 44.7% due primarily to investments in Gartner EXP, membership programs, product development and costs associated with customer intelligence, higher conference related expenses and lower utilization rates for our consulting practice. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4%, to $333.4 million during Calendar 2003 from $346.5 million during Calendar 2002. SG&A would have decreased by approximately 7% had it not been for the negative effect of foreign currency translation. The 15 Table of Contents decrease in SG&A was primarily the result of lower sales commissions and our continued focus on streamlining our support organizations and restructuring efforts. Depreciation expense for Calendar 2003 decreased 18% to $36.0 million, compared to $43.7 million for Calendar 2002. The decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during Calendar 2002 and Calendar 2003 relative to the capital spending during Fiscal 2000 and 2001, which led to a decrease in depreciation expense. In addition, costs capitalized during Fiscal 2000 associated with the initial launch of the gartner.com Web site in January 2001 have been fully depreciated as of the beginning of Calendar 2003. Amortization of intangibles decreased 34% when comparing Calendar 2003 to Calendar 2002 due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized over the past year. Other charges of $29.7 million during Calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions, $5.4 million during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 and $14.6 million during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we revised our estimates of previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $9.7 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The workforce reduction that occurred during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in Transition 2002, which resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2% of our workforce. The purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments. The workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 resulted in the termination of 130 employees, or approximately 3% of our workforce. The purpose of this workforce reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations, to strengthen key consulting practices, and to align our organizational structure to focus on client needs. During Calendar 2002, other charges were $49.4 million. These charges were the result of two actions, one during the first quarter of Calendar 2002 amounting to $17.2 million, and the other occurring during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2002, or Transition 2002, amounting to $32.2 million. Of the charges occurring during the first quarter of Calendar 2002, $10.0 million related to costs and losses associated with the elimination of excess facilities, principally leasehold improvements and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sub-lease arrangements. In addition, approximately $5.8 million of these charges were associated with our workforce reduction initiated during the first quarter of Calendar 2002 and were for employee termination severance and benefits. This workforce reduction resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2% of our workforce at that time. We expect the payments associated with the workforce reduction to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2004. The remaining $1.4 million of expenses recorded as other charges during the first quarter of Calendar 2002 relates to the impairment of certain database-related assets. Of the $32.2 million of charges during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2002, $13.3 million related to costs and losses associated with our elimination of excess facilities, principally leased facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sub-lease arrangements. The remaining $18.9 million of these charges related to severance payments and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction, which included $0.6 million of non-cash compensation. This workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of approximately 175 positions, or approximately 4% of our workforce at the time. Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2003 includes a $5.5 million insurance recovery received during Calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a business. Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2003 also includes an impairment loss of $0.9 million associated with a minority-owned investment not publicly traded. We evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity, which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value. The loss on investments during Calendar 2002 was caused primarily by the recognition of impairment losses related to equity securities owned by us through two limited partnerships, SI Venture Associates ( SI I ) and SI Venture Fund II ( SI II ). SI I and SI II are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid-stage IT-based or Internet-enabled companies. At December 31, 2002 we owned 100% of SI I and 34% of SI II. See Note 5 Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the gains and losses on investments. Interest expense decreased during Calendar 2003 due to the conversion of our debt to equity in October 2003. The conversion of our debt has eliminated most of our interest expense since the conversion date. Other income, net for Calendar 2003 of $0.5 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange gains. For Calendar 2002, other income, net of $0.1 million includes a $0.5 million gain from the sale of certain assets during the first quarter of Calendar 2002, partially offset by net foreign exchange losses. 16 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes was 33.4% and 37.7% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding the other charges for workforce reductions, excess facilities and asset impairments and the gains and losses from investments, the effective tax rate would have been 33% in Calendar 2003 as compared to 34% in Calendar 2002. The reduction in the effective tax rate for Calendar 2003, as compared to that of Calendar 2002, reflects the implementation of tax planning strategies. SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, and other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research Research revenues decreased 4% when comparing Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted research revenues by approximately 4%. The decrease in research revenues was due to the overall weakness in the economy and the impact of this weakness on corporate information technology spending causing lower demand throughout the entire technology sector. Research gross contribution of $292.9 million for Calendar 2003 decreased 8% from $318.7 million for Calendar 2002, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2003 decreased to 63% from 65% in the prior year. The decrease in gross contribution and gross contribution margin is a result of the lower revenues and costs associated with investments in Gartner EXP, Gartner G2, membership programs, product development and marketing and costs associated with customer intelligence. Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $482.2 million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of 1% from $489.0 million at December 31, 2002. However, research contract value increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2003 from $468.5 million at June 30, 2003 and $469.6 million at September 30, 2003. Prior to these sequential increases during Calendar 2003, contract value had decreased sequentially for five consecutive quarters. At December 31, 2003, our client retention rates increased 4 percentage points to 78% as compared to the same measure at December 31, 2002. Wallet retention increased 8 percentage points during Calendar 2003 to 89%. The client and wallet retention rates increased steadily over the four quarters of Calendar 2003. Consulting Consulting revenues decreased 6% during Calendar 2003 to $258.6 million from $276.1 million for Calendar 2002. Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately 5% during Calendar 2003. The decrease in revenues was caused by lower utilization. Billable headcount for our Consulting business as of December 31, 2003 increased to 526 at December 31, 2003 as compared to 459 at December 31, 2002. Consulting gross contribution of $86.8 million for Calendar 2003 decreased 16% from $102.8 million for Calendar 2002, and gross contribution margin for Calendar 2003 decreased to 34% from 37% in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to lower consultant utilization rates, which were approximately 53% during Calendar 2003 as compared to approximately 56% during Calendar 2002. Consulting backlog decreased 10% to $99.7 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $111.3 million at December 31, 2002, but increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2003, when it was $91.0 million at June 30, 2003 and $92.8 million at September 30, 2003. Consulting backlog decreased as compared to the prior year due to the decline in demand throughout the entire technology sector, as technology customers continued to constrain spending. Events Events revenues increased 9% to $119.4 million for Calendar 2003, compared to $109.7 million for Calendar 2002. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 5% favorable impact on revenues when comparing Calendar 2003 to Calendar 2002. Revenues have increased slightly despite having nine fewer events during Calendar 2003 as compared to Calendar 2002. The average revenue per event increased during Calendar 2003 due to the strong performance of our recurring events, as well as the addition of new events during Calendar 2003 that had higher revenues than the events that were eliminated. Gross contribution of $56.0 million for Calendar 2003 was relatively consistent with Calendar 2002. As a percentage of revenues, gross 17 Table of Contents contribution decreased to 47% during Calendar 2003 from 51% during Calendar 2002. The decrease in gross contribution margin was due primarily to increased personnel expenses and increased event marketing costs. During 2003, we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy, especially in the technology sector. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Calendar 2004 Cash provided by operating activities during Calendar 2004 totaled $48.3 compared to $136.3 million in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities of $88.0 million was due to several factors. We paid $27.0 million in bonuses during 2004 compared to zero in Calendar 2003. No bonuses were paid during Calendar 2003 as they had previously been paid during the quarter ended December 31, 2002 but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a result of our change in fiscal year that became effective January 1, 2003. As a result, the 2003 bonuses were paid in Calendar 2004. Further, we paid a portion of our 2004 bonuses in the third quarter of 2004 in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan. Additionally, cash from operating activities declined because we paid approximately $14.0 million more in severance during Calendar 2004 than in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was also due to the accelerated collection of receivables in Calendar 2003 which improved operating cash flow in that year by approximately $26.0 million, which was not repeated in Calendar 2004. Lastly, approximately $15.0 million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 were paid in the first quarter of 2004. Cash used in investing activities increased to $29.0 million during Calendar 2004 as compared to $25.4 million for Calendar 2003. The increase was primarily due to $3.9 million we prepaid related to the acquisition of META. Capital expenditures in Calendar 2004 of $25.1 million were 15% lower than the $28.9 million in Calendar 2003. During Calendar 2003, we received an insurance recovery of $5.5 million, and we funded $2.0 million of our capital commitment to SI II. Cash used by financing activities totaled $97.3 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $3.0 million used in Calendar 2003. We purchased $352.3 million of our common stock for treasury during Calendar 2004, of which $346.2 million represents the tender offer and Silver Lake repurchases, inclusive of related costs, as compared to $43.4 million during the prior year. We received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of $67.8 million during Calendar 2004, as compared to $41.7 million during the prior year. This increase is a result of higher stock option exercises by our employees as increases in our stock price caused a significantly larger percentage of our vested stock options to be in the money during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003. We borrowed $200 million related to the tender in the third quarter of Calendar 2004, receiving proceeds, net of debt issuance costs, of $197.2 million. We repaid $10 million of this debt in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, cash and cash equivalents totaled $160.1 million. The effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by $8.1 million during Calendar 2004, and was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Sterling. Calendar 2003 Cash provided by operating activities during Calendar 2003 was $136.3 million, compared to $145.8 million during Calendar 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash-related earnings and a smaller decrease in receivables during Calendar 2003 compared to Calendar 2002. Cash-related earnings are income from continuing operations adjusted for the non-cash items included in income, such as depreciation and amortization, the accretion of interest and amortization of debt issue costs, along with other non-cash charges. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher bonus payments during Calendar 2002. Bonus payments were higher during Calendar 2002 due to our change in fiscal year from September 30 to December 31, effective January 1, 2003. Our Fiscal 2002 bonuses were paid during Transition 2002, or the fourth quarter of Calendar 2002, whereas, Calendar 2003 bonuses were paid during 2004. Cash used in investing activities was $25.4 million for Calendar 2003, compared to $26.3 million for Calendar 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the proceeds received from an insurance recovery of $5.5 million during Calendar 2003 associated with a previously incurred loss on a claim resulting from the sale of a business in 2000. Additionally, during 2002 we spent $3.9 million to purchase the remaining 49.9% of People3, Inc. not previously owned by us. During Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002, we funded $2.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of our investment commitment to SI II, reducing our remaining commitment as of December 31, 2003 to $4.0 million. Spending on property and equipment increased $7.8 million to $28.9 million during Calendar 2003, as compared to $21.1 million during the same period of 2002. Cash used in financing activities totaled $3.0 million for Calendar 2003, compared to $42.2 million for Calendar 2002. We purchased $43.4 million of common stock for treasury during Calendar 2003, as compared to $59.9 million during Calendar 2002 (see further discussion that follows under Stock Repurchases). We received proceeds of $41.7 million from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of stock by employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan during Calendar 2003, as compared to $17.9 million during the Calendar 2002. At December 31, 2003, cash and cash equivalents totaled $230.0 million. The effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents 18 Table of Contents by $12.4 million during Calendar 2003, and was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies. Obligations and Commitments We have a Credit Agreement that provides for a $200.0 million term A loan facility and a five-year, $100 million revolving credit facility. During the third quarter of 2004, we borrowed $200 million under the term A loan facility, receiving net proceeds after debt issuance costs of $197.2 million. In accordance with the requirements of the term A loan facility, we made a loan payment of $10.0 million in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, there was $190 million outstanding on the term loan facility and $3.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Based on specified covenant requirements, our borrowing availability at December 31, 2004 under the revolving credit facility was $59.2 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we entered into an amendment of the Credit Agreement covenant requirements that resulted in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. As a result, the amended borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility would have been $96.5 million at December 31, 2004. The facilities bear interest equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin which varies based on specified leverage ratios. At December 31, 2004, the current interest rate was 3.59%. The term A loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments over a five-year period ending August 12, 2009. The credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayments from a portion of proceeds from asset sales and proceeds from certain future debt issuances. The credit agreement includes customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants primarily based on our financial results and other measures such as contract value. The facilities also include commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility not subject to letters of credit. On April 17, 2000, we issued, in a private placement transaction, $300.0 million of our unsecured 6% convertible subordinated notes due April 17, 2005 to Silver Lake and other noteholders. Interest accrued semi-annually by a corresponding increase in the face amount of the convertible notes. In October 2003, the notes were converted into 49,441,122 shares of Gartner Class A Common Stock. The conversion was in accordance with the original terms of the notes. The determination of the number of shares issued upon conversion was based upon a $7.45 conversion price and a convertible note of $368.3 million, consisting of the original face amount of $300 million plus accrued interest of $68.3 million. The unamortized balances of debt issue costs of $2.8 million and debt discount of $0.3 million as of the conversion date were netted against the outstanding principal and interest balances, resulting in a $365.2 million increase to stockholders equity. Additionally, certain costs directly associated with the conversion, such as regulatory filings, banking and legal fees totaling $0.6 million were charged to equity. The following table represents our contractual commitments at December 31, 2004 (in millions): Less Than 1 - 3 4 - 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases $ 206.9 $ 29.9 $ 44.0 $ 37.1 $ 95.9 Senior credit facility 190.0 40.0 80.0 70.0 Severance associated with workforce reductions 9.3 8.3 1.0 Miscellaneous service agreements 1.8 1.8 META acquisition obligation 1.7 1.7 Totals $ 409.7 $ 81.7 $ 125.0 $ 107.1 $ 95.9 On December 27, 2004, we announced that we would acquire META in an all-cash transaction for $10.00 per share, or approximately $162.0 million, excluding transaction costs. While subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals, we expect the transaction to be effective April 1, 2005. The $1.7 million of META acquisition obligation in the table above relates to additional nonrefundable acquisition expenses that we are obligated to pay. In order to fund the purchase of META, we anticipate that we will use a combination of cash and our amended five-year revolving credit facility. In connection with funding the META transaction, we anticipate repatriating $52.0 million in cash earnings from our non-US subsidiaries in early 2005. We believe that our existing cash balances, together with cash from our operating activities and the additional borrowing capacity under our amended five-year revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term needs. We are currently evaluating the option of establishing long-term debt as a permanent part of our capital structure. However, there can be no assurances that such capital will be available to us or will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Tender Offer On August 10, 2004, we announced the final results of our Dutch auction tender offer. We repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares of our Class A Common Stock and 5.5 million shares of our Class B Common Stock at a purchase price of $13.30 and $12.50 per share, respectively. 19 Table of Contents Additionally, we repurchased 9.2 million Class A shares from Silver Lake and certain of its affiliates, which collectively owned approximately 44.4% of our Class A Common Stock and are affiliated with two members of our Board of Directors, at a purchase price of $13.30 per share. The total cost of the purchases was $346.2 million, including transaction costs of $3.8 million. Stock Repurchases In July 2001, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of Class A and Class B Common Stock. The Board of Directors subsequently increased the authorized stock repurchase program to a total authorization for repurchase of $200.0 million.

In addition, we and our clients are affected by the economy. The following section discusses many, but not all, of these risks and uncertainties. Economic Conditions . Our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and more particularly by business conditions in the IT industry. A general economic downturn or recession, anywhere in the world, could negatively affect demand for our products and services and may further substantially reduce existing and potential client information technology-related budgets. The economic downturn in the United States and globally has led to constrained IT spending, which has impacted our business and if it were to continue could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the ability to: maintain client retention, wallet retention and consulting utilization rates, and achieve contract value and consulting backlog. To the extent our clients are in the IT industry, the severe decline in that sector has also had a significant impact on their spending. Organizational and Product Integration Related to Acquisitions . We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products and services, including our pending acquisition of META. The risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition, dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital, increased indebtedness, the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks, the ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired business, the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company, the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired company, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business. The realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business. Restructuring, Reorganization and Management Team. Our future success depends, in significant part, upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. We have recently reorganized our business around specific client needs. As part of this reorganization, a number of key management positions have been filled by the promotion of current employees or the hiring of new employees. Additionally, we have restructured our workforce in order to streamline operations and strengthen key consulting practices. If the reorganization and restructuring of our business does not lead to the results we expect, our ability to effectively deliver our products, manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired. On July 23, 2004, we announced that the Board of Directors named Eugene A. Hall as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hall succeeded Michael Fleisher, who had previously announced his intention to depart as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, James C. Smith, a current Board member, has been named non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors. Further, on September 28, 2004, we announced that the position of President and Chief Operating Officer, previously held by Maureen O Connell, was eliminated and that Mr. Hall would assume direct responsibility for business operations. If we cannot successfully integrate our Chief Executive Officer into our senior management team, then our ability to effectively deliver our products, manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired. Acts of Terrorism or War. Acts of terrorism, acts of war and other unforeseen events, may cause damage or disruption to our properties, business, employees, suppliers, distributors and clients, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Competitive Environment . We face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services, including information that can be found on the Internet free of charge. We also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic and print media companies, some of which may have greater financial, information gathering and marketing resources than we do. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. Additionally, technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources. Increased competition may result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures. We may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis, timely delivery of information, customer service, the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis, or price. Renewal of Research Business by Existing Clients. Some of our success depends on renewals of our subscription-based research products and services, which constituted 54% of our revenues for Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003. These research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months. Our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors, including those described in this Annual Report. Additionally, as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs, we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates. While client retention rates were 80% at December 31, 2004 and 78% at December 31, 2003, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to have this level of client renewals. Any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition. Non-Recurring Consulting Engagements. Consulting segment revenues constituted 29% of our revenues for Calendar 2004 and 30% of our revenues for Calendar 2003. These consulting engagements typically are project-based and non-recurring. Our ability to replace 21 Table of Contents consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors, including those described in this Annual Report. Any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition. Hiring and Retention of Employees . Our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management, research analysts, consultants, sales and other key personnel. We face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from, among others, technology companies, market research firms, consulting firms, financial services companies and electronic and print media companies, some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals. Some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non-compete agreements that could impede our short-term recruitment efforts. Any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business, could adversely affect the quality of our products and services, and therefore, our future business and operating results. Maintenance of Existing Products and Services . We operate in a rapidly evolving market, and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients. Any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results. Further, if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research, our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline. In addition, we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a cost-effective manner. Failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating results. Introduction of New Products and Services . The market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis. To maintain our competitive position, we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services, develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner, and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them. Any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position. International Operations . A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of North America, 37% for Calendar 2004. As a result, our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including general political and economic conditions in each country, changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs and other trade barriers, challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, different or overlapping tax structures, higher levels of United States taxation on foreign income, and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions. We rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations. If any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis. Additionally, clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent. Branding . We believe that our Gartner brand is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases. We may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the Gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget, hire additional marketing and public relations personnel, expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty. If we fail to effectively promote and maintain the Gartner brand, or incur excessive expenses in doing so, our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted. Indebtedness . We have a $200.0 million senior revolving credit facility as well as a $100 million revolving credit facility. The affirmative, negative and financial covenants of the credit facility could limit our future financial flexibility. As a result of these covenants, our borrowing availability at December 31, 2004 was $59.2 million, and would have been $96.5 million based on an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The associated debt service costs of these facilities could impair our future operating results. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us, which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital. Enforcement of Our Intellectual Property Rights . We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. Our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us. The laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Our employees are subject to non-compete agreements. When the non-competition period expires, former employees may compete against us. If a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non-competition period, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the non-compete provision. Possibility of Infringement Claims . Third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Regardless of the merits, responding to any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may 22 Table of Contents not be offered or available on reasonable terms. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected. Potential Fluctuations in Operating Results . Our quarterly and annual operating income may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors, including the timing of the execution of research contracts, which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter, the extent of completion of consulting engagements, the timing of symposia and other events, which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter, the amount of new business generated, the mix of domestic and international business, changes in market demand for our products and services, the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services, and competition in the industry. An inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow, and achieve our forecasts, may impact our operating and other activities. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. Significant Stockholders . Silver Lake and its affiliates own approximately 42.2% of our Class A Common Stock and approximately 33.7% of our total common stock on a combined basis as of February 28, 2005. Currently, the owners of our Class A Common Stock are only entitled to vote for two of the ten members of our Board of Directors and vote together with the holders of the Class B Common Stock as a single class on all other matters coming before the stockholders. Silver Lake is restricted from purchasing additional stock without our consent pursuant to the terms of a Securityholders Agreement. This Securityholders Agreement also provides that we cannot take certain actions, including acquisitions and sales of stock and/or assets without Silver Lake consent. Additionally, ValueAct Partners and its affiliates own approximately 13.0% of our Class A Common Stock, 22.7% of our Class B Common Stock and 14.9% of our total common stock on a combined basis as of February 28, 2005. While neither Silver Lake nor ValueAct holds a majority of our outstanding shares, they may be able, either individually or together, to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and sales of our assets. Their interests may differ from the interests of other stockholders. Anti-takeover Protections . Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions include: The presence of a classified Board of Directors; The existence of two classes of common stock with our Class B Common Stock having the ability to elect 80% of our Board of Directors; The ability of our Board of Directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock; Advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings; A preferred shares rights agreement; and The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law. These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their Common Stock. We have announced that we intend to eliminate our classified board structure and combine our two classes of common stock, subject to the approval of our stockholders, at our next annual meeting of stockholders to be held in the late spring or early summer of 2005. These actions could serve to make it easier for a change of control to occur. Non-Cash Compensation Charges in Future Periods. On October 15, 2004, we announced that Eugene A. Hall received an inducement grant of 500,000 shares of restricted stock with a market value on the date of grant of $12.05 per share. As long as Mr. Hall remains an employee, the restriction on the 500,000 shares of restricted stock will lapse upon the earlier of (a) our 60 day average stock price meeting certain targets, or (b) a change in control. The price targets are $20 for the first 300,000 shares, $25 for the next 100,000 shares and $30 for the remaining 100,000 shares. If our 60 day average stock price exceeds the stipulated per share target during the 60 day measurement period, we will be required to record a non-cash compensation charge equal to the closing price of our stock on the date the target is met times the number of shares associated with the applicable target. For example, if our average 60 days stock price is $22 per share and the stock closes at $22.50 per share, the first lapse shall result in us recording a $6.75 million non-cash compensation charge (300,000 shares at $22.50/share). RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123R, Share-Based Payments ( SFAS 123R ). The rule replaces SFAS No. 123 and APB 25 and will require the recognition of expense for share-based payments, to include the value of stock options granted to employees. The revised rule is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005, but early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt the new rule on July 1, 2005. We are currently assessing the impact the revised rule will have on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations, but we believe it may have a material effect on our results of operations. 23 Table of Contents
