ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2014 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of our revenues by segment and our expenses from a consolidated perspective for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent material to the understanding of segment profitability, we more fully describe the segment expenses per financial statement line item. We believe this analysis will help the reader better understand our consolidated statements of operations. Financial and statistical data is also included here. This section also includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2015 . Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations, commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements, and an overview of financial position. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW Our 2014 consolidated pretax income was $975 million compared to $816 million in 2013 . The $159 million improvement was primarily due to the net increase of $212 million in revenues, a decrease of $49 million in our fuel expense, and $13 million in non-operating income compared to a non-operating loss of $22 million in the prior year. Partially offsetting these benefits was an increase in non-fuel operating expenses of $167 million , or 6% , to support the increased capacity of 7% . The growth in revenues of $212 million was primarily due to an increase in passenger revenue of $312 million resulting from a 6.5% increase in traffic and 0.7% higher ticket yields, partially offset by a special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million resulting from the adoption of new accounting standards in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in wages and benefits, contracted services and depreciation expense as we expanded our fleet and entered into new markets where we almost exclusively use vendors for our station operations. See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

(Dulles) Daily 3/11/2015 Seattle to Milwaukee Daily 7/1/2015 Seattle to Oklahoma City Daily 7/1/2015 Portland to St. Louis Daily 7/1/2015 Capital Allocation In 2014 , we repurchased 7,316,731 shares of our common stock for $348 million under the share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Since 2007, we have repurchased 49 million shares of common stock under such programs for $827 million for an average price of approximately $17 per share. In 2014 , we increased our quarterly dividend 25% from $0.10 per share to $0.125 per share, and subsequent to December 31, 2014 , we announced a 60% increase to $0.20 per share. Overall, we returned $416 million to shareholders during 2014 and expect to exceed that amount in 2015. 28 Outlook Our primary focus every year is to run safe, compliant and reliable operations at our airlines. In addition to our primary objective, we will remain focused on providing a hassle-free experience for our customers, and building a compelling brand to support network growth. Specifically, we will continue to improve our in-flight experience with our Alaska Beyond in-flight experience featuring Tom Douglas signature meals, new streaming in-flight entertainment, comfortable Recaro seats with power at every seat, and our award-winning customer service. Currently, we see strong demand for 2015, and because of our strong balance sheet and the structure of our fleet, we will flex our fleet to meet demand and allocate capacity in the markets that meet our return objectives. This includes our expectation to grow departures out of Seattle by 10% in 2015. Additionally, competitive capacity is expected to be 15% higher in the first quarter and 12% higher in 2015 based on current schedules. We expect Delta Air Lines, our largest direct competitor, to increase its overlapping capacity from 41% in 2014 to 50% in 2015. Long-term, we plan to vigorously defend our markets through great customer service, Mileage Plan promotions, schedule changes, community events, and additional advertising efforts. We will also continue to focus on lowering unit costs so that we can compete more effectively. Furthermore, the significant decline in fuel prices over the past several months improves our financial outlook as fuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Given our current fleet plan, we expect capacity to increase approximately 11% in the first quarter of 2015 and between 9% and 10% for the full-year 2015. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2014 COMPARED WITH 2013 Our consolidated net income for 2014 was $605 million , or $4.42 per diluted share, compared to net income of $508 million , or $3.58 per diluted share, in 2013 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2014 , we recognized net mark-to-market adjustments of $23 million ( $15 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) compared to gains of $8 million ( $5 million after tax, or $0.03 per share) in 2013 . In 2014 , we recognized a one-time, non-cash benefit from the curtailment of certain post-retirement benefit plans of $20 million and a one-time gain associated with the settlement of a legal matter of $10 million . The aggregate $30 million ( $19 million in aggregate after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share) is included in Special items in the consolidated statement of operations. In 2013 , we recognized a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million ( $120 million after tax, or $0.85 per diluted share) that resulted from the application of new accounting rules associated with the modified Bank of America Affinity Card Agreement, and the effect of an increase in the estimate of the number of frequent flier miles expected to expire unused. ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains or losses or other individual revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because: We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts; By eliminating fuel expense and certain special items from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of our non-fuel continuing operations. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management; 29 Prior year Operating revenue per ASM (RASM) excludes a favorable, one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million primarily related to our modified affinity card agreement with Bank of America, executed in July 2013. In accordance with accounting standards, we recorded this item in the third quarter of 2013, and it reflects a non-cash adjustment of the value of miles outstanding in the program. We believe it is appropriate to exclude this special revenue item from recurring revenues from operations; CASM excluding fuel and special items is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance; Our results excluding fuel expense and special items serve as the basis for our various employee incentive plans, thus the information allows investors to better understand the changes in variable incentive pay expense in our consolidated statements of operations; and It is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to those of other airlines. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, special items, and the one-time Special mileage plan revenue item, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2014 was $571 million , or $4.18 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $383 million , or $2.70 per share, in 2013 .

Adjusted for the Special mileage plan revenue item recognized in 2013, operating revenues increased $404 million , or 8% during 2014. The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,774 $ 3,490 8 Regional 805 777 4 Total passenger revenue $ 4,579 $ 4,267 7 Freight and mail 114 113 1 Other - net 675 584 16 Special mileage plan revenue 192 NM Total operating revenues $ 5,368 $ 5,156 4 NM - Not meaningful Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2014 increased by 8% on a 6.6% increase in capacity and a 1.4% increase in PRASM compared to 2013 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes, seats added to our existing fleet as part of our cabin improvement project, and delivery of 10 737-900ERs in 2014 . The increase in PRASM was driven by a 1.9% increase in ticket yield, partially offset by a 0.4 point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. Increase in yield was due to reallocation of capacity to markets with stronger demand and by a change in revenue allocation between Mainline and Regional service because of certain industry pricing changes. Without the industry change, Mainline yields would have increased by 0.9%. We expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2015. However, we expect total passenger revenue to increase with the expected 8% growth in our capacity. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $28 million , or 4% , compared to 2013 on an 11.9% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 7.3% decrease in PRASM compared to 2013 . The decrease in PRASM was due to a 6.2% decrease in ticket yield coupled with a 1.0 point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. The decline in yield was driven mostly by a change in revenue allocation between Mainline and Regional service because of certain industry pricing changes. Without the revenue allocation adjustment, yield would have decreased 1.7%. Additionally, the average trip length for our Regional flights increased 3%, which also put downward pressure on yields. We expect Regional passenger revenue to increase in 2015, primarily due to our expanded capacity purchase agreement with SkyWest to fly E-175 regional aircraft beginning in the third quarter of 2015. These aircraft will offer three booking classes. Other Net Other net revenue increased $91 million , or 16% , from 2013 . This is primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of $39 million or 15% , due to increase in miles sold and an increase in cash received per mile. Additionally, bag fees and ticket change fees are up 23% and 12%, respectively, due to changes in our fee structure that took effect in November 2013. We expect our Other net revenue to increase in 2015 as we provide more product offerings and have more passengers. Special Mileage Plan Revenue In 2013, we modified and extended our co-branded credit card agreement with Bank of America Corporation (BAC). In connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards, we recorded a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to BAC. 33 OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $88 million , or 2% , compared to 2013 , primarily driven by higher non-fuel costs due to increased capacity. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,418 $ 1,467 (3 ) Non-fuel expenses 3,018 2,851 6 Special items (30 ) NM Total Operating Expenses $ 4,406 $ 4,318 2 NM - Not Meaningful Significant operating expense variances from 2013 are more fully described below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2014 by $50 million , or 5% , compared to 2013 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2014 2013 % Change Wages $ 862 $ 788 9 Medical and other benefits 150 145 3 Defined contribution plans 53 44 20 Pension - Defined benefit plans 9 50 (82 ) Payroll taxes 62 59 5 Total wages and benefits $ 1,136 $ 1,086 5 Wages increased 9% , primarily due to annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates, a 4.7% increase in full-time employee equivalents, and an $8 million signing bonus paid to Alaska's flight attendants in December 2014 when a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified. The increase in FTEs is to support the growth in our business. Defined contribution plans increased 20% due to an increase in the number of employees participating in the plans and an increase in the employer contribution for non-union employees previously in the pension plan. Pension expense decreased 82% , compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets, a higher discount rate at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012, and the freezing of plan benefits for our non-union employees beginning January 1, 2014. We expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2015 compared to 2014 on a 3% to 4% increase in FTEs and higher pension expense of approximately $20 million. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $105 million in 2013 to $116 million in 2014 . The increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year in addition to a higher wage base. We expect variable incentive pay in 2015 to be lower due to changes to our incentive pay metrics to reflect our improving performance. However, actual amounts could differ based on 2015 performance. 34 Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. Aircraft fuel expense decreased $49 million , or 3% compared to 2013 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 2013 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,400 $ 2.99 $ 1,423 $ 3.19 (Gains) losses on settled hedges 41 0.09 52 0.11 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,441 $ 3.08 $ 1,475 $ 3.30 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (23 ) (0.05 ) (8 ) (0.02 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 1,418 $ 3.03 $ 1,467 $ 3.28 Fuel gallons 469 447 Fuel gallons consumed increased 4.9% in line with the increase in departures and capacity, partially offset by a 2.1% improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by ASMs per gallon. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 6.3% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2014 was due to a decrease in average crude oil prices of 5.2% and decrease in refining margins of 15.7% , as compared to the prior year. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from, or pay to, hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $41 million in 2014 , compared to losses of $52 million in 2013 . These amounts represent the cash received, or paid, net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges. In the third quarter of 2014 , we discontinued the hedge program for refining margins. We currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 41.0% lower in the first quarter of 2015 than the first quarter of 2014 due to lower West Coast jet fuel prices and the decrease in premium costs related to our fuel hedge program. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance decreased by $18 million , or 7% , compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a $22 million reduction in our power-by-the-hour (PBH) expense, $11 million in lower lease return costs, and five fewer unscheduled engine checks for our Q400 aircraft. Offsetting these decreases was an $11 million increase in engine maintenance expense primarily related to our 737-400 engines, and slightly higher airframe checks for both our 737 and Q400 fleet. The decrease in our PBH expense is due to fewer engines covered by the contracts in the current year, along with reduced flying on the engines that are still under the current contract. The decrease is return costs is due to the four aircraft we returned 35 during the current year and two aircraft we returned at the end of the prior year with no lease return costs expected for lease returns in 2015. We expect aircraft maintenance to be 10% to 15% higher in 2015 due to an increase in our engine maintenance expense for both fleet types. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rental expenses increased $17 million , or 6% , primarily due to increased flying in 2014 as we increased capacity and entered into new markets. We expect landing fees and other rental expenses to increase in 2015 due to the expected capacity growth. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $33 million , or 15% , including $15 million additional purchased capacity from SkyWest and $15 million increased contract ramp and passenger handling costs resulting from new stations and rate increases in Seattle. We expect contracted services to be higher in 2015 , as we expand into new stations and start E-175 flying with SkyWest. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $20 million , or 11% , compared to 2013 , mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in Seattle and increased credit card commissions from higher revenue. We expect selling expense to increase in 2015 , reflecting our growth in passengers. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $24 million , or 9% , due to increased number of aircraft in our fleet. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase approximately 15% in the next year as we continue to purchase aircraft and make other customer focused investments. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expenses increased by $9 million , or 11% , due to the increased number of passengers, and more premium product offerings. We expect food and beverage expenses to outpace passenger growth in 2015 , as we invest more in our onboard product. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $30 million , or 11% , compared to 2013 . The increase is primarily driven by IT project costs, higher professional fees, and flight crew hotel costs. We expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2015 due to additional training costs, and other personnel expenses. Special Items In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded special items for $30 million . This is primarily due to a $20 million non-cash curtailment gain related to certain post-retirement benefits that were reduced in 2014. The remaining gain is related to a one-time cash settlement related to a legal matter. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2014, we recorded nonoperating income of $13 million , compared to an expense of $22 million in 2013. The $35 million favorable change is due to gains recorded in the current year related to the sale of certain equity securities and reduced 36 interest expense due to lower average debt levels. Additionally, in the prior year, we incurred costs of $12 million to overhaul and repair three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier. Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile We are presenting our line-item expenses below both in absolute dollars and on an ASM basis to highlight areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity.

Additional Segment Information Refer to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. Alaska Mainline Pretax profit for Alaska Mainline was $834 million in 2014 compared to $530 million in 2013 . The $284 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue is described previously. Mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by $124 million , due to increased capacity, departures, expanding to new locations, and higher advertising and promotional activity in Seattle and our new locations. Additionally, we increased spending on IT infrastructure projects, and incurred more depreciation as we continue to purchase aircraft. Economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to a decline in the economic price per gallon, and increased fuel efficiency, slightly offset by an increase in consumption. Alaska Regional Pretax profit for Alaska Regional was $74 million in 2014 compared to $69 million in 2013 . The $28 million increase in Alaska Regional passenger revenue is described previously. The increased Regional revenue was offset by higher expenses to support additional capacity. Additionally, we recorded a $12 million loss in 2013 related to overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $17 million in 2014 compared to $20 million in 2013 . CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) increased due to additional capacity in the state of Alaska. The $8 million increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was driven by increased wages to support additional aircraft in the fleet, higher pilot training costs, and increased depreciation and amortization due to the three additional Q400 aircraft added in Q4 of 2013. 37 2013 COMPARED WITH 2012 Our consolidated net income for 2013 was $508 million , or $3.58 per diluted share, compared to net income of $316 million , or $2.20 per diluted share, in 2012 . Significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows: Both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses related to our fuel hedge positions. For 2013 , we recognized net mark-to-market gains of $8 million ( $5 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) compared to losses of $38 million ( $23 million after tax, or $0.17 per share) in 2012 . In 2013 , we recognized a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million ( $120 million after tax, or $0.85 per diluted share) that resulted from the application of new accounting rules associated with the modified Bank of America Affinity Card Agreement, and the effect of an increase in the estimate of the number of frequent flier miles expected to expire unused. Excluding the mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, and the one-time Special mileage plan revenue item, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2013 was $383 million , or $2.70 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $339 million , or $2.37 per share, in 2012 .

The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,490 $ 3,284 6 Regional 777 746 4 Total passenger revenue $ 4,267 $ 4,030 6 Freight and mail 113 111 2 Other - net 584 516 13 Special mileage plan revenue 192 NM Total operating revenues $ 5,156 $ 4,657 11 NM - Not meaningful Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2013 increased by 6% on a 7.9% increase in capacity and a 1.5% increase in PRASM compared to 2012 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2013 and larger aircraft. The decrease in PRASM was driven by a 0.9% decrease in ticket yield and a 0.5 point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. Increased competition in the state of Alaska and along the west coast put downward pressures on yield and load factor. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $31 million , or 4% , compared to 2012 on a 0.4% increase in capacity and 3.7% increase in PRASM compared to 2012 . The increase in PRASM was due to a 1.4% increase in ticket yield coupled with a 1.8 point increase in load factor compared to the prior year. The increase in regional revenues is due to better matching the right aircraft with the right market to avoid over-supply of capacity and maintaining yields and load factors. Freight and Mail Freight and mail revenue increased $2 million , or 2% , primarily due to increased freight volumes. Other Net Other net revenue increased $68 million , or 13% , from 2012 . This is primarily due to an increase in our Mileage Plan revenues of $47 million or 22%, as a result of a higher rate per mile sold to Bank of America Corporation (BAC) under our new affinity card program and growth in the Mileage Plan program. Additionally, bag fees increased by 7.8%, and change fees increased by 7.3%, due to increases in the number of passengers. Special Mileage Plan Revenue In 2013, we modified and extended our co-branded credit card agreement with BAC. In connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards, we recorded a one-time, non-cash Special mileage plan revenue item of $192 million primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to BAC. 39 OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $193 million , or 5% , compared to 2012 , primarily driven by wages and variable incentive pay. Fuel expense remained flat due to a decrease in fuel cost per gallon offset by an increase in fuel consumption. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2011 % Change Fuel expense $ 1,467 $ 1,459 1 Non-fuel expenses 2,851 2,666 7 Total Operating Expenses $ 4,318 $ 4,125 5 Significant operating expense variances from 2012 are more fully described below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2013 by $48 million , or 5% , compared to 2012 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 2012 % Change Wages $ 788 $ 742 6 Pension - Defined benefit plans 50 57 (12 ) Defined contribution plans 44 43 2 Medical and other benefits 145 138 5 Payroll taxes 59 58 2 Total wages and benefits $ 1,086 $ 1,038 5 Wages increased 6% , primarily due to a ratified contract with Alaska's pilots that was effective April 1, 2013. Additionally, we hired 2% more FTEs to support increased flying and other strategic initiatives, such as IT and hassle-free projects. Pension expense decreased 12% , compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets and improved funded status compared to the prior year. Medical benefits increased 5% from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee health-care claims and an increase in the cost of health care services. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased from $88 million in 2012 to $105 million in 2013 . The increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year. 40 Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense increased $8 million , or 1% compared to 2012 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 2012 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 1,423 $ 3.19 $ 1,397 $ 3.31 Gains on settled hedges 52 0.11 24 0.06 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 1,475 $ 3.30 $ 1,421 $ 3.37 Mark-to-mark fuel hedge adjustments (8 ) (0.02 ) 38 0.09 GAAP fuel expense $ 1,467 $ 3.28 $ 1,459 $ 3.46 Fuel gallons 447 422 Fuel gallons consumed increased 5.9% in line with the increase in departures and capacity. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 3.6% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2013 was due to a decline in refining margins of 27%, offset by the increase in average crude oil prices of 4%, as compared to the prior year. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $52 million in 2013, compared to losses of $24 million in 2012. These amounts represent the cash received, or paid, net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance increased by $25 million , or 11% , compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $14 million increase in lease return provisions. During the year we modified one of our power-by-the-hour agreements and terminated another related to our B737 fleet, resulting in a decrease in expense under those agreements but an increase in engine events and related expense that we are now responsible for. For our B737 and Q400 fleets, we also experienced heavier, more expensive checks, on flat volumes. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $19 million , or 8% , primarily due to the increase in rates from the Port of Seattle lease signed in late 2013. Additionally, we experienced increased rates throughout our network with increased departures and passengers. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $21 million , or 11% , primarily due to more capacity purchase flying with SkyWest and higher rates with PenAir. Additionally, we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling costs, and other services as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $11 million , or 6% , compared to 2012 as a result of higher commissions with credit cards and interline commissions related to international routes. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $30 million , or 13% , compared to 2012 . The increase is driven by a variety of factors such as higher professional fees, IT costs, losses on the disposal of assets, property taxes, and new uniforms. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) Net nonoperating expense increased $4 million from 2012. This is due to the overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier. Partially offsetting the sublease loss was a gain on the sale of equity securities. 41 Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2013 2012 %Change (in millions, except CASM) Amount Amount CASM CASM CASM Wages and benefits $ 1,086 $ 1,038 3.23 3.30 (2.1 )% Variable incentive pay 105 88 0.31 0.28 10.7 % Aircraft maintenance 247 222 0.73 0.71 2.8 % Aircraft rent 119 116 0.35 0.37 (5.4 )% Landing fees and other rentals 262 243 0.78 0.77 1.3 % Contracted services 221 200 0.66 0.64 3.1 % Selling expenses 179 168 0.53 0.53 % Depreciation and amortization 270 264 0.80 0.84 (4.8 )% Food and beverage service 84 79 0.25 0.25 % Other 278 248 0.83 0.79 5.1 % Non-fuel Expenses $ 2,851 $ 2,666 8.47 8.48 (0.1 )% Additional Segment Information Refer to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. Alaska Mainline Pretax profit for Alaska Mainline was $530 million in 2013 compared to $466 million in 2012. The $206 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue is described previously, as well as the increased revenues from the modified credit card agreement. Mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by $162 million, driven mainly by increased wages and incentive pay, increased rates and volumes on landing fees and rents, and increased other expenses to support our growth in operations. Economic fuel cost as defined above increased due to a 6.8% increase in consumption, on a slight decrease in the economic price per gallon. Alaska Regional Pretax profit for Alaska Regional was $69 million in 2013 compared to $62 million in 2012. The $31 million increase in Alaska Regional passenger revenue is described previously. Alaska Regional expenses were slightly higher due to additional flying by SkyWest and higher rates from PenAir, and increased landing fees and rents due to increased flying and higher rates. Also impacting pretax profit is the $12 million loss due to the overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $20 million in 2013 compared to $24 million in 2012. CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) decreased due to lower operational incentives being met. The $3 million increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was driven by wages and incentive pay, and an increase in airframe checks and other unscheduled events. 42 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.2 billion , and our expected cash from operations; Our 76 unencumbered aircraft in our operating fleet as of December 31, 2014 , that could be financed, if necessary; Our combined $200 million bank line-of-credit facilities, with none currently outstanding; In 2014 , we took free and clear delivery of ten B737-900ER aircraft. We made debt payments totaling $119 million . In addition, we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing $348 million of our common stock in 2014 , and paid dividends totaling $68 million . Because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance, in 2014 we became one of only two airlines in the U.S. with investment grade credit ratings. We will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. Our investment portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives, approved and prohibited investments, and duration and credit quality guidelines. Our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Change Cash and marketable securities $ 1,217 $ 1,330 $ (113 ) Cash, marketable securities, and unused lines of credit as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue (a) 26 % 31 % (5 ) pts Long-term debt, net of current portion 686 754 (68 ) Shareholders equity 2,127 2,029 98 Long-term debt-to-capital ratio (b) 31%:69% 35%:65% (4 ) pts (a) Excludes Special mileage plan revenue item. (b) Calculated using the present value of remaining aircraft lease payments for aircraft that are in our operating fleet as of the balance sheet date. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities In 2014 , we generated over $1 billion in operating cash flows compared to $981 million in 2013 . The increase of $49 million is primarily due to an increase in earnings, an increase in our advance ticket sales, and a decrease in pension contributions, partially offset by a $177 million increase in payments for income taxes. Cash provided by operating activities was $981 million in 2013 , compared to $753 million in 2012 . The $228 million increase is primarily due to an increase in revenues, excluding Special mileage plan revenue item, an increase in cash receipts related to our Mileage Plan program, decrease in pension contributions, and cash savings in 2013 as we shortened the tenor of our fuel hedge program. Partially offsetting these increases were additional cash paid in taxes, and an increase in operating expenses to support the growth in revenues. 43 We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures and increasing shareholder value by stock repurchases and dividends. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $541 million during 2014 , compared to $698 million in 2013 . Our capital expenditures were $694 million , or $128 million higher than in 2013 . This is due to the delivery of ten B737-900ERs, the completion of our B737 cabin improvement project, and the exercise of 16 B737 options, two Q400 options, and deposits for an incremental Q400. This compares to the delivery of nine B737-900ERs and three Q400s in the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we had firm commitments for 73 B737 aircraft through 2022 with options to acquire up to 48 additional 737 NextGen (NG) aircraft and MAX aircraft in 2017 through 2024 . We also have options to acquire five Q400 aircraft with deliveries from 2018 to 2019. The options for all fleet types give us the flexibility, but not the obligation, to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met. The table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised. Included in the table are six new aircraft, two of which are options exercises and four of which are expected new aircraft orders approved by the Board of Directors on February 10, 2015. These aircraft are expected to be delivered in 2016 and 2017. Additional options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met: 2014 Actuals 2015 2016 2017 2018 Aircraft and aircraft purchase deposits - firm $ 498 $ 580 $ 535 $ 485 $ 405 Other flight equipment 131 50 35 25 25 Other property and equipment 65 120 80 80 80 Total property and equipment additions $ 694 $ 750 $ 650 $ 590 $ 510 Option aircraft and aircraft deposits, if exercised $ $ $ 35 $ 145 $ 315 Cash used in investing activities was $698 million during 2013, compared to $645 million in 2012. Our capital expenditures were $566 million, or $48 million higher than in 2012. This is due to the delivery of nine B737-900ER aircraft, and three Q400 aircraft, compared to four B737-900ER aircraft, three B737-800 aircraft, and two Q400 aircraft in the prior year. Cash Used by Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $462 million during 2014 , compared to $325 million in 2013 . During the current year, we made debt payments of $119 million , stock repurchases of $348 million , and cash dividend payments of $68 million , partially offset by proceeds from debt of $51 million . In 2013 , we made debt payments of $161 million , stock repurchases of $159 million , and cash dividend payments of $28 million. In 2012, we made debt payments of $275 million and stock repurchases of $60 million, which was offset by proceeds from a reimbursement for our Los Angeles International Airport T6 project of $178 million. We plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Line-of-Credit Facility The Company has two $100 million credit facilities. Both facilities have variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus a specified margin. One of the $100 million facilities, which expires in September 2017 , is secured by aircraft. The other $100 million facility is secured by certain accounts receivable, spare engines, spare parts and ground service equipment, and expires March 2017 . The Company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments At December 31, 2014, we had firm orders to purchase 76 aircraft. In addition, we had options to acquire 48 additional B737 aircraft and options to acquire five Q400 aircraft. Also, we have options to add regional capacity by having SkyWest operate up to 16 more E-175 aircraft than the seven aircraft we already have committed. 44 The following table summarizes our projected fleet count by year, as of February 11, 2015 : Actual Fleet Count Expected Fleet Activity (a) Aircraft Dec 31, 2013 Dec 31, 2014 2015 Changes Dec 31, 2015 2016 - 2017 Changes Dec 31, 2017 B737 Freighters & Combis 6 6 6 (3 ) 3 B737 Passenger Aircraft (b) 125 131 10 141 9 150 Total Mainline Fleet 131 137 10 147 6 153 Q400 51 51 1 52 2 54 E-175 (c) 5 5 2 7 CRJ700 (c) 8 8 8 8 Total Regional Fleet 59 59 6 65 4 69 Total 190 196 16 212 10 222 (a) The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 are subject to change. (b) 2015 changes include the expected delivery of 11 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft offset by the scheduled return of one 737-400 aircraft to the lessor. (c) Aircraft are operated under capacity purchase agreements with a third party. For future firm orders and option exercises, we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash, long-term debt, or lease arrangements. Future Fuel Hedge Positions All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases; and, during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2015 50% $105 $4 Second Quarter 2015 50% $97 $3 Third Quarter 2015 40% $98 $3 Fourth Quarter 2015 30% $94 $3 Full Year 2015 42% $99 $3 First Quarter 2016 20% $88 $3 Second Quarter 2016 10% $73 $4 Full Year 2016 7% $83 $3 45 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2014 .

(c) Includes minimum obligations under our long-term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements and obligations associated with third-party CPAs with SkyWest and PenAir. Refer to the "Commitments" note in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Defined Benefit Pensions The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, which could be approximately $30 to $35 million in 2015, although there is no minimum required contribution. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $133 million at December 31, 2014 , compared to a $60 million overfunded position at December 31, 2013 . This results in a 94% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 104% funded as of December 31, 2013 . Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed. Deferred Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the majority of our assets, as measured by value, are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated, which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices, level of pension funding (which is generally not known until late each year), whether "bonus depreciation" provisions are available, as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control. In 2014 , we made tax payments of $326 million , and had an effective tax rate of 37.9% . In early 2015 , we will receive a tax refund of approximately $80 million primarily due to an overpayment of estimated tax prior to bonus depreciation legislation enacted late in 2014 . We believe that we have the liquidity to make our future tax payments. 46 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A are based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. MILEAGE PLAN Our Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners. We also sell services, including miles for transportation, to non-airline partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies, and a major bank that offers Alaska Airlines affinity credit cards. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. For miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future. For services sold through one of our non-airline partners, the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered, and the remaining components are recorded as commission in other-net revenue in the period the services are performed. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $261 million , $213 million and $143 million , respectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines or expire, and as other-net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2014 , we had approximately 146 billion miles outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $730 million . Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in these estimates; therefore, different assumptions could affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or Mileage Plan expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold through non-airline partners: We defer sales proceeds under two accounting methodologies: the relative selling price method, which represents approximately 94% of sold miles, and the residual accounting method, which represents the remaining 6%. For contracts that were modified after the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force" (ASU 2009-13), we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed. We estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables. This relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables. A 1% shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately $4 million. For remaining contracts that continue to be accounted for under the residual method, as our estimates of selling price change, the amount we defer changes, resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds to commission revenue in any given period. A 10% increase in the estimated selling price of travel (and related deferral rate) would decrease commission revenue by approximately $2 million in the period cash is received. This amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place. 47 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) considers historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. Based on statistical analysis of historical data, our current breakage rate is 17.4%. A hypothetical 1% change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a $6 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award: We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical award redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners, and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel: When a frequent flier travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. PENSION PLANS Accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity defined-benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements and requires recognition of the changes in funded status in other comprehensive income. Pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements. We recognized expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans of $9 million , $50 million , and $57 million in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. We expect the 2015 expense to be approximately $28 million , as a result of a lower discount rate, a lower expected return on assets, and an increase in estimated participant longevity assumptions. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate increases. We discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 4.20% and 4.85% at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The discount rate was determined using current rates earned on high-quality, long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans. At December 31, 2014 , we refined the yield curve to use a pool of higher-yielding bonds estimated to be more reflective of settlement rates, as we are taking steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future. If the discount rate decreased by 0.5% (from 4.20% to 3.70% ), our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2014 would increase by approximately $152 million and our estimated 2015 pension expense would increase by approximately $10 million . 48 Pension liability and future pension expense can increase or decrease as assumptions in the actuarial data changes. In December 31, 2014 , new mortality tables became available using more recent participant data. The new tables are intended to update and replace the RP-2000 tables that have been used in actuarial valuations since 2000. We have elected to apply proprietary mortality tables provided by a third party actuary which is segregated into industry-specific mortality information and includes actual participant data from our plans. As expected, the tables reflect the longer expected lifespans of employees. Generally speaking, the new tables reflect an 11% - 12% longer life expectancy of people age 65 than the 2000 tables. The change in the assumption increased our projected benefit obligation by approximately $80 million at December 31, 2014 . Pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2014 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50% , which decreased 0.25% from the rate at December 31, 2013 . The decrease in rate is due to the shift of our pension asset portfolio into more fixed income investments that better match the cash flows of our expected benefit payments and reduce the volatility of future returns. We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2014 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities and U.S. fixed-income securities. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 0.5% (from 6.50% to 6.00% ) would increase our estimated 2015 pension expense by approximately $10 million . All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Additionally, benefits in our non-union defined-benefit plans were frozen January 1, 2014. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2014 , we had approximately $4.3 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft.
