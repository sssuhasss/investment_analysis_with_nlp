ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about anticipated market conditions, expected growth rates of revenues and expenses, planned asset dispositions, disposition pricing, planned acquisitions, developments and renovations, property financings, expected interest rates, joint venture activity and planned capital expenditures. Although Mid-America believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements 23 included in this report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Mid-America or any other person that the objectives and plans of Mid-America will be achieved. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon Mid-America consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires Mid-America to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, Mid-America evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Mid-America believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Mid-America believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most subjective judgments, form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Revenue recognition Mid-America leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rent and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned. Other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings, other expense reimbursements, and administrative, application and other fees charged to residents. Interest, management fees, and all other sources of income are recognized as earned. Mid-America records all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with Statement No. 66 Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets Mid-America carries real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and 3 to 5 years for computers and software, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by Mid-America in order to elevate the condition of the property to Mid-America standards are capitalized as incurred. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill Mid-America accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , or Statement 144, and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , or Statement 142. Mid-America evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in Mid-America fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. Mid-America periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors. In accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected 24 to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, Mid-America determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. Mid-America determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141, Business Combinations . The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments Mid-America utilizes certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with Mid-America variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. The valuation of the derivative financial instruments under Statement No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended, requires Mid-America to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While Mid-America calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by Mid-America before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated. Mid-America measures ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 Mid-America results for 2006 were positively influenced by both improved operating performance from communities held throughout both the current and prior period, or same store, and the positive impact from acquisitions in recent years. Strong economic growth and job formation enabled Mid-America to improve our same store occupancy and average rental rates from the prior year. Mid-America has grown externally during the past three years by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Mid-America acquired six properties in 2004 and three properties in 2005 for which it benefited from full years of revenues in 2006. Mid-America acquired an additional six properties during 2006. Mid-America experienced an increase in interest expense in 2006 as our total debt outstanding and average borrowing costs both increased from prior year levels. The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Mid-America for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 25 As of December 31, 2006, the total number of apartment units Mid-America owned or had an ownership interest in, including the properties owned by the joint venture was 40,293 in 138 communities compared to 38,227 apartment units in 132 communities owned at December 31, 2005, and 37,904 apartment units in 132 communities owned at December 31, 2004. For communities owned 100% by Mid-America, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $726 at December 31, 2006 from $695 at December 31, 2005, and $680 at December 31, 2004. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was 94.2%, 94.6%, and 93.6%, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2006, to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased by approximately $29,982,000 from the year ended December 31, 2005, due to (i) a $9,538,000 increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2006, or the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) a $5,312,000 increase in property revenues from the three properties acquired in 2005, or the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) a $15,132,000 increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by an average 3.1% increase in average rent per unit in 2006 over 2005. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased by approximately $10,653,000 from the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $4,438,000 from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $1,913,000 from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) $4,302,000 from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by an increase in property insurance reflecting the increase in premiums effective July 1, 2006. The same store property operating expense increase also reflects increased utility rates as Mid-America experienced an increase in electricity, natural gas and water and sewer prices. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $4,975,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $2,711,000 from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $1,183,000 from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) $4,101,000 from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $3,020,000 from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of six communities acquired by Mid-America in 2004. Property management expenses increased by approximately $1,206,000 from the year ended December 31, 2005, to the year ended December 31, 2006, partially due to increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance and increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1,532,000 over this same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to improved performance. Interest expense increased approximately $5,070,000 in 2006 from 2005 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2005 and the increase in Mid-America twelve-month average borrowing cost from 5.2% for 2005, to 5.5% for 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $3,034,000 from the sale of two communities owned by a joint venture of Mid-America. The sales of these communities resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to Mid-America of approximately $1,723,000 in 2005. Mid-America had no dispositions in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Mid-America recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $749,000 mainly related to insurance settlements from hurricane damage experienced at some of Mid-America communities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Mid-America recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds of approximately $84,000. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income increased by approximately $1,201,000 in 2006 over 2005. 26 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2005, to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by approximately $30,260,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, due to (i) a $12,871,000 increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2004, or the 2004 acquisitions, (ii) a $8,204,000 increase in property revenues from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) a $9,185,000 increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by approximately $11,314,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $5,410,000 from the 2004 acquisitions, (ii) $3,361,000 from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) $2,543,000 from the properties held throughout both periods. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $6,403,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $2,921,000 from the 2004 acquisitions, (ii) $2,084,000 from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) $4,596,000 from fixed asset additions at the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $3,198,000 from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of 13 communities acquired by Mid-America in 2003. Property management expenses increased by approximately $1,514,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, to the year ended December 31, 2005, partially due to increased personnel expenses and incentive compensation both related to property acquisitions. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1,114,000 over this same period. Property management expenses and general and administrative expenses for 2005 were both impacted by a cumulative charge to amortize four years of a ten year senior management incentive plan which Mid-America previously expected would expense from 2007 through 2011. Interest expense increased approximately $7,759,000 in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2004 and the increase in Mid-America twelve-month average borrowing cost from 5.1% for 2004, to 5.2% for 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $3,034,000 from the sale of two communities owned by a joint venture of Mid-America. The sales of these communities resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to Mid-America of approximately $1,723,000 in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Mid-America recorded a total of approximately $9,074,000 in gains from two community sales, of which approximately $3,249,000 represented Mid-America share of the gain from the sale of a community which was owned by a joint venture of Mid-America. In 2005 and 2004, Mid-America refinanced the debt on several communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. In 2005, this resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $409,000 due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties. In 2004, Mid-America recorded a gain of approximately $1,095,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt. For the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, Mid-America recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $749,000 mainly related to insurance settlements from hurricane damage experienced at some of Mid-America communities and $2,683,000 mainly related to insurance settlements from fires at some of Mid-America communities, respectively. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by approximately $5,454,000 in 2005 over 2004. Funds From Operations Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in operating partnership income, gain on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. 27 In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, Mid-America has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation. Mid-America policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Mid-America believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Mid-America operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. Mid-America believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Mid-America calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 (dollars and shares in thousands): Y ears ended December 3 1, 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 20,945 $ 19,744 $ 25,198 Depreciation of real estate assets 78,048 73,067 66,659 Net gain on insurance and other settlement proceeds (84 ) (749 ) (2,683 ) Gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities (3,034 ) (3,249 ) Net (gain) loss on insurance and other settlement proceeds of discontinued operations 25 (526 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of discontinued operations 160 637 1,324 Gain on sale of discontinued operations (5,825 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of unconsolidated entities 500 482 1,688 Preferred dividend distribution (13,962 ) (14,329 ) (14,825 ) Minority interest in operating partnership income 1,590 1,571 2,264 Funds from operations $ 87,197 $ 77,414 $ 70,025 Weighted average shares and units: Basic 25,979 24,025 22,981 Diluted 26,204 24,227 23,316 FFO increases for both 2006 over 2005 and 2005 over 2004 were principally the result of improved community operations from Mid-America same store portfolio and the addition of communities from the 2004 acquisitions, 2005 acquisitions and 2006 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. Trends In 2006, community performance showed the benefit of improving market conditions, which was strong throughout most of Mid-America markets. Areas that had been weak for several years, especially Atlanta, Dallas, and Austin, showed improved demand. Mid-America believes that the primary driver of demand by apartment residents is job formation, and this continued to show solid momentum in most of Mid-America larger metro areas. Some of the smaller and mid-size markets in which Mid-America operates, such as Jackson, MS, Jacksonville, FL, and Columbus, GA remained reasonably strong during the market downturn that preceded this period, and continued to show solid performance. At the same time, Mid-America has noticed that in some of our markets, supply pressures have been surprisingly muted, and we believe that several factors are at work. In some markets, especially in Florida, some apartment communities 28 have been taken off the rental market and converted to condominiums. Construction and development costs for new apartments also seem to have risen substantially for a variety of reasons, and this has made the economics of building apartments to compete with Mid-America communities less attractive. Rising interest rates have impacted developers costs, and this may also have reduced the amount of competition that we face from single-family homes. The cooling of housing markets may also have caused some first time home buyers to delay their purchases. Mid-America faces cost pressures from increasing operating expenses, especially insurance and real estate tax costs, as well as increasing prices on materials that we use in maintaining our apartments. Mid-America believes that the current conditions of improved demand, a reduced rate of increase in supply, and reduced competition from single family homes, while somewhat offset by rising expenses, will continue to contribute to better operating results in the near future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $1,900,000 to $101,326,000 for 2006 compared to $99,426,000 for 2005 mainly related to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2006. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $11,724,000 to $99,426,000 for 2005 compared to $87,702,000 for 2004 mainly related to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately $132,957,000 from $107,391,000 in 2005 to $240,348,000 in 2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $167,302,000 in 2004. The change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity. A total of approximately $194,970,000 was invested in 2006 to acquire properties, this compares to approximately $105,643,000 in 2005, and $155,088,000 in 2004. Mid-America began limited development activities in 2006 which used net cash of approximately $10,919,000 and expanded our renovation activities using net cash of approximately $6,077,000 in 2006 compared to only $426,000 in 2005 and none in 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities increased approximately $117,607,000 to $130,503,000 in 2006 from $12,896,000 in 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities was $79,938,000 in 2004. Cash provided from credit lines and notes payable increased approximately $29,449,000 from approximately $57,079,000 in 2005 to $86,528,000 in 2006. Cash provided from credit lines and notes payable was approximately $280,930,000 in 2004. Principal payments on notes payable increased to approximately $29,862,000 in 2006 from $10,921,000 in 2005. Principal payments on notes payable were approximately $152,046,000 in 2004. Mid-America had fewer refinancings in 2006 and 2005 than in 2004. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2006 to approximately $152,286,000 primarily due to Mid-America raising of funds through stock issuances through our direct stock purchase plan, a controlled equity plan and an overnight offering. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2005 from 2004 to approximately $38,759,000 mainly related to Mid-America use of our direct stock purchase plan. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2006, for the $1.2 billion of debt outstanding was 5.6% compared to 5.4% on $1.1 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2005. Mid-America utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages and secured credit facilities. Mid-America utilizes fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on Mid-America borrowings can be found in the schedule on page 31. At December 31, 2006, Mid-America had secured credit facilities relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie MAC, and a group of banks led by AmSouth Bank. Together, these credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2006, with an availability to borrow of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2006, Mid-America had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $992 million. Approximately 71% of Mid-America outstanding obligations at December 31, 2006, were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, which we call the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $1.0 billion, all of which was available to borrow at December 31, 2006. Various traunches of the facilities mature from 2010 through 2014. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate 29 borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate on the date of renewal, which has typically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.05% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62% to 0.795%. Each of Mid-America secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If Mid-America were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect Mid-America liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if Mid-America were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on Mid-America. On May 26, 2005, Mid-America gave the required one year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of its 8 5/8% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series G ) on May 26, 2006, for the total redemption price of $10 million. As a result, in accordance with Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity , Mid-America classified the Series G as a liability within notes payable as of May 26, 2005, on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. On May 26, 2006, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series G. As of December 31, 2006, Mid-America had interest rate swaps in effect totaling a notional amount of approximately $679 million. To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. Mid-America also had interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $42 million in effect as of December 31, 2006. 30 Summary details of the debt outstanding at December 31, 2006, follows in the table below: Outstanding Balance/ Average Average Average Notional Interest Rate Contract Line Limit Line Availability Amount Rate Maturity Maturity COMBINED DEBT Fixed Rate or Swapped Conventional $ 855,252,207 5.6 % 8/15/2011 8/15/2011 Tax Exempt 73,500,000 4.4 % 1/16/2012 1/16/2012 Subtotal Fixed Rate or Swapped 928,752,207 5.5 % 8/27/2011 8/27/2011 Variable Rate Conventional 214,716,008 5.9 % 2/25/2007 10/9/2012 Tax Exempt 10,855,004 4.7 % 1/15/2007 5/30/2020 Conventional - Capped 17,936,000 5.9 % 11/13/2009 11/13/2009 Tax Exempt - Capped 24,090,000 4.6 % 11/27/2009 11/27/2009 Subtotal Variable Rate 267,597,012 5.8 % 2/20/2007 3/31/2013 Total Combined Debt Outstanding $ 1,196,349,219 5.6 % 8/23/2010 1/4/2012 UNDERLYING DEBT Individual Property Mortgages/Bonds Conventional Fixed Rate $ 147,252,207 5.0 % 4/2/2015 4/2/2015 Tax Exempt Fixed Rate 12,170,000 5.2 % 12/1/2028 12/1/2028 Tax Exempt Variable Rate 4,760,004 4.7 % 1/15/2007 6/1/2028 FNMA Credit Facilities Tax Free Borrowings $ 91,515,000 $ 91,515,000 91,515,000 4.6 % 1/15/2007 3/1/2014 Conventional Borrowings Fixed Rate Borrowings 90,000,000 90,000,000 90,000,000 7.5 % 7/1/2009 7/1/2009 Variable Rate Borrowings 862,914,000 862,914,000 662,318,000 5.9 % 2/26/2007 5/1/2013 Subtotal FNMA Facilities 1,044,429,000 1,044,429,000 843,833,000 5.9 % 5/23/2007 1/4/2013 Freddie Mac Credit Facility 300,000,000 143,729,000 143,729,000 5.9 % 2/25/2007 6/16/2012 AmSouth Credit Facility 40,000,000 22,939,605 4,605,008 7.3 % 1/31/2007 5/24/2007 Regions Bank (formerly Union Planters before July 2004 merger) 40,000,000 6.4 % 2/28/2007 4/1/2009 Total Underlying Debt Outstanding $ 1,196,349,219 5.8 % 7/15/2008 4/18/2013 HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Interest Rate Swaps LIBOR indexed $ 618,000,000 5.5 % 1/3/2011 BMA indexed 61,330,000 4.2 % 9/10/2008 Total Interest Rate Swaps $ 679,330,000 5.4 % 10/18/2010 Interest Rate Caps LIBOR indexed $ 17,936,000 6.2 % 11/13/2009 BMA indexed 24,090,000 6.0 % 11/27/2009 Total Interest Rate Caps $ 42,026,000 6.1 % 11/21/2009 During 2006, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 1,340,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $77 million in proceeds. During 2005, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 784,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $32 million in proceeds. During 2004, Mid-America offered an average discount of 2.0% from August through December through our DRSPP. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, Mid-America issued approximately 392,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $15.1 million in proceeds. 31 In May 2006, Mid-America sold 1,150,000 shares of common stock through a public offering generating net proceeds of approximately $59.5 million. Mid-America also sold 194,000 shares of common stock in December 2006 through our continuous equity offering plan generating approximately $11.4 million in net proceeds. Mid-America believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations and annual refurbishment of our communities through our cash flow and credit facilities. Mid-America is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of FNMA, which provides credit enhancement for approximately $844 million of Mid-America debt. The interest rate market for FNMA DMBS, which in Mid-America experience is highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, is also an important component of Mid-America liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. In the event that the FNMA DMBS market becomes less efficient, or the credit of FNMA becomes impaired, Mid-America would seek alternative sources of debt financing. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Mid-America net cash provided by operating activities fell short of covering improvements to existing real estate assets (excluding renovations), distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $4.9 million. This compares to excess coverage in 2005 of approximately $2.7 million and a shortfall for 2004 of approximately $10.3 million. While Mid-America has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates, from time-to-time Mid-America may utilize additional borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary. Any significant deterioration in operations could result in Mid-America financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event Mid-America would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects Mid-America total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2006, (dollars in 000 s): Payments Due by P eriod Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 T hereafter Total Long-Term Debt (1) $ 9,132 $ 110,496 $ 106,830 $ 121,933 $ 217,076 $ 630,882 $ 1,196,349 Operating Lease 12 12 3 27 Total $ 9,144 $ 110,508 $ 106,833 $ 121,933 $ 217,076 $ 630,882 $ 1,196,376 ____________________ (1) Represents principal payments. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2006, and 2005, Mid-America did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Mid-America joint venture with Blackstone (terminated in 2003) was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development (while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in FFO from the sale), share repurchases, and other capital requirements. Mid-America two joint ventures with Crow Holdings (one terminated in 2005 and one in 2007) were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance Mid-America return on investment through the generation of fee income. In addition, Mid-America does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, Mid-America is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. Mid-America does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with Mid-America or our related parties other than what is disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14. Mid-America investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as Mid-America does not have a controlling interest. Insurance Management believes that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks. Mid-America renegotiated our insurance programs July 1, 2006, and because of the significant reduction in available insurance for windstorm events and resulting large 32 increase in cost, purchased property insurance with limits reduced from prior years. Mid-America self-insures the first $500,000 of individual property losses, and, if greater, the first 10% of property losses caused by named windstorms and earthquakes, with a limit per event of $40 million for windstorm and earthquake damage. According to Mid-America risk consultant, approximately 20% of Mid-America property value is located in Wind Tier 1 risk areas (predominately certain parts of Florida) and 12% in the New Madrid earthquake risk zone. Mid-America does not own any direct coastal frontage property. The largest loss event from windstorm damage (tornado) Mid-America has experienced was $3.9 million in 1999. Mid-America experienced combined total losses of $2.2 million from windstorms in 2004 and 2005, with the biggest loss ($1.1 million) from Hurricane Francis in 2004. Mid-America insurance program is subject to review by our principal lenders. Inflation Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable Mid-America to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to Mid-America of the adverse effects of inflation. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , or Interpretation 48. Interpretation 48 provides clarification concerning the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in an enterprise financial statement in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . Interpretation 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Mid-America does not believe the adoption of Interpretation 48 will have a material impact on Mid-America consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , or Statement 157. Statement 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Mid-America does not believe the adoption of Statement 157 will have a material impact on Mid-America consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
