Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY About the Company Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS, the Company or Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a worldwide pharmaceutical and related health care products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life by providing the highest quality pharmaceutical and related health care products. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals and related health care products. The Company has three reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Health Care. The Pharmaceuticals segment is made up of the global pharmaceutical and international consumer medicines business. The Nutritionals segment consists of Mead Johnson Nutritionals (Mead Johnson), primarily an infant formula and children nutritionals business. The Other Health Care segment consists of the ConvaTec, Medical Imaging and Consumer Medicines (U.S. and Canada) businesses. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Consumer Medicines business. The Nutritionals and Other Health Care segments are also collectively known as the Health Care Group. For additional information about these segments, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 17. Segment Information. Business Environment The Company conducts its business primarily within the pharmaceutical industry, which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect the Company sales of its products, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance of its manufacturing operations, and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in the health care industry, the Company must not only demonstrate its products offer medical benefits, but also cost advantages. Currently, most of the Company new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category. The Company manufactures branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of the Company leading challenges globally. In the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss of a product, the Company can lose a major portion of that product sales in a short period of time. For further discussion on product exclusivity, see Item 1. Business Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity. Both in the U.S. and internationally, the health care industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations that authorize prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on the Company sales. In the U.S., Congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could effect major changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the state level. Driven in part by budget concerns, Medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others. In addition, in December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) was enacted to provide outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the United States. The MMA became effective in January 2006. The Company cannot predict the potential impact that this legislation will have on its business; however it could have a negative impact on the Company U.S. pharmaceutical business as greater federal involvement and budget constraints may increase the likelihood of pricing pressures or controls in the future. In many markets outside the United States, the Company operates in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory regimes that can exert downward pressure on pricing. Pricing freedom is limited in the United Kingdom, for instance, by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products and more than two years can elapse before new medicines become available in some national markets. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the health care industry. MCOs seek to reduce health care expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long-term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of the Company strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in a MCO formulary and the Company has generally been successful in having its major products included. The Company believes that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices. 39 Pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become more important to the Company product portfolio, the Company may continue to make arrangements with third party manufacturers, and expects to make substantial investments to increase its internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. The Company has maintained a competitive position in the market and strives to uphold this position, which is dependent on its success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. Management continues to believe, as previously disclosed, that during the next few years, the aggregate impact, beyond current reserves, of these and other legal matters affecting the Company is reasonably likely to be material to the Company results of operations and cash flows, and may be material to its financial condition and liquidity. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy The Company continues to execute its strategy for long term growth and is currently on track to complete its strategic transition in 2006 and to attain a period of sustainable sales and earnings growth starting in 2007. This strategy consists of increasing investments behind growth drivers, focusing the Company research and development programs on products in the pharmaceutical pipeline in disease areas that address significant unmet medical needs, aligning sales and marketing emphasis on specialists and high value primary care prescribers, and implementing initiatives designed to achieve and maintain a more efficient cost base. The Company is in the process of transforming its pharmaceutical portfolio in favor of growth drivers and specialty products, which include PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, ABILIFY*, REYATAZ, ERBITUX* and BARACLUDE. U.S. net sales of these products accounted for 35% of the Company worldwide pharmaceutical net sales in 2005, compared to 29% in 2004, while worldwide net sales of these products accounted for 36% of the Company worldwide net sales in 2005 as compared to 29% in 2004. In December 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ORENCIA (abatacept) and it became commercially available in the U.S. in February 2006. ORENCIA is targeted initially at adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an inadequate response to certain currently available treatments. A marketing authorization application (MAA) has also been submitted for the product with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). In January 2006, a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) was filed with the FDA for the approval of a third-party manufacturing facility to support increased production capacity for ORENCIA. The sBLA is part of the Company plan to engage in third-party manufacturing arrangements to meet future commercial demand expected to be generated from the approval and commercialization of a variety of biologics. Also in December 2005, the Company completed the submission of its New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for dasatinib, a kinase inhibitor for the potential treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). On March 7, 2006, the NDA was accepted and granted priority review for accelerated approval. In January 2006, the Company submitted an MAA for dasatinib to the EMEA. In October 2005, an FDA Advisory Committee recommended EMSAM*, a transdermal patch treatment of adults with major despressive disorder, could be safely administered without dietary modifications at the 6mg./24 hour dose. On February 27, 2006, the FDA approved EMSAM* for use without dietary modifications at the lowest dose of 6mg./24 hour. In keeping with its strategy, the Company invested $2.7 billion in research and development, representing a 10% growth rate over 2004. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products, including milestone payments for in-licensing and development programs, was $2.5 billion, or 16.5% of Pharmaceutical sales in 2005 compared to $2.3 billion, or 14.7% of Pharmaceutical sales in 2004. Another major aspect of the Company strategy relates to how it does business, specifically in its marketing and sales approaches. Specialists are playing an even greater role in decisions related to patient treatment and care, particularly in the 10 critical disease areas where the Company is focusing its efforts. The Company has realigned its U.S. and European sales forces with a focus on specialists as well as with those primary care physicians who are involved in treating patients in these disease areas. As part of its strategy, the Company is re-examining its operating costs to achieve and maintain a more efficient cost base. At the end of 2005, the Company launched an initiative to identify and realize productivity savings. Through this initiative, the Company will re-examine its operating model to focus resources on high value priorities; simplify and streamline business processes, governance and decision making; and build the capabilities to sustain these cost reductions for the long term. The Company goal is to realize a minimum of $500 million in productivity savings in 2007, an incremental $100 million in 2008 and implement lasting changes that will make the Company more productive, efficient and effective. 40 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the Company results of continuing operations excludes the results related to the Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) business, which were previously presented as a separate segment, and has been segregated from continuing operations and reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations below. % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 Net Sales $ 19,207 $ 19,380 $ 18,653 (1 )% 4 % Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Minority Interest and Income Taxes $ 4,516 $ 4,418 $ 4,680 2 % (6 )% % of net sales 23.5 % 22.8 % 25.1 % Provision for income taxes $ 932 $ 1,519 $ 1,210 (39 )% 26 % Effective tax rate 20.6 % 34.4 % 25.8 % Earnings from Continuing Operations $ 2,992 $ 2,378 $ 3,097 26 % (23 )% % of net sales 15.6 % 12.3 % 16.6 % Net Sales Net sales from continuing operations for 2005 decreased 1% to $19.2 billion compared to 2004. U.S. net sales in 2005 decreased 1% to $10.5 billion compared to 2004, while international net sales of $8.7 billion remained relatively constant in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. In 2004, net sales from continuing operations increased 4% to $19.4 billion from $18.7 billion in 2003. U.S. net sales in 2004 remained relatively constant at $10.6 billion compared to 2003 and international net sales increased 10% to $8.8 billion in 2004, including a 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, from $8.0 billion in 2003. The composition of the change in sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2005 vs. 2004 (1)% (2)% 1% 2004 vs. 2003 4% 4% In general, the Company business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceuticals prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Business Segments under the Pharmaceuticals section below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of the Company pharmaceutical products. The Company operates in three reportable segments Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Health Care. In May 2005, the Company completed the sale of OTN, which was previously presented as a separate segment. As such, the results of operations for OTN are presented as part of the Company results from discontinued operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Accordingly, OTN results of operations in prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations to conform with current year presentations. The percent of the Company net sales by segment were as follows: Net Sales % Change (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 Pharmaceuticals $ 15,254 $ 15,564 $ 15,025 (2 )% 4 % % of net sales 79 % 80 % 80 % Nutritionals 2,205 2,001 2,023 10 % (1 )% % of net sales 12 % 10 % 11 % Other Health Care 1,748 1,815 1,605 (4 )% 13 % % of net sales 9 % 10 % 9 % Total $ 19,207 $ 19,380 $ 18,653 (1 )% 4 % 41 The Company recognizes revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments: For the Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Gross Sales $ 23,003 $ 23,896 $ 22,992 Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Prime Vendor Charge-Backs (1,090 ) (1,319 ) (1,228 ) Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates (843 ) (846 ) (854 ) Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (514 ) (660 ) (710 ) Medicaid Rebates (595 ) (673 ) (523 ) Cash Discounts (271 ) (311 ) (319 ) Sales Returns (164 ) (276 ) (348 ) Other Adjustments (319 ) (431 ) (357 ) Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (3,796 ) (4,516 ) (4,339 ) Net Sales $ 19,207 $ 19,380 $ 18,653 The decrease in prime vendor charge-backs and managed health care rebates in 2005 was primarily due to lower relative sales volume in this segment due to product mix. The decrease in sales returns was primarily due to lower returns for certain products including TEQUIN, PRAVACHOL and SUSTIVA. The decrease in other adjustments was due to lower sales discounts and government rebates in the international businesses. In 2004, the increases from 2003 for prime vendor charge-backs and Medicaid rebates were primarily due to a shift in sales to products with higher discounts in prime vendor and Medicaid programs while the decrease in sales returns was primarily attributable to higher sales returns in 2003 resulting from discontinued products and product conversions. The following table sets forth the activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments: (Dollars in Millions) Prime Vendor Charge- Backs Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates Managed Health Care Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Cash Discounts Sales Returns Other Adjustments Total Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 101 $ 208 $ 249 $ 233 $ 30 $ 268 $ 124 $ 1,213 Provision related to sales made in current period 1,314 843 646 618 311 270 463 4,465 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 5 3 14 55 6 (32 ) 51 Returns and payments (1,314 ) (820 ) (711 ) (534 ) (308 ) (316 ) (385 ) (4,388 ) Impact of foreign currency translation 1 6 7 Balance at December 31, 2004 106 234 198 372 33 229 176 1,348 Provision related to sales made in current period 1,096 843 509 558 269 191 351 3,817 Provision related to sales made in prior periods (6 ) 5 37 2 (27 ) (32 ) (21 ) Returns and payments (1,089 ) (825 ) (542 ) (641 ) (278 ) (206 ) (364 ) (3,945 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (3 ) (2 ) (7 ) (12 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 107 $ 252 $ 167 $ 326 $ 26 $ 185 $ 124 $ 1,187 In 2005, the Company recorded gross-to-net sales adjusting charges and credits related to sales made in prior periods. The significant items included charges of $37 million for Medicaid rebates primarily as a result of higher than expected Medicaid utilization of various products; credits of $32 million for other adjustments primarily as a result of lower than expected rebates to foreign governments; and credits of $27 million for sales returns resulting from lower returns for certain products including TEQUIN, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and PLAVIX*. In 2004, the Company recorded charges of $55 million for Medicaid rebates related to sales made in prior periods. These charges include $34 million for rebate claims from prior years by certain states, primarily in relation to Medicaid utilization of oncology products not previously reported to the Company, and other revisions resulting from the availability of additional information. In addition, the Company recorded $32 million for other adjustments as a result of lower than expected rebates to foreign governments. 42 No other significant revisions were made to the estimates for gross-to-net sales adjustments in 2005 and 2004. Pharmaceuticals The composition of the change in pharmaceutical sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2005 vs. 2004 (2)% (3)% 1% 2004 vs. 2003 4% 1% (1)% 4% In 2005, Worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales decreased 2% to $15,254 million. U.S. pharmaceutical sales in 2005 decreased 3% to $8,190 million compared to $8,446 million in 2004, primarily due to the continued impact of exclusivity losses of PARAPLATIN and the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise and increased competition for PRAVACHOL, partially offset by increased sales of growth drivers including PLAVIX*, ABILIFY*, ERBITUX* and REYATAZ. In aggregate, estimated wholesaler inventory levels of the Company key pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceutical business at the end of 2005 were down from the end of 2004 by approximately three-tenths of a month to approximately two and a half weeks. The decline in inventory levels negatively impacted the sales performance of certain products in 2005. International pharmaceutical sales in 2005 decreased 1%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact to $7,064 million, primarily due to increased generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel), partially offset by increased sales of newer products including REYATAZ and ABLILFY*, as well as growth of PLAVIX*. In 2004, Worldwide Pharmaceuticals sales increased 4% to $15,564 million. U.S. pharmaceutical sales in 2004 remained constant at $8,446 million compared to $8,431 million in 2003. U.S. sales were negatively affected by increased competition for PRAVACHOL and exclusivity losses of PARAPLATIN and the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise, offset by increased sales of PLAVIX* and newer products, including ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and ERBITUX*. International pharmaceutical sales in 2004 increased 8% to $7,118 million, including a 9% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to generic competition for PRAVACHOL and TAXOL (paclitaxel), partially offset by the launches of ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and continued growth in PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*. Key pharmaceutical products and their sales, representing 80%, 80% and 78% of total pharmaceutical sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 % Change 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 Cardiovascular PLAVIX* $ 3,823 $ 3,327 $ 2,467 15 % 35 % PRAVACHOL 2,256 2,635 2,827 (14 )% (7 )% AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 982 930 757 6 % 23 % COUMADIN 212 255 303 (17 )% (16 )% MONOPRIL 208 274 470 (24 )% (42 )% Virology REYATAZ 696 414 88 68 % ** SUSTIVA 680 621 544 10 % 14 % ZERIT 216 272 354 (21 )% (23 )% VIDEX/VIDEX EC 174 274 267 (36 )% 3 % BARACLUDE 12 Other Infectious Diseases CEFZIL 259 270 327 (4 )% (17 )% Oncology TAXOL (paclitaxel) 747 991 934 (25 )% 6 % ERBITUX* 413 261 58 % PARAPLATIN 157 673 905 (77 )% (26 )% Affective (Psychiatric) Disorders ABILIFY* (total revenue) 912 593 283 54 % 110 % Metabolics GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise 172 336 948 (49 )% (65 )% Other Pharmaceuticals EFFERALGAN 283 274 244 3 % 12 % ** Change is in excess of 200% 43 Sales of PLAVIX*, a platelet aggregation inhibitor sold by the Company primarily in the U.S., increased 15%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $3,823 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to prescription growth of approximately 13% in the U.S. market. The rate of growth in 2005 reflects a deceleration in the growth rate of PLAVIX* sales, compared to a growth rate of 35%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to prescription growth of 24% in the U.S. in 2004. The Company is seeking to enhance the growth rate through several measures, including an expansion of a related direct to consumer (DTC) campaign, and the recently-filed sNDA for the results from the COMMIT and CLARITY trials, although there can be no assurance that those efforts will be successful. Sales in 2004 were $3,327 million and sales were $2,467 million in 2003. PLAVIX* is a cardiovascular product that was launched from the alliance between the Company and Sanofi-Aventis (Sanofi). Market exclusivity for PLAVIX* is expected to expire in 2011 in the U.S. and 2013 in the European Union (EU). Statements on exclusivity are subject to any adverse determination that may occur with respect to the PLAVIX* patent litigation. For additional information on the PLAVIX* patent litigation, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Sales of PRAVACHOL, an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, decreased 14% to $2,256 million in 2005 from 2004. U.S. sales decreased 10% to $1,274 million in 2005, primarily due to lower demand resulting from increased competition and the related reduction in wholesaler inventory levels, partially offset by lower managed health care rebates in 2005. Estimated U.S. prescriptions declined by approximately 17% compared to 2004. International sales decreased 19%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $982 million, reflecting generic competition in key European markets. In 2004, sales for PRAVACHOL decreased 7%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $2,635 million from $2,827 million in 2003, primarily due to a decrease in U.S. prescription demand of approximately 10% and exclusivity loss in select European markets, including Germany and the UK. The Company entered into a distribution agreement with Watson Pharmaceutical (Watson) authorizing Watson to distribute pravastatin sodium tablets in the U.S. Market exclusivity protection for PRAVACHOL is expected to expire on April 20, 2006 in the U.S. Market exclusivity in the EU expired in 2004, with the exception of France and Sweden, for which expiration will occur in August and March 2006, respectively, and in Italy, where expiration will occur in January 2008. Sales of AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, also part of the Sanofi alliance, increased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $982 million in 2005 from 2004. U.S. sales increased 2% to $574 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to increased demand, partially offset by a reduction in wholesaler inventory levels in 2005. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased approximately 11% compared to 2004. International sales increased 11%, including a 3% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $408 million from $368 million in 2004, primarily due to increased sales in Canada, France and Germany. In 2004, sales increased 23%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $930 million from $757 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales in Europe and strong U.S. prescription growth of approximately 15%. U.S. sales increased 19% to $562 million in 2004 compared to $474 million in 2003, while international sales increased 30%, including a 12% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $368 million from $283 million in 2003. Market exclusivity for AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) is expected to expire in 2011 in the U.S. and in 2012 in countries in the EU; AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* is not currently marketed in Japan. Sales of COUMADIN, an oral anti-coagulant used predominantly in patients with atrial fibrillation or deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, decreased 17% to $212 million in 2005 compared to 2004 sales, due to continued competition. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 19% compared to 2004. Sales in 2004 decreased 16% to $255 million from $303 million in 2003, due to increased generic competition. Market exclusivity for COUMADIN expired in the U.S. in 1997. Sales of MONOPRIL, a second generation angiotesin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension, decreased 24%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $208 million in 2005 due to increased generic competition in key European markets. Sales in 2004 were $274 million, a decrease of 42%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, from $470 million in 2003, due to the impact of market exclusivity loss. Market exclusivity protection for MONOPRIL expired in 2003 in the U.S. and has expired or is expected to expire between 2001 and 2008 in countries in the EU. MONOPRIL is not currently marketed in Japan. Sales of REYATAZ, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which was launched in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2003 and in Europe in the second quarter of 2004, increased 68% to $696 million in 2005, primarily due to increased demand. European sales increased 174% to $203 million in 2005 from $74 million in 2004. REYATAZ has achieved an estimated monthly new prescription share of the U.S. protease inhibitors market of approximately 28%. Sales in 2004 were $414 million compared to $88 million in 2003. Market exclusivity for REYATAZ is expected to expire in 2017 in the U.S., in countries in the EU and Japan. Sales of SUSTIVA, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, increased 10% to $680 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to estimated total U.S. prescription growth of approximately 5%, higher average selling prices and lower sales returns. In 2004, SUSTIVA sales increased 14%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange 44 impact, to $621 million from $544 million in 2003, primarily due to increased demand in 2004 and higher prices. Market exclusivity protection for SUSTIVA is expected to expire in 2013 in the U.S. and in countries in the EU; the Company does not, but others do, market SUSTIVA in Japan. Sales of ZERIT, an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV, decreased 21%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $216 million in 2005, primarily as a result of a decrease in estimated total U.S. prescriptions of approximately 31% compared to 2004. In 2004, ZERIT sales decreased 23%, including a 4% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $272 million from $354 million in 2003, primarily as a result of continued decrease in demand due to potential adverse side effects. Market exclusivity protection for ZERIT is expected to expire in 2008 in the U.S., between 2007 and 2011 in countries in the EU and in 2008 in Japan. Sales of VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of HIV, decreased 36% to $174 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to generic competition in the U.S., which began in the fourth quarter of 2004. In 2004, VIDEX/VIDEX EC sales increased 3%, including a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $274 million in 2004 from $267 million in 2003 due to increased sales in Europe, partially offset by sale declines in the U.S. The Company has a licensing arrangement with the U.S. Government for VIDEX/VIDEX EC, which by its terms became non-exclusive in 2001. The U.S. Government intellectual property protection expires in 2007 in the U.S. (which includes an earned pediatric extension) and in Japan, and between 2006 and 2009 in countries in the EU. The license to the Company is non-exclusive, which has allowed another company to obtain a license from the U.S. Government and receive approval for marketing. With respect to VIDEX/VIDEX EC, the Company has patents covering the reduced mass formulation of VIDEX/VIDEX EC that expire in 2012 in the U.S., the EU and Japan. However, these patents apply only to the type of reduced mass formulation specified in the patent. Other reduced mass formulations may exist. There is currently no issued patent covering the VIDEX EC formulation. BARACLUDE, the Company internally developed oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, was approved by the FDA in March 2005, and generated sales of $12 million primarily in the U.S. since its U.S. launch in April 2005. BARACLUDE received approvals from international authorities including China, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia and Argentina during the second half of 2005. The Company believes that the primary markets for BARACLUDE will be outside the U.S. The Company has a composition of matter patent that expires in the U.S. in 2010. Sales of CEFZIL, an antibiotic for the treatment of mild to moderately severe bacterial infections, decreased 4%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $259 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to lower demand. In 2004, CEFZIL sales decreased 17%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $270 million from $327 million in 2003, primarily due to decreased demand in the U.S., partially offset by higher international sales. Market exclusivity expired in December 2005 in the U.S. and is expected to expire between 2007 and 2009 in the EU. Sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel), an anti-cancer agent sold almost exclusively in the non-U.S. markets, were $747 million in 2005 compared to $991 million in 2004. Sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel) decreased 25%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily as a result of increased generic competition in Europe. Generic competition for TAXOL (paclitaxel) in a majority of the major European markets began in the second quarter of 2004 and increased in the second half of 2004. In 2004, TAXOL (paclitaxel) sales increased 6%, including a 9% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $991 million from $934 million in 2003, primarily due to generic competition in Europe. Market exclusivity protection for TAXOL (paclitaxel) expired in 2002 in the U.S., in 2003 in the EU and is expected to expire between 2006 and 2013 in Japan. ERBITUX*, used to treat refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, was approved by the FDA in February 2004. Sales of ERBITUX*, which is sold almost exclusively in the U.S., increased 58% to $413 million in 2005 compared to $261 million in 2004. ERBITUX* is marketed by the Company under a distribution and copromotion agreement with ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone). A patent relating to combination therapy with ERBITUX* expires in 2017. The Company right to market ERBITUX* in North America and Japan expires in September 2018. The Company does not, but others do, market ERBITUX* in countries in the EU. Sales of PARAPLATIN, an anti-cancer agent, decreased 77% to $157 million in 2005 from 2004 due to generic competition in the U.S. that began in mid-2004 and increased with the entry of multiple generic competitors in the fourth quarter of 2004. U.S. sales of PARAPLATIN decreased 95% to $28 million in 2005 from 2004. In 2004, PARAPLATIN sales decreased 26%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $673 million from $905 million in 2003, primarily due to generic competition in the U.S. Market exclusivity protection for PARAPLATIN expired in October 2004 in the U.S., in 2000 in the EU and in 1998 in Japan. Total revenue for ABILIFY*, an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute bipolar mania and Bipolar Disorder, increased 54% to $912 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to demand growth in the U.S. and the continued 45 growth in Europe, which achieved sales of $140 million in 2005. Estimated U.S. prescription demand grew approximately 42% compared to 2004, partially offset by a reduction in wholesaler inventory levels in 2005. Sales growth in the future could be impacted by a trend involving an overall decrease in the rate of growth in demand for antipsychotic agents in the U.S. In 2004, total revenue for ABILIFY* was $593 million, compared to $283 million in 2003. Total revenue for ABILIFY* primarily consists of alliance revenue representing the Company 65% share of net sales in copromotion countries with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka). Otsuka market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2014 in the U.S. (including the granted patent term extension). The Company also has the right to copromote ABILIFY* in several European countries (the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain) and to act as exclusive distributor for the product in the rest of the EU. Market exclusivity protection for ABILIFY* is expected to expire in 2009 for the EU (and may be extended until 2014 if pending supplemental protection certificates are granted). The Company contractual right to market ABILIFY* expires in November 2012 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and, for the countries in the EU where the Company has the exclusive right to market ABILIFY* until June 2014. Statements on exclusivity are subject to any adverse determination that may occur with respect to the ABILIFY* patent reexamination. For additional information on this matter, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. For additional information on revenue recognition of ABILIFY*, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Sales for the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise decreased 49% to $172 million in 2005, compared to a 65% decrease to $336 million in 2004 from $948 million in 2003. The decrease in sales in both 2005 and 2004 primarily resulted from increased generic competition. Market exclusivity protection expired in March 2000 for GLUCOPHAGE* IR, in October 2003 for GLUCOPHAGE* XR and in January 2004 for GLUCOVANCE*. The Company does not, but others do, market these products in the EU and Japan. Sales of EFFERALGAN, a formulation of acetaminophen for pain relief, increased 3%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $283 million in 2005, primarily due to increased sales in Italy and Spain as a result of a strong flu season in 2005. In 2004, sales increased 12%, including a 12% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $274 million from $244 million in 2003. The estimated U.S. prescription and U.S. prescription growth data provided above includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and do not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The estimated prescription and prescription growth data are based on National Prescription Audit (NPA) data provided by IMS Health (IMS), a supplier of market research for the pharmaceutical industry, as described below. In most instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated above is the expiration date of the patent that claims the active ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication. In some instances, the basic exclusivity loss date indicated is the expiration date of the data exclusivity period. In situations where there is only data exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval prior to the expiration of the data exclusivity period by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval. The Company assesses the market exclusivity period for each of its products on a case-by-case basis. The length of market exclusivity for any of the Company products is difficult to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and other factors. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that the Company currently anticipates. The estimates of market exclusivities reported above are for business planning purposes only and are not intended to reflect the Company legal opinion regarding the strength or weakness of any particular patent or other legal position. For further discussion of market exclusivity protection, including a chart showing net sales of key products together with the year in which basic exclusivity loss occurred or is expected to occur in the U.S., the EU and Japan, see Item 1. Business Products and Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity. Estimated End-User Demand The following tables set forth for each of the Company top 15 pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business (based on 2004 annual net sales), for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 compared to the same periods in the prior year: (a) changes in reported U.S. net sales for the period; (b) estimated total U.S. prescription growth for the retail and mail order channels and the estimated U.S. therapeutic category share of the applicable product, calculated by the Company based on NPA data provided by IMS; and (c) estimated total U.S. prescription growth for the retail and mail order channels and the estimated U.S. therapeutic category share of the applicable product, calculated by the Company based on Next-Generation Prescription Services (NGPS) data provided by IMS. 46 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Month Ended December 31, 2005 % Change in U.S. Net Sales (a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions Estimated TRx Therapeutic Category Share % (e) NPA Data (b) NGPS Data (c) NPA Data (b) NGPS Data (c) ABILIFY* (total revenue) 35 42 40 11 11 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 2 11 12 15 15 CEFZIL (5 ) (10 ) (11 ) 2 2 COUMADIN (20 ) (19 ) (20 ) 21 20 DOVONEX* (7 ) (7 ) (8 ) 3 3 ERBITUX* (d) 58 N/A N/A N/A N/A GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise (52 ) (63 ) (62 ) 2 2 PARAPLATIN (d) (95 ) N/A N/A N/A N/A PLAVIX* 14 13 13 86 86 PRAVACHOL (10 ) (17 ) (16 ) 7 7 REYATAZ 33 39 37 31 31 SUSTIVA 11 5 8 24 23 TEQUIN (17 ) (30 ) (28 ) 1 1 VIDEX/VIDEX EC (73 ) (65 ) (65 ) 2 2 ZERIT (18 ) (31 ) (30 ) 7 6 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Month Ended December 31, 2004 % Change in U.S. Net Sales (a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions Estimated TRx Therapeutic Category Share % (e) NPA Data (b) NGPS Data (c) NPA Data (b) NGPS Data (c) ABILIFY* (total revenue) 98 103 103 9 9 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 19 15 18 15 15 CEFZIL (31 ) (30 ) (29 ) 2 2 COUMADIN (18 ) (17 ) (21 ) 27 27 DOVONEX* 11 (7 ) (6 ) 3 3 ERBITUX* (d) N/A N/A N/A N/A GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise (66 ) (60 ) (61 ) 3 3 PARAPLATIN (d) (30 ) N/A N/A N/A N/A PLAVIX* 36 24 27 85 85 PRAVACHOL (12 ) (10 ) (9 ) 9 9 REYATAZ ** ** ** 12 12 SUSTIVA 9 4 11 24 23 TEQUIN (27 ) (24 ) (23 ) 2 2 VIDEX/VIDEX EC (3 ) (4 ) 3 9 9 ZERIT (32 ) (29 ) (27 ) 9 9 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Month Ended December 31, 2003 % Change in U.S. Net Sales (a) % Change in U.S. Total Prescriptions Estimated TRx Therapeutic Category Share % (e) NPA Data (b) NGPS Data (c) NPA Data (b) NGPS Data (c) ABILIFY* (total revenue) ** ** *** 6 *** AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* 24 15 *** 15 *** CEFZIL 14 (4 ) *** 3 *** COUMADIN 1 (15 ) *** 33 *** DOVONEX* (5 ) *** 3 *** ERBITUX* (d) N/A N/A N/A N/A GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise 22 (16 ) *** 14 *** PARAPLATIN (d) 26 N/A N/A N/A N/A PLAVIX* 27 29 *** 82 *** PRAVACHOL 22 2 *** 12 *** REYATAZ *** 3 *** SUSTIVA 13 17 *** 11 *** TEQUIN 7 (21 ) *** 2 *** VIDEX/VIDEX EC (11 ) 3 *** 6 *** ZERIT (29 ) (25 ) *** 7 *** 47 (a) Reflects percentage change in net sales in dollar terms, including change in average selling prices and wholesaler buying patterns.

(d) ERBITUX* and PARAPLATIN specifically, and parenterally administered oncology products in general, do not have prescription-level data because physicians do not write prescriptions for these products. The Company believes therapeutic category share information provided by third parties for these products may not be reliable and accordingly, none is presented here. (e) The therapeutic categories are determined by the Company as those products considered to be in direct competition with the Company own products. The products listed above compete in the following therapeutic categories: ABILIFY* (antipsychotics), AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (angiotensin receptor blockers), CEFZIL (branded oral solid and liquid antibiotics), COUMADIN (warfarin), DOVONEX* (anti-inflamatory-antipsoriasis), GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise (oral antidiabetics), PLAVIX* (antiplatelet agents), PRAVACHOL (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), REYATAZ (protease inhibitors), SUSTIVA (antiretrovirals - third agents), TEQUIN (branded oral solid antibiotics), VIDEX/VIDEX EC (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) and ZERIT (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). ** In excess of 200%. *** Data for 2003 are not available, therefore this section is omitted. The Company has historically reported estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on NPA data, which IMS makes available to the public on a subscription basis, and a simple average of the estimated number of prescriptions in the retail and mail order channels. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company began disclosing estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on both NPA and NGPS data. NGPS data is collected by IMS under a new, revised methodology and has been released by IMS on a limited basis through a pilot program. IMS has publicly announced it expects to make NGPS data available to the public on a subscription basis in 2007. The Company believes that the NGPS data provided by IMS provides a superior estimate of prescription data for the Company products in the retail and mail order channels. The Company has calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on NGPS data on a weighted average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied compared with retail prescriptions. The Company believes that calculation of the estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on the NGPS data and the weighted average approach with respect to the retail and mail order channels provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand. The Company now uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. The estimated prescription growth data and estimated therapeutic category share provided above only include information from the retail and mail order channels and do not reflect information from other channels, such as hospitals, institutions and long-term care, among others. The data provided by IMS are a product of IMS own record-keeping processes and are themselves estimates based on sampling procedures, subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling. In addition, the NGPS data is part of a pilot program that is still being refined by IMS. The Company continuously seeks to improve the quality of its estimates of prescription growth amounts, therapeutic category share percentages and ultimate patient/consumer demand through review of its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and review and analysis of its own and third parties data used in such calculations. The Company expects that it will continue to review and refine its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze its own and third parties data used in such calculations. The following table sets forth for each of the Company key pharmaceutical products sold by the Company International Pharmaceuticals reporting segment, including the top 15 pharmaceutical products sold in the Company major non-U.S. countries (based on 2004 net sales), and for each of the key products sold by the other reporting segments listed below, the percentage change in the Company estimated ultimate patient/consumer demand for the month of December 2005 compared to the month of September 2005, the month of September 2005 compared to the month of June 2005, and the month of June 2005 compared to the month of March 2005. 48 % Change in Demand on a Constant U.S. Dollar Basis December 2005 vs. September 2005 September 2005 vs. June 2005 June 2005 vs. March 2005 International Pharmaceuticals ABILIFY* (total revenue) 19 1 50 AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* (13 ) 14 BUFFERIN* 24 2 (21 ) CAPOTEN (10 ) DAFALGAN 18 (4 ) (17 ) EFFERALGAN (2 ) 39 (43 ) MAXIPIME 8 (13 ) (15 ) MONOPRIL 4 (26 ) (2 ) PARAPLATIN (1 ) (4 ) 2 PERFALGAN 19 (13 ) 5 PLAVIX* 1 (1 ) 2 PRAVACHOL (4 ) (16 ) 7 REYATAZ 2 4 5 SUSTIVA (1 ) (1 ) (7 ) TAXOL (paclitaxel) (4 ) (4 ) (17 ) VIDEX/VIDEX EC 3 (14 ) 3 ZERIT (6 ) (21 ) (5 ) Nutritionals ENFAMIL 1 6 NUTRAMIGEN 1 (2 ) 5 Other Health Care ConvaTec Ostomy 7 7 Wound Therapeutics 4 (3 ) 14 Medical Imaging CARDIOLITE (7 ) (6 ) (5 ) Consumer Medicines EXCEDRIN* N/A N/A (13 ) Estimated Inventory Months on Hand in the Distribution Channel The following table sets forth for each of the Company top 15 pharmaceutical products sold by the Company U.S. Pharmaceuticals business (based on 2004 annual net sales), the U.S. Pharmaceuticals net sales of the applicable product for each of the six quarters ended September 30, 2004 through December 31, 2005, and the estimated number of months on hand of the applicable product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel as of the end of each of the six quarters.

At December 31, 2004, the estimated value of CEFZIL inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $1.6 million. Prescriptions for CEFZIL, an antibiotic, are typically higher in the winter months in the U.S. As a result, the Company U.S. wholesalers built higher inventories of the product in the fourth quarter of 2004 to meet that expected higher demand. At March 31, 2005, the Company had worked down U.S. wholesaler inventory levels of CEFZIL to less than one month on hand, and remained at less than one month on hand in subsequent quarters. At December 31, 2004, the estimated value of GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products inventory (GLUCOPHAGE* XR, GLUCOPHAGE* IR, GLUCOVANCE* and METAGLIP*) in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $1.6 million. As with all products, the months on hand estimate for the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products is an average of months on hand for all stock-keeping units (SKUs) of the product group. The increase in months on hand of the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products at the end of the fourth quarter of 2004 to above one month on hand resulted primarily from the purchase by wholesalers of certain SKUs. After giving effect to these purchases, the increased months on hand for these SKUs were less than one month on hand. However, when the increased months on hand for these SKUs were averaged with all SKUs for the GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products, the aggregate estimated months on hand exceeded one month. At March 31, 2005, the estimated value of GLUCOPHAGE* Franchise products inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel had been worked down to approximately one month on hand, and has been worked down to, and remained at, less than one month on hand in subsequent quarters. In October 2004, the U.S. pediatric exclusivity period for PARAPLATIN (carboplatin) expired. The resulting entry of multiple generic competitors for PARAPLATIN led to a significant decrease in demand for PARAPLATIN, which in turn led to the months on hand of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeding one month at September 30, 2004, December 31, 2004 and September 30, 2005. The estimated value of PARAPLATIN inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over one month on hand was approximately $6.6 million at September 30, 2004, $6.0 million at December 31, 2004 and $0.7 million at September 30, 2005. During this time, the Company continued to monitor PARAPLATIN sales with the intention of working down wholesaler inventory levels to less than one month on hand, and by December 31, 2005, the Company had worked down U.S. wholesaler inventory levels of PARAPLATIN to less than one month on hand. At March 31 and September 30, 2005, the estimated value of VIDEX/VIDEX EC inventory in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel exceeded one month on hand by approximately $1.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. As a result of generic competition in the U.S. commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, demand for VIDEX/VIDEX EC decreased significantly. During this time, the Company continued to monitor VIDEX/VIDEX EC sales with the intention of working down wholesaler inventory levels to less than one month on hand, and by December 31, 2005, the Company had worked down U.S. wholesaler inventory levels of VIDEX/VIDEX EC to less than one month on hand. For all products other than ERBITUX*, the Company determines the above months on hand estimates by dividing the estimated amount of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel by the estimated amount of out-movement of the product from the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over a period of 31 days, all calculated as described below. Factors that may influence the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, such estimates are calculated using third party data, which represent their own record-keeping processes and as such, may also reflect estimates. 50 The Company maintains inventory management agreements (IMAs) with most of its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers currently account for over 90% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. The inventory information received from these wholesalers excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals, and excludes goods in transit to such wholesalers. The Company uses the information provided by these three wholesalers as of the Friday closest to quarter end to calculate the amount of inventory on hand for these wholesalers at the applicable quarter end. This amount is then increased by the Company estimate of goods in transit to these wholesalers as of the applicable Friday, which have not been reflected in the weekly data provided by the wholesalers. Under the Company revenue recognition policy, sales are recorded when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, which in the U.S. Pharmaceutical business is generally when product is shipped. In such cases, goods in transit to a wholesaler are owned by the applicable wholesaler and, accordingly, are reflected in the calculation of inventories in the wholesaler distribution channel. The Company estimates the amount of goods in transit by using information provided by these wholesalers with respect to their open orders as of the applicable Friday and the Company records of sales to these wholesalers with respect to such open orders. The Company determines the out-movement of a product from these wholesalers over a period of 31 days by using the most recent four weeks of out-movement of a product as provided by these wholesalers and extrapolating such amount to a 31 day basis. The Company estimates inventory levels on hand and out-movements for its U.S. Pharmaceutical business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers for each product based on the assumption that such amounts bear the same relationship to the three largest wholesalers inventory levels and out-movements for such product as the percentage of aggregate sales for all products to these other wholesalers in the applicable quarter bears to aggregate sales for all products to the Company three largest wholesalers in such quarter. Finally, the Company considers whether any adjustments are necessary to these extrapolated amounts based on such factors as historical sales of individual products made to such other wholesalers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand. In addition, the Company receives inventory information from these other wholesalers on a selective basis for certain key products. The Company U.S. pharmaceuticals business, through the IMAs discussed above, has arrangements with substantially all of its direct wholesaler customers that allow the Company to monitor U.S. wholesaler inventory levels and require those wholesalers to maintain inventory levels at approximately one month or less of their demand. In the second and third quarters of 2005, the Company negotiated amendments to its IMAs with its three largest wholesalers. The amendments extended the original agreements through December 31, 2005 and established lower limits than the original agreements for inventory levels of Company pharmaceutical products held by the wholesalers. In December 2005, the Company reached two year IMAs in principle with its three largest U.S. wholesalers, which provide the same lower limits of wholesaler inventory levels as the IMA extensions previously negotiated. To help maintain the product quality of the Company biologic oncology product, ERBITUX*, the product is shipped only to end-users and not to other intermediaries (such as wholesalers) to hold for later sales. During 2004 and through May 2005, one of the Company wholesalers provided warehousing, packing and shipping services for ERBITUX*. Such wholesaler held ERBITUX* inventory on consignment and, under the Company revenue recognition policy, the Company recognized revenue when such inventory was shipped by the wholesaler to the end-user. The above estimates of months on hand for the three months ended March 31, 2005, were calculated by dividing the inventories of ERBITUX* held by the wholesaler for its own account as reported by the wholesaler as of the end of the quarter by the Company net sales for the last calendar month of the quarter. The inventory levels reported by the wholesaler are a product of the wholesaler own record-keeping process. Upon the divestiture of OTN in May 2005, the Company discontinued the consignment arrangement with the wholesaler and thereafter did not have ERBITUX* consignment inventory. Following the divestiture, the Company sells ERBITUX* to intermediaries (such as specialty oncology distributors) and ships ERBITUX* directly to the end users of the product who are the customers of those intermediaries. The Company recognizes revenue upon such shipment consistent with its revenue recognition policy. Accordingly, subsequent to June 30, 2005, there was no ERBITUX* inventory held by wholesalers. As previously disclosed, for the Company Pharmaceuticals business outside of the United States, Nutritionals and Other Health Care business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out movement information and the reliability of third party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. The following table, which was posted on the Company website and furnished on Form 8-K, sets forth for each of the Company key products sold by the reporting segments listed below, the net sales of the applicable product for each of the four quarters ended March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, and the estimated number of months on hand of the applicable product in the direct customer distribution channel for the reporting segment as of the end of each of the four quarters. The estimates of months 51 on hand for key products described below for the International Pharmaceuticals reporting segment are based on data collected for all of the Company significant business units outside of the United States. Also described further below is information on non-key product(s) where the amount of inventory on hand at direct customers is more than approximately one month and the impact is not de minimis. For the other reporting segments, estimates are based on data collected for the United States and all significant business units outside of the United States.

Expected demand is the estimated ultimate patient/consumer demand calculated based on estimated end-user consumption or direct customer out-movement data over the most recent 31 day period or other reasonable period. Factors that may affect the Company estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. The Company relies on a variety of methods to calculate months on hand for these reporting segments. Where available, the Company relies on information provided by third parties to determine estimates of aggregate product level inventory on hand at direct customers and expected demand. For the reporting segments listed above, however, the Company has limited information on direct customer product level inventory, end-user consumption and direct customer out-movement data. Further, the quality of third party information, where available, varies widely. In some circumstances, such as the case with new products or seasonal products, such historical end-user consumption or out-movement information may not be available or applicable. In such cases, the Company uses estimated prospective demand. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data do not exist or are otherwise not available, the Company has developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. As of December 31, 2005, September 30, 2005 and March 31, 2005, DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.2, 1.3 and 1.3 months of inventory on hand, respectively, at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand is due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing DAFALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product. As of September 30, 2005, EFFERALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand, at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand is due primarily to private pharmacists purchasing EFFERALGAN approximately once every eight weeks and the seasonality of the product. 53 As of December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, NUTRAMIGEN and PROSOBEE, infant nutritional products sold principally in the United States, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand at the end of December 2005 is due primarily to holiday stocking by retailers and at the end of September 2005 is due primarily to the impact of retailers holding higher levels of inventory in response to Hurricane Katrina. The Company plans to continue to monitor sales of NUTRAMIGEN and PROSOBEE with the intention of working down wholesaler inventory levels to less than one month on hand. As of June 30, 2005 and March 31, 2005, EXCEDRIN*, an analgesic product sold principally in the U.S., had approximately 1.5 months and 1.6 months, respectively, of inventory on hand at direct customers. The level of inventory on hand is due to the customary practice of direct customers holding within their warehouses and stores one and one-half to two months of product on hand. Inventory on hand and percentage change in demand data as of and for the month of September 30, 2005, respectively, is not available for EXCEDRIN*, which was included in the third quarter 2005 sale of the Company Consumer Medicines business. The Company continuously seeks to improve the quality of its estimates of months on hand of inventories held by its direct customers including thorough review of its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and review and analysis of its own and third parties data used in such calculations. The Company expects that it will continue to review and refine its methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze its own and third parties data in such calculations. The Company also has and will continue to take steps to expedite the receipt and processing of data for the non-U.S. Pharmaceuticals business. HEALTH CARE GROUP Nutritionals The composition of the change in Nutritional sales is as follows: Analysis of % Change Total Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2005 vs. 2004 10% 7% 2% 1% 2004 vs. 2003 (1)% (7)% 6% Key Nutritional product lines and their sales, representing 95%, 94% and 84% of total Nutritional sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 % Change 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 Infant Formulas $ 1,576 $ 1,405 $ 1,284 12 % 9 % ENFAMIL 992 859 808 15 % 6 % Toddler/Children Nutritionals 529 468 421 13 % 11 % Worldwide Nutritional sales increased 10%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact and a 2% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, to $2,205 million in 2005 from 2004. In 2004, Worldwide Nutritional sales were $2,001 million, a decrease of 1%, including a 10% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, from $2,023 million in 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, the Company divested its Adult Nutritional business. International sales increased 12%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact and a 1% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, to $1,135 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL, ENFAGROW and toddler and children nutritional products. In 2004, international sales increased 11%, including a 4% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, to $1,010 million from $910 million in 2003, primarily due to the increased sales of infant formula and children nutritional products. U.S. sales increased 8%, including a 3% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, to $1,070 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to increased sales of ENFAMIL. In 2004, U.S. sales decreased 11%, including a 14% unfavorable impact from the divestiture of the Adult Nutritional business, to $991 million from $1,113 million in 2003. Sales of ENFAMIL, the Company best-selling infant formula, increased 15%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $992 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to strong sales growth and the launch of ENFAMIL GENTLEASE LIPIL infant formula in August 2005. In 2004, ENFAMIL sales increased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $859 million from $808 million in 2003, primarily due to an increase in international sales. 54 Other Health Care The Other Health Care segment includes ConvaTec and the Medical Imaging business. The composition of the change in Other Health Care segment sales is as follows: Total Change Analysis of % Change Volume Price Foreign Exchange 2005 vs. 2004 (4)% (4)% (1)% 1% 2004 vs. 2003 13% 7% 1% 5% Other Health Care sales by business and their key products for the years ended December 31, were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2005 2004 2003 % Change 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 ConvaTec $ 992 $ 954 $ 843 4 % 13 % Ostomy 550 551 512 8 % Wound Therapeutics 416 391 319 6 % 23 % Medical Imaging 602 589 508 2 % 16 % CARDIOLITE 416 406 324 2 % 25 % Consumer Medicines 154 272 254 (43 )% 7 % Worldwide ConvaTec sales increased 4%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $992 million in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to the increase in worldwide sales of wound therapeutic products. Sales of wound therapeutic products increased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $416 million in 2005 from $391 million in 2004, primarily due to increased sales of AQUACEL. Ostomy sales remained constant at $550 million in 2005, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. In 2004, ConvaTec sales increased 13%, including an 8% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $954 million from $843 million in 2003, primarily due to a 23% increase in worldwide sales of wound therapeutic products. Worldwide Medical Imaging sales increased 2% to $602 million in 2005 from 2004. Sales of CARDIOLITE (Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi for Injection) increased 2% to $416 million in 2005 from $406 million in 2004, primarily due to increased demand. In 2004, Medical Imaging sales increased 16%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, to $589 million from $508 million, driven by increased sales of CARDIOLITE. This increase was partially due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition as a result of new distribution agreements entered into in January 2004. Geographic Areas In general, the Company products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the United States, France, Japan, Spain, Canada, Italy, Germany and Mexico. The Company sales by geographic areas were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) % Change 2005 2004 2003 2005 to 2004 2004 to 2003 United States $ 10,461 $ 10,613 $ 10,656 (1 )% % of Total 54 % 55 % 57 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 5,136 5,470 4,985 (6 )% 10 % % of Total 27 % 28 % 27 % Other Western Hemisphere 1,592 1,425 1,333 12 % 7 % % of Total 8 % 7 % 7 % Pacific 2,018 1,872 1,679 8 % 11 % % of Total 11 % 10 % 9 % Total $ 19,207 $ 19,380 $ 18,653 (1 )% 4 % Sales in the United States decreased 1% in 2005, as a result of lower sales of PARAPLATIN and the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise due to the continuing impact of earlier exclusivity losses, and PRAVACHOL, due to lower demand resulting from increased competition. This decrease in sales was mostly offset by increased sales of growth drivers including PLAVIX*, ABILIFY*, ERBITUX* and REYATAZ, and strong sales growth of ENFAMIL. In 2004, sales in the United States remained constant with growth in prescription demand for key brands including PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, and SUSTIVA, and newer products including ABILIFY*, REYATAZ, and ERBITUX*, offset by lower sales of other products as a result of exclusivity losses for MONOPRIL, PARAPLATIN, and the GLUCOPHAGE* franchise. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased 6%, including a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact, as a result of sales decline of TAXOL (paclitaxel), due to increased generic competition, and PRAVACHOL, due to exclusivity loss in select markets, including the UK and the Netherlands. This decrease in sales was partially offset by increased sales in major European markets of 55 REYATAZ and ABILIFY*, which were both launched in Europe in the second quarter of 2004. In 2004, sales increased 10%, including an 11% favorable foreign exchange impact, as a result of sales decline of PRAVACHOL, due to exclusivity loss in select markets, including Germany and the UK, and TAXOL (paclitaxel), where generic competition in a majority of the major European markets began in the second quarter of 2004. This decrease in sales was mostly offset by increased sales of PLAVIX* in Germany and Spain, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Italy and Spain, and SUSTIVA in the majority of the major markets. Sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 12%, including a 7% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada and Mexico, REYATAZ in Brazil and Canada, and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada. In 2004, sales increased 7%, including a 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Canada. Sales in the Pacific region increased 8%, as a result of increased sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel) in Japan, and ENFAGROW and ENFAMIL in China. In 2004, sales increased 11%, including a 5% favorable foreign exchange impact, as a result of increased sales of TAXOL (paclitaxel) and PARAPLATIN in Japan, and PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* in Australia.

In 2005, the unfavorable impact on gross margins resulting from the change in the U.S. pharmaceutical sales mix was offset by $76 million of net litigation charges recorded in 2004. In 2004, the increase over 2003 was due to the unfavorable impact of U.S. pharmaceutical sales mix due to the impact of generic competition in the U.S. for the GLUCHOPHAGE* franchise and PARAPLATIN, and the launch of lower margin ERBITUX*, partially offset by sales growth of ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and PLAVIX*. Gross margins in 2004 were also negatively impacted by $76 million of net litigation charges and higher accelerated depreciation charges compared with 2003. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 26.6% in 2005, 25.9% in 2004, and 24.7% in 2003. In 2005, marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2% to $5,106 million from 2004, primarily due to higher legal costs and higher pension expenses, reflecting increased amortization of unrecognized net losses as well as change in actuarial assumptions, partially offset by lower sales force expenses resulting from a focus on specialists and high value primary care physicians. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 9% to $5,016 million in 2004 from $4,620 million in 2003, primarily due to increased sales and marketing support for newer products, including additional sales representatives supporting ABILIFY*. In addition, the increase was also related to costs associated with the compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and unfavorable foreign exchange driven by the strengthening of the euro. 56 Advertising and product promotion expenditures increased 5% to $1,476 million as compared to 2004, primarily due to increased investments in direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for PLAVIX* and ABILIFY*, increased costs associated with pre-launch activities for ORENCIA and the launch of BARACLUDE, partially offset by lower spending on mature products. In 2004, advertising and promotion expenses remained relatively constant at $1,411 million as compared to $1,415 million in 2003, with increased investments in ABILIFY*, REYATAZ and PLAVIX* offset by lower spending on in-line and non-exclusive products. The Company investment in research and development totaled $2,746 million in 2005, an increase of 10% over 2004 and an increase in 2004 of 10% over 2003. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 14.3% in 2005 compared with 12.9% in 2004 and 12.2% in 2003. In 2005, the increase in research and development expenses reflects continued investments in late-stage compounds. Research and development costs also included $72 million of charges primarily related to milestone payments for licensing agreements in 2005, $58 million of charges consisting primarily of upfront and milestone payments in 2004 and $102 million of charges related to the upfront payments for licensing agreements in 2003. In 2005, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased to 16.5% of Pharmaceuticals sales compared with 14.7% in 2004 and 14.0% in 2003. Acquired in-process research and development of $63 million in 2004 was related to the purchase of Acordis, a UK-based company that is expected to strengthen the Company leadership position in wound therapeutics. For additional information on the acquisition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Restructuring programs have been implemented to downsize, realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses and to rationalize the Company manufacturing network, research facilities, and the sales and marketing organizations. Actions under the 2005 restructuring program are expected to be complete by 2006 while actions under the 2004 and 2003 restructuring programs were substantially completed at December 31, 2005. As a result of these actions, the Company expects the future annual benefit to earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes to be approximately $77 million, $186 million and $64 million for the 2005, 2004 and 2003 programs, respectively. For additional information on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 3. Restructuring. Litigation charges, net of settlement income, were $269 million in 2005, compared to $420 million in 2004 and $199 million in 2003. The $269 million charge in 2005 consisted of increases to the reserves of $590 million for liabilities primarily related to private litigations and governmental investigations and partially offset by insurance recoveries of $321 million. The $420 million in 2004 consisted of $336 million related to private litigation and governmental investigations related to wholesaler inventory issues and accounting matters, $50 million related to the PLATINOL litigation settlement and $34 million related to pharmaceutical pricing and sales practices. In 2003, the Company established reserves for liabilities in the total amount of $250 million, comprised of $150 million in relation to wholesaler inventory issues and certain other accounting matters, and $100 million in relation to pharmaceutical pricing and sales and marketing practices. In addition, the Company recorded charges of $31 million for other litigation matters and recognized income of $82 million. The $82 million of income consists primarily of $30 million of income for patent defense cost reimbursement, $27 million in litigation settlement income and $21 million from the settlement of anti-trust litigation involving vitamin manufacturers. For additional information on litigation, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. The gain on sale of business of $569 million ($370 million net of tax) in 2005 was related to the sale of the U.S. and Canadian Consumer Medicines business and related assets. The gain on sale of business of $320 million ($198 million net of tax) in 2004 was related to the sale of the Adult Nutritional business. For additional information on these transactions, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. Equity in net income of affiliates for 2005 was $334 million, compared with $273 million and $151 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Equity in net income of affiliates is principally related to the Company joint venture with Sanofi and investment in ImClone. In 2005, the $61 million increase in equity in net income of affiliates from 2004 primarily reflects an increase in net income in the Sanofi joint venture, partially offset by a net loss from the investment in ImClone. The $122 million increase in 2004 from 2003 primarily reflects an increase in net income in the Sanofi joint venture. For additional information on equity in net income of affiliates, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Other expenses, net of income, were $37 million, $52 million and $179 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other expenses include net interest expense, foreign exchange gains and losses, income from third-party contract manufacturing, royalty income and expense, deferred income and debt retirement costs. The $15 million decrease in other expenses in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to deferred income recognized from the termination of the collaborative agreement for muraglitazar, partially offset by debt retirement costs in connection with the repurchase of the $2.5 billion Notes due 2006 and higher net foreign exchange losses. The favorability in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher income from third-party contract manufacturing, lower net interest expense and lower net foreign exchange losses. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Other Expense, Net. 57 During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded several (income)/expense items that affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein, which are set forth in the following table.

The increase was primarily a result of growth in the Nutritionals segment and the net impact of items that affected the comparability of results as discussed above, partially offset by lower sales and gross margin of pharmaceutical products, primarily due to exclusivity losses and increased spending on research and development, primarily for late-stage pharmaceutical compounds. In 2004, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased 6% to $4,418 million from $4,680 million in 2003. Contributing to the decrease in 2004 were increases in costs of products sold as a result of a change in product mix, products losing exclusivity, increased investment in research and development, and the net impact of items that affected the comparability of results as discussed above, partially offset by growth in the Other Health Care segment and higher international sales. Pharmaceuticals Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in 2005 were $3,698 million. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to lower sales and gross margin, primarily due to exclusivity losses, higher advertising and product promotion investments behind growth drivers and increased spending on research and development. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $4,301 million in 2004 decreased from $4,414 million in 2003 primarily driven by gross margin erosion due to generic competition and product mix, additional sales representatives supporting ABILIFY*, increased spending on research and development, higher non-clinical grants and litigation settlement income in 2003, partially offset by higher sales. HEALTH CARE GROUP Nutritionals Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in 2005 were $648 million. The increase in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to increased worldwide sales of infant formula products and international sales of toddler and children nutritional products, partially offset by increased investments in advertising and product promotion, and research and development programs. Earnings 59 before minority interest and income taxes increased to $586 million in 2004 from $542 million in 2003, primarily due to increased global infant formula sales, a price increase in the infant formula line, favorable manufacturing variances and tight operating expense management. Other Health Care Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in 2005 were $492 million. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to the sale of the U.S. and Canadian Consumer Medicines business and related assets in the third quarter of 2005 and higher spending on research and development, partially offset by sales growth in the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Other Health Care segment increased to $529 million in 2004 from $363 million in 2003, primarily due to sales growth in the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses, in addition to favorable pricing and product mix. Corporate/Other Earnings/(loss) before minority interest and income taxes in 2005 were a loss of $322 million. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to the increase on the gain on the sales of businesses/product lines, deferred income recognized from the termination of the collaborative agreement for muraglitazar and a reduction of litigation charges, net. Earnings/(loss) before minority interest and income taxes increased to $998 million in 2004 from $639 million in 2003, primarily due to an increase in litigation charges, net; unfavorable foreign exchange driven by the strengthening of the euro; higher pension expenses, reflecting increased amortization of unrecognized net losses as well change in actuarial assumptions; an increase in downsizing and streamlining of worldwide operations; and an acquired in-process research and development charge in 2004. These increases were partially offset by the increase on the gain on the sale of businesses/product lines. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 20.6% in 2005 compared with 34.4% in 2004 and 25.8% in 2003. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 is due primarily to a 2004 charge of approximately $575 million for estimated deferred income taxes related to the repatriation of approximately $9 billion in special dividends from the Company non-U.S. subsidiaries pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), a 2004 charge related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain charitable contributions, a tax benefit in 2005 associated with the release of certain tax contingency reserves resulting from the settlement of examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 1998 through 2001, and a change in estimate in 2005 related to the reduction of the aforementioned 2004 AJCA deferred income tax charge, partially offset by lower estimated foreign tax credits in 2005. The increase in the 2004 effective tax rate over the 2003 effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the aforementioned 2004 AJCA deferred tax charge of $575 million, the aforementioned establishment of a valuation allowance against certain charitable contributions in 2004, an increase in estimates for contingent tax matters, partially offset by the favorable resolution of certain tax refund claims, increased foreign tax credits, and in 2003, the effect of certain litigation reserves as non-deductible. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company disclosed that it anticipated repatriating approximately $9 billion in special dividends in 2005 and recorded a $575 million provision for deferred income taxes pursuant to the AJCA as enacted and other pending matters. The Company repatriated approximately $6.2 billion from foreign subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2005 and repatriated the remaining balance of approximately $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company expects that approximately all of the $9 billion repatriated in 2005 will qualify as special dividends subject to finalization of its 2005 U.S. federal income tax return and any related tax examinations by the IRS. The Company has used and expects to continue to use the special dividends in accordance with requirements established by the AJCA and the U.S. Treasury Department. During the second quarter of 2005, the U.S. Treasury Department issued AJCA related guidance clarifying that the gross-up for foreign taxes associated with the special dividends also qualifies for the 5.25% tax rate established by the AJCA. As a result of this guidance, the Company reduced the $575 million provision by recording a benefit of approximately $135 million in its tax provision for 2005. Except for earnings associated with the special dividends discussed above, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on the balance of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since the Company has invested or expects to invest such earnings permanently offshore. The Company has recorded significant deferred tax assets related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $975 million and U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $120 million, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012. Realization of the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company anticipates increasing its level of domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the Company effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Company ability to utilize its foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards. The amount of foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the outcome of the PLAVIX* litigation in the U.S. is unfavorable, and/or if the timing of generic competition for PLAVIX* were to be accelerated. If such events occur, the Company may need to record significant additional valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. For additional information on PLAVIX* litigation, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Discontinued Operations In May 2005, the Company completed the sale of OTN to One Equity Partners LLC for cash proceeds of $197 million, including the impact of a preliminary working capital adjustment. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $63 million ($13 million net of tax) that was presented as a gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings. OTN was previously presented as a separate segment. For further discussions of OTN, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 5. Discontinued Operations. 60 The following amounts related to the OTN business have been segregated from continuing operations and are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented: (Dollars in Millions) Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 1,015 $ 2,506 $ 2,241 (Loss)/earnings before income taxes (8 ) 15 14 Net (loss)/earnings from discontinued operations (5 ) 10 9 Developments On March 1, 2006, the FDA approved ERBITUX* for use in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. As a result of the FDA approval, the Company will pay a $250 million milestone payment to ImClone by March 31, 2006. On February 27, 2006, the FDA approved EMSAM*, a transdermal patch treatment of adults with major depressive disorder, for use without dietary modifications at the lowest dose of 6mg./24 hour. In January 2006, the FDA accepted for review a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for PLAVIX* for treatment of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The FDA has designated the filing for priority review. Sanofi-Aventis and the Company have also submitted a filing to the EMEA for a STEMI indication in the European Union. In January 2006, the Company and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) announced they have obtained data supporting bioequivalence of a new formulation of the fixed-dose combination of the Company SUSTIVA and Gilead TRUVADA* (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with the components that make up the new combination. The new fixed-dose regimen is intended for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. Gilead and the Company anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA in the second quarter of 2006. In December 2005, the Company completed the submission to the FDA of the NDA for dasatinib to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic, accelerated or blast phases, as well as Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The NDA seeks approval of dasatinib, an investigational multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, to treat adult chronic myelogenous leukemia. On March 7, 2006, the NDA was accepted and granted priority review for accelerated approval. In January 2006, the Company also submitted an MAA for dasatinib to the EMEA. In December 2005, the FDA approved ORENCIA and it became commercially available in the U.S. in February 2006. In January 2006, the Company completed submission of the sBLA to the FDA for the licensure of a third-party manufacturing facility to support increased production capacity for ORENCIA. In December 2005, Exelixis, Inc., (Exelixis) and the Company entered into a collaboration agreement to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies targeted against the Liver X Receptor (LXR), a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Under the collaboration, the companies will jointly identify drug candidates that are ready for Investigational New Drug Application-enabling studies. The Company will undertake further preclinical development and would be responsible for clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing and sales/marketing activities for such compounds. Terms of the agreement include an upfront payment from the Company of approximately $18 million to Exelixis and will provide research and development funding of approximately $10 million per year for an initial period of two years. Exelixis also may receive pre-specified development and regulatory milestones totaling approximately $140 million per product for up to two products from the collaboration, as well as sales milestones and royalties on sales of products commercialized under the collaboration. The agreement received statutory clearance and became effective on January 31, 2006. In October 2005, the FDA issued an approvable letter for muraglitazar requesting additional information from ongoing clinical trials to more fully address the cardiovascular safety profile of the product. The Company, while continuing discussions with the FDA, has determined that it will likely have to initiate additional new trials to gain regulatory approval and is considering a range of options, including conducting such additional studies or terminating further developments of muraglitazar. The additional studies could take approximately five years to complete. In December 2005, the Company and Merck terminated their collaboration agreement for muraglitazar with all rights returning to the Company as of December 21, 2005. As a result of the termination of the agreement, the Company recognized $143 million of deferred income in the fourth quarter of 2005, which was recorded in Other expense, net. The Company has a composition of matter patent which expires in the United States in 2020. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. and Canadian Consumer Medicines business and related assets (Consumer Medicines) to Novartis AG (Novartis). Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis acquired the trademarks, patents and intellectual property rights of Consumer Medicines for $661 million in cash, of which $15 million is attributable to a post-closing supply arrangement between the Company and Novartis. The related assets include the rights to the U.S. Consumer Medicines brands in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $569 million ($370 million net of tax) in the third quarter of 2005, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In June 2005, the Company completed a manufacturing agreement with Celltrion, Inc. for the manufacture of biologic products being developed by the Company. 61 In April 2005, all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics, including the Company, received a request from the FDA to add a boxed warning to their U.S. drug labeling noting an increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis compared with placebo in patients with dementia-related psychosis. The Company has changed the U.S. drug labeling for ABILIFY* in response to the FDA request. ABILIFY* is not approved for the treatment of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In March 2005, the FDA approved ABILIFY* tablets and oral solution for maintaining efficacy in patients with Bipolar I Disorder with a recent manic or mixed episode who had been stabilized and then maintained for at least six weeks. The latest FDA approval is based on the positive results of a trial designed to compare the maintenance of efficacy of ABILIFY* versus placebo, measured by time to relapse. In March 2005, the Company received approval from the FDA for BARACLUDE, an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The drug became available in the U.S. in April 2005. The composition of matter patent covering BARACLUDE expires in the U.S. in October 2010, but may be eligible for statutory patent term extension beyond that date. In the second half of 2005, the Company received approvals for BARACLUDE from international authorities including China, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia and Argentina. Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $5.8 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company continues to maintain a sufficient level of working capital, which was approximately $5.4 billion at December 31, 2005, increasing from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2004. In 2006 and future periods, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with existing cash and borrowings from the capital markets, to sufficiently cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures (which the Company expects to include substantial investments in facilities to increase and maintain the Company capacity to provide biologics on a commercial scale), milestone payments and dividends paid in the United States. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working-capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near-term operations. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company disclosed that it anticipated repatriating approximately $9 billion in special dividends in 2005 and recorded a $575 million provision for deferred income taxes pursuant to the AJCA as enacted and other pending matters. The Company repatriated approximately $6.2 billion from foreign subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2005 and repatriated the remaining balance of approximately $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company expects that approximately all of the $9 billion repatriated in 2005 will qualify as special dividends subject to finalization of its 2005 U.S. federal income tax return and any related tax examinations by the IRS. The Company has used and expects to continue to use the special dividends in accordance with requirements established by the AJCA and the U.S. Treasury Department. During the second quarter of 2005, the U.S. Treasury Department issued AJCA related guidance clarifying that the gross-up for foreign taxes associated with the special dividends also qualifies for the 5.25% tax rate established by the AJCA. As a result of this guidance, the Company reduced the $575 million provision by recording a benefit of approximately $135 million in its tax provision for 2005. Except for earnings associated with the special dividends discussed above, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on the balance of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since the Company has invested or expects to invest such earnings permanently offshore. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2005 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Marketable securities at December 31, 2005 primarily consisted of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate instruments with an AAA/Aaa credit rating. Due to the nature of these instruments, the Company considers it reasonable to expect that their fair market values will not be significantly impacted by a change in interest rates, and that they can be liquidated for cash at short notice. The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 4.1% and 2.3% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, while interest yields on marketable securities averaged 4.4% and 2.5%, respectively. Short-term borrowings at the end of 2005 and 2004 were $231 million and $1,883 million, respectively, with the reduction of these borrowings due primarily to the retirement of commercial paper. The Company maintains cash balances and short-term investments in excess of short-term borrowings. Long-term debt at December 31, 2005 was denominated primarily in U.S. dollars but also included Japanese yen debt of $166 million. Long-term debt was $8.4 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to $8.5 billion at December 31, 2004. In August 2005, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a new $2.5 billion term loan facility with a syndicate of lenders. Borrowings under this facility are guaranteed by the Company, the subsidiaries of the borrower and by certain European subsidiaries of the Company. This facility contains a five-year tranche of up to $2.0 billion and a two-year tranche of up to $500 million. The Company is subject to substantially the same covenants as those included in its December 2004 Revolving Credit facility. The Company is also subject to further restrictions, including certain financial covenants. Prior to borrowing any proceeds against the facility, the Company obtained a waiver from the lenders for a covenant default under this facility due to a one-time intercompany distribution. At December 31, 2005, this facility was fully drawn and the Company was in full compliance with all covenants. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased all of its outstanding $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount 4.75% Notes due 2006, and incurred an aggregate pre-tax loss of approximately $69 million in connection with the early redemption of the Notes and termination of related interest rate swaps. In December 2004, the Company replaced its prior $1 billion revolving credit facilities with a new $2 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders, which is extendable on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. The availability of the facility is subject to the Company ability at the time of borrowing to meet certain conditions, including a financial covenant in which net debt to capital cannot exceed 50%. This facility does not contain a material adverse change representation in the Company business as a condition to borrowing. There were no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company has been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of the new facility, and as of December 31, 2005 and 2005, the Company had a ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated capital of 14%. Changes in public credit ratings will not affect the availability of the credit facility. The Company also had unused short-term lines of credit with foreign banks of $198 million and $158 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 62 A majority of the Company debt is fixed rate. The Company, however, has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps for $3.4 billion of its long-term debt. Interest expense, net of interest swap gains, was $349 million, $310 million, and $277 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to higher interest rates; the increase in 2004 over 2003 was primarily due to increased short-term borrowings and higher interest rates. The Moody Investors Service (Moody s) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A1 and Prime-1, respectively. After the Company long-term debt rating being under review for downgrade by Moody s, on February 15, 2006, Moody affirmed the A1 long-term rating. The Company Prime-1 short-term rating was not under review. The long-term rating retains a negative outlook. Standard & Poor (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings for the Company are currently A+ and A-1, respectively. S&P long-term credit rating remains on negative outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit rating for the Company are currently A+ and F1, respectively. In September 2005, Fitch long-term credit rating on the Company was changed from negative to stable outlook. The following is a discussion of working capital and cash flow activities: (Dollars in Millions) December 31, 2005 2004 Working Capital $ 5,393 $ 4,958 (Dollars in Millions) Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 1,836 $ 3,176 $ 3,512 Investing activities 1,191 (1,622 ) (2,419 ) Financing activities (3,637 ) (463 ) (1,031 ) The increase in working capital of $435 million from 2004 was primarily due to: reduction in income taxes payable resulting from payments related to the repatriation of special dividends under the AJCA; lower unrealized losses from derivatives resulting from the weakening of the euro; lower accrued liability for product liability, rebates and returns partially offset by lower receivables resulting from collection of foreign withholding taxes and lower sales volume; higher reserves for litigation matters; and higher inventories due to increased demand of newer products and existing key brands. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion in 2005, $3.2 billion in 2004 and $3.5 billion in 2003. The decreases in both 2005 and 2004 are mainly attributable to lower earnings and higher usage of working capital. The significant changes in operating assets and liabilities from 2005 and 2004 are: a $762 million decrease in income tax payable primarily related to the settlement of examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 1998 through 2001 and benefits arising from the resolution of certain tax contingencies; a $626 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily due to vendor payments prior to the sale of the OTN business and lower accrued rebates and returns; a $204 million decrease in litigation settlement payments compared to 2004 and $307 million of insurance recoveries in 2005; a $237 million increase in inventories due to the growth of newer products and in anticipation of new product launches; a $231 million decrease in other liabilities primarily due to milestone receipts for the muraglitazar compound in 2004; and a $1,095 million decrease in receivables primarily due to lower sales volume and foreign withholding taxes. The significant changes in operating assets and liabilities between 2004 and 2003 are: a $350 million decrease in deferred revenue due to the workdown of consignment inventory in 2003; a $260 million increase in inventory primarily due to the introduction of new products including REYATAZ and ERBITUX*, higher demand for key brands including PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE* and SUSTIVA and a $146 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses including advertising and promotion, deferred revenue for ABILIFY*and milestone payments. Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.2 billion in 2005 compared to net cash used of $1.6 billion in 2004 and $2.4 billion in 2003. The $2,813 million increase in 2005 is attributable to the sale of marketable securities in 2005, proceeds from sale of the Consumer Medicines business for $646 million in 2005 and a one time $250 million milestone payment to ImClone in 2004. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2004 is mainly attributable to lower purchases in marketable securities, $364 million cash proceeds from the sale of the Company Adult Nutritional business and $261 million of lower capital spending, partially offset by a milestone payment of $250 million to ImClone, a $150 million payment for the Acordis acquisition and increased purchases of trademarks, patents and licenses. 63 Net cash used in financing activities was $3.6 billion in 2005, $0.5 billion in 2004 and $1.0 billion in 2003. The $3,174 million increase in 2005 was mainly attributable to the retirement of commercial paper, and the repurchase of all of the Company outstanding $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount 4.75% Notes due 2006, partially offset by $2.5 billion borrowings against its new term loan facility. The decrease in 2004 from 2003 was mainly attributable to an increase in short-term borrowings in 2004 partially offset by the proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt in 2003. Cash provided from operations and borrowings were primarily used over the past three years to pay dividends of approximately $6.5 billion. The Company has also invested approximately $2.4 billion over the past three years in capital expansion to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities. Over the past three years, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock. The total shares acquired since the share repurchase program inception is 372 million shares. The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit. This program is intended to reduce the increase in shares outstanding from option exercises and to obtain shares for general corporate purposes. Dividends declared per common share were $1.12 for each of 2005, 2004 and 2003. In December 2005, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $.28 per common share and indicated a dividend for the full year 2006 of $1.12 per share. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by the Company Board of Directors. The Company financial condition and liquidity could be affected by obligations to make milestone or other one-time payments and by the outcome of pending litigations and investigations, including the challenge to the PLAVIX* patent.

Contractual Obligations Payments due by period for the Company contractual obligations at December 31, 2005, are as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period (Dollars in Millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 231 $ 231 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt (1) 8,364 504 1,715 3 2,030 4,112 Operating leases 475 129 105 81 58 34 68 Purchase obligations 2,035 486 368 404 389 275 113 Stand-by letters of credit/performance guarantees 74 32 40 2 Pension and other liabilities 1,259 251 219 205 195 187 202 Total $ 12,438 $ 1,129 $ 1,236 $ 2,405 $ 645 $ 2,526 $ 4,497 (1) 2006 long-term debt obligations are included in short-term borrowings on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 and all balances approximate the outstanding nominal long-term debt values. The contractual obligations table above excludes interest payment obligations. The Company convertible debenture is included as due for payment in 2008, as it contains a 2008 put and call feature. In addition to the above, the Company has committed to make potential future milestone payments to third-parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion of contractual obligations, reference is made to Item 8. Financial Statements Note 14. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, Note 16. Financial Instruments, Note 18. Leases and Note 19. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. SEC Consent Order and Deferred Prosecution Agreement As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, the Company entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent Order (Consent), a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to the Company quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. 64 Under the terms of the Consent, the Company has agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to its direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. The Company has also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that it has implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of its annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer the Company accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that the Company budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just those that come from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. Further, the Company agreed in the Consent to retain an Independent Adviser through the date that the Company Form 10-K for the year ended 2005 is filed with the SEC. The Independent Adviser continues to serve as the Independent Monitor under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) discussed below. The Consent defines certain powers and responsibilities of the Independent Adviser. The Consent includes a process for the Independent Adviser to make recommendations regarding the Company compliance with applicable federal securities laws and corporate obligations. The Company has agreed in the Consent to adopt the Independent Adviser recommendations regarding compliance with applicable federal securities laws and corporate obligations. As previously disclosed, on June 15, 2005, the Company entered into a DPA with the United States Attorney Office (USAO) for the District of New Jersey resolving the investigation by the USAO of the Company relating to wholesaler inventory and various accounting matters covered by the Company settlement with the SEC. Pursuant to the DPA, the USAO filed a criminal complaint against the Company alleging conspiracy to commit securities fraud, but will defer prosecution of the Company and dismiss the complaint after two years if the Company satisfies all of the requirements of the DPA. A copy of the DPA was filed as Exhibit 99.2 to a Form 8-K filed by the Company on June 16, 2005 and is incorporated by reference hereto as Exhibit 10w. Under the DPA, among other things, the Company has agreed to include in its Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC and in its annual report to shareholders the following information: (a) estimated wholesaler/direct customer inventory levels of the top fifteen (15) products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceuticals business; (b) for major non-U.S. countries, estimated aggregate wholesaler/direct-customer inventory levels of the top fifteen (15) pharmaceutical products sold in such countries taken as a whole measured by aggregate annual sales in such countries; (c) arrangements with and policies concerning wholesaler/direct customers and other distributors for these products, including efforts by the Company to control and monitor wholesaler/distributor inventory levels; and (d) data concerning prescriptions or other measures of end-user demand for these products. Pursuant to the DPA, the Company also will include in such filings and reports information on acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring reserve policies and activity, and rebate accrual policies and activity. The Company also agreed to implement remedial measures already undertaken or mandated in the Consent and in the settlements of the derivative litigation and the federal securities class action relating to wholesaler inventory and various accounting matters. In addition, the Company agreed to undertake additional remedial actions, corporate reforms and other actions, including: (a) appointing an additional non-executive Director acceptable to the USAO; (b) establishing and maintaining a training and education program on topics that include corporate citizenship and financial reporting obligations; (c) making an additional $300 million payment into the shareholder compensation fund established in connection with the Consent; (d) not engaging in or attempting to engage in any criminal conduct as that term is defined in the DPA; (e) continuing to cooperate with the USAO, including with respect to the ongoing investigation regarding individual current and former employees of the Company; and (f) retaining an Irdependent Monitor. Also as part of the DPA, the Board of Directors separated the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and on June 15, 2005, elected a Non-Executive Chairman. The Independent Monitor, who also serves as the Independent Adviser pursuant to the Consent, has defined powers and responsibilities under the DPA, including the responsibility to oversee at least through April 2007, the Company compliance with all of the terms of the DPA, the Consent and the settlements of the derivative action and the federal securities class action. The Monitor has the authority to require the Company to take any steps he believes necessary to comply with the terms of the DPA and the Company is required to adopt all recommendations made by the Monitor, unless the Company objects to the recommendation and the USAO agrees that adoption of the recommendation should not be required. In addition, the Independent Monitor will report to the USAO, on at least a quarterly basis, as to the Company compliance with the DPA and the implementation and effectiveness of the internal controls, financial reporting, disclosure processes and related compliance functions of the Company. The Company has established a company-wide policy to limit its sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy will be monitored on a regular basis. 65 The Company maintains inventory management agreements (IMAs) with most of its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers that account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, the Company three largest wholesaler customers provide the Company with weekly information with respect to months on hand product level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers currently account for over 90% of total gross sales of U.S. pharmaceutical products. The inventory information received from these wholesalers, together with the Company internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. The Company estimates months on hand product inventory levels for its U.S. Pharmaceutical business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for three largest wholesalers. The Company considers whether any adjustments are necessary to these extrapolated amounts based on such factors as historical sales of individual products made to such other wholesalers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand. In contrast, for the Company Pharmaceutical business outside of the United States, Nutritionals and Other Health Care business units around the world, the Company has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, the Company relies on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. The Company discloses for each of its top fifteen (15) pharmaceutical products sold by the U.S. Pharmaceutical business (based on 2004 net sales) the amount of net sales and the estimated number of months on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter and as of the end of the applicable quarter in its quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. The Company discloses corresponding information for the top fifteen (15) pharmaceutical products sold within its major non-U.S. countries, as described above. For all other business units, the Company will continue to disclose on a quarterly basis the key product level inventories. The information required to estimate months on hand product level inventories in the direct customer distribution for the non-U.S. Pharmaceutical businesses is not available prior to the filing of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for an applicable quarter. Accordingly, the Company discloses this information on its website approximately 60 days after the end of the applicable quarter, and in the Company Form 10-Q for the following quarter. In addition to the foregoing quarterly disclosure, the Company includes all the foregoing information for all business units for each quarter in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. For non-key products, if the inventory at direct customers exceeds approximately one month on hand, the Company will disclose the estimated months on hand for such product(s), except where the impact on the Company is de minimis. The Company has enhanced and will continue to enhance its methods to estimate months on hand product inventory levels for the U.S. Pharmaceutical business and for the non-U.S. Pharmaceutical businesses around the world, taking into account the complexities described above. The Company also has taken and will continue to take steps to expedite the receipt and processing of data for the non-U.S. Pharmaceutical businesses. The Company believes the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with both the Consent Order and the DPA and provides sufficient information to comply with disclosure requirements of both. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , which replaces Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements . This pronouncement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and revises the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. This pronouncement also requires that a change in the method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of SFAS No. 154. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). FIN 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Asset retirement obligations covered by FIN 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, even if the timing and method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 66 In December 2004, the FASB issued revised SFAS No. 123 (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment . This standard eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value-based method under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 123R to financial statements issued for the first annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 using the prospective transition method. As a result of the provisions in SFAS 123R and Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, the Company estimates that the compensation charges related to share-based compensation for 2006 to be on a pre-tax basis between $135 million and $145 million which includes $80 million to $85 million of stock option expense due to the adoption of this standard. On an after tax basis, the compensation charges related to share-based compensation for 2006 are estimated to be between $85 million and $91 million and the stock option expense due to the adoption of this standard included in these after tax amounts is $50 million to $54 million. However, the assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the Company stock price as well as a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impacts. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of the Company stock price and employee stock exercise behaviors. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Stock Compensation Plans. In December 2004, the FASB issued final staff position (FSP) No. 109-1, Application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 . The FSP provides that the deduction on qualified production activities will be treated as a special deduction as described in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . Accordingly, the tax effect of this deduction will be reported as a component of the Company current tax provision and will not have an effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Department of the Treasury recently issued Proposed Tax Regulations with respect to the Deduction on Qualified Production Activities . The Company is evaluating the impact of the Proposed Tax Regulations and the FSP on its income tax provision and results of operations. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets . The provisions of this Statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and should be applied prospectively. The Statement eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions , and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The standard requires abnormal amounts of idle facility and related expenses to be recognized as current period charges and also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act). The Medicare Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. FSP No. 106-2 requires that the effects of the new law be accounted for under SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The Company adopted FSP No. 106-2 in the third quarter of 2004, retroactive to January 1, 2004. There was a reduction in net periodic benefit cost for other benefits of $8 million for 2004, based on the re-measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of January 1, 2004. The effect of the adoption of FSP No. 106-2 was not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 19. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-06, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method Under FAS 128 , which requires the use of the two-class method of computing earnings per share for those enterprises with participating securities or multiple classes of common stock. The consensus is effective for fiscal periods beginning after March 31, 2004. The adoption of EITF No. 03-06 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB revised Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 (as revised) apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 67 Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the Company financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion represents its critical accounting policies. Management and the Company independent registered public accounting firm have discussed the Company critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements , as amended by SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition . The Company accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. The Company recognizes revenue when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment, with the exceptions described below. In previous years, certain transactions with the Company U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers were accounted for using the consignment model. In the case of sales made to wholesalers (1) as a result of incentives, (2) in excess of the wholesaler ordinary course of business inventory level, (3) at a time when there was an understanding, agreement, course of dealing or consistent business practice that the Company would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases, and (4) at a time when such incentives would cover substantially all, and vary directly with, the wholesaler cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler ordinary course of business inventory level, substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment, and accordingly, such sales should be accounted for using the consignment model. The determination of when, if at all, sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments. Under the consignment model, the Company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product the Company invoices the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price, and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the Company cost of such inventory. The Company recognizes revenue (net of the gross to net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments) when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements, but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers, on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. In the case of new products for which the product introduction is not an extension of an existing line of product or where the Company determines that there are not products in a similar therapeutic category, or where the Company determines the new product has dissimilar characteristics with existing products, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. For discussions on revenue recognition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition, Sales Rebate and Return Accruals. Gross to Net Sales Adjustments The Company has the following significant categories of gross to net sales adjustments that impact the Company three reportable segments: prime vendor charge-backs, WIC rebates, managed health care rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, sales returns, and other adjustments, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments and require the Company to use information from external sources. The Company accounts for these gross to net sales adjustments in accordance with EITF Issue No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor Products) , and SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, as applicable. See Net Sales section above for reconciliations of the Company gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments. Prime vendor charge-backs The Company U.S. businesses participate in prime vendor programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the 68 lower prime vendor price, and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower prime vendor price back to the Company. The Company accounts for prime vendor charge-backs by reducing accounts receivable in an amount equal to the Company estimate of charge-back claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the prime vendor charge-backs primarily based on historical experience regarding prime vendor charge-backs and current contract prices under the prime vendor programs. The Company considers prime vendor payments, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and the Company claim processing time lag and adjusts the reduction to accounts receivable periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. WIC rebates The Company U.S. Nutritionals business participates on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states, tribal governments, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Under these programs, the Company reimburses these entities for the difference between wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products. The Company accounts for WIC rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of WIC rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the WIC rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding WIC rebates and current contract prices under the WIC programs. The Company considers levels of inventory in the distribution channel, new WIC contracts, terminated WIC contracts, changes in existing WIC contracts, and WIC participation and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Managed health care rebates and other contract discounts The Company offers rebates and discounts to managed health care organizations in the U.S. and globally to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations. The Company accounts for managed health care rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of managed health care rebates and other contract discounts attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the managed health care rebates and other contract discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices. The Company considers the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Medicaid rebates The Company U.S. businesses participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. Discounts and rebates provided through these latter programs are included in the Company Medicaid rebate accrual and are considered Medicaid rebates for the purposes of this discussion. The Company accounts for Medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of Medicaid rebate claims attributable to a sale. The Company determines its estimate of the Medicaid rebates accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding Medicaid rebates, as well as any expansion on a prospective basis of its participation in the non-mandatory aspects of the qualifying federal and state government programs, legal interpretations of the applicable laws related to the Medicaid and qualifying federal and state government programs, and any new information regarding changes in the Medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates. The Company considers outstanding Medicaid claims, Medicaid payments, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Cash discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, the Company offers cash discounts, generally approximately 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt payment. The Company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts. The Company considers payment performance and adjusts the accrual to reflect actual experience. Sales returns The Company accounts for sales returns in accordance with SFAS No. 48 by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, provision for sales returns were $164 million, $276 million and $348 million, respectively, or 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively, of gross sales. For returns of established products, the Company determines its estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns but also considers other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. The Company considers all of these factors and adjusts the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. 69 The Company considers the level of inventory in the distribution channel and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. For example, if levels of inventory in the distribution channel increase, the Company analyzes the reasons for the increase. If the reasons indicate that sales returns will be larger than expected, the Company adjusts the sales return accrual, taking into account historical experience, the Company returned goods policy and the shelf life of the Company products, which ranges, on average, from approximately 12 to 48 months. In situations where the Company is aware of products in the distribution channel nearing their expiration date, the Company analyzes the situation. If the analysis indicates that sales returns will be larger than expected, the Company adjusts the sales return accrual, taking into account historical experience, the Company returned goods policy, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel. In the event of a product recall or product discontinuance, the Company considers the reasons for and impact of such actions and adjusts the sales return accrual as appropriate, taking into account historical experience, levels of inventory in the distribution channel and, for product discontinuances, estimates of continuing demand. Although the Company considers price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products, the Company generally does not believe that these factors impact sales returns based on historical experience and the Company returned goods policy. Returns from new products are significantly more difficult for the Company to assess. The Company determines its estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products, such as those within the same line of product or those within the same or similar therapeutic category. In limited circumstances, where the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where the Company has no historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category, such that the Company cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until the Company has developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. The Company also considers the shelf life of new products and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The shelf life in connection with new products tends to be shorter than the shelf life for more established products because the Company may still be developing an optimal manufacturing process for the new product that would lengthen its shelf life, or an amount of launch quantities may have been manufactured in advance of the launch date to ensure sufficient supply exists to satisfy market demand. In those cases, the Company assesses the reduced shelf life, together with levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand, and determines whether it believes an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. Other adjustments In addition to the significant gross to net sales adjustments described above, the Company makes other gross to net sales adjustments. For example, the Company offers sales discounts, most significantly in its non-U.S. businesses, and also offers consumer coupons and rebates, most significantly in its U.S. Nutritionals and Pharmaceuticals businesses. In addition, in a number of countries outside the U.S., including major European countries, the Company provides rebates to government entities. The Company generally accounts for these other gross to net adjustments by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the Company estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale. The Company generally determines its estimates of the accruals for these other gross to net sales adjustments primarily based on historical experience, performance on commitments to government entities and other relevant factors, including levels of inventory in the distribution channel in some cases, and adjusts the accruals periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Use of Information from External Sources The Company uses information from external sources to estimate its significant gross to net sales adjustments. The Company estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on consigned inventory are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for its products and historical inventory experience, as well as the Company analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and the Company internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their record-keeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. The Company receives information from IMS Health (IMS), a supplier of market research to the pharmaceutical industry, which it uses to project the prescription demand-based sales for many of its U.S. Pharmaceutical products. The Company has historically reported estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on National Prescription Audit (NPA) data, which IMS makes available to the public on a subscription basis, and a simple average of the estimated number of prescriptions in the retail and mail order channels. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company began disclosing estimated total U.S. prescription growth and estimated therapeutic category share based on both NPA and Next-Generation Prescription Services (NGPS) data. NGPS data are collected by IMS under a new, revised methodology and have been released by IMS 70 on a limited basis through a pilot program. IMS has publicly announced that it expects to make NGPS data available to the public on a subscription basis in 2007. The Company believes that the NGPS data provided by IMS provide a superior estimate of prescription data for the Company products in the retail and mail order channels. The Company has calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription growth and the estimated therapeutic category share based on NGPS data on a weighted average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied compared with retail prescriptions. The Company believes that calculation of the estimated total U.S. prescription growth and the estimated therapeutic category share based on the NGPS data and the weighted average approach with respect to the retail and mail order channels provide a superior estimate of total prescription demand. The Company now uses this methodology for its internal demand forecasts. The Company also uses information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. The Company estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which the Company receives third-party information. Retirement Benefits The Company pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , and SFAS No. 106 , Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions . The Company considers accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. Plan Description The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and termination indemnity plans for regular full-time employees. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan and the principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. Approximately 80% of total Company defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities are held in U.S. plans. The assets for the U.S. plans are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to total Company plans (i.e., U.S. plans together with international plans). Benefits under the Company defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation. Assets under the Company defined benefit plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2005, the fair market value of plan assets for the Company defined benefit plans increased to $5,017 million from $4,602 million at December 31, 2004. For the U.S. plans, assets were allocated 68% to equity securities (compared to 70% at the end of 2004), 25% to fixed income securities (compared to 23% at the end of 2004) and 7% to private equity and other investments (compared to 7% at the end of 2004). Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock represented less than 1% of assets for the U.S. plans at the end of 2005 and 2004. The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company comprehensive medical and group life plans. The asset allocation for these postretirement plans is identical to the asset allocation described above for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions Consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , the Company accounts for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. The Company key assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The Company, in consultation with its actuaries, evaluates the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits, such as retirement, turnover and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determines such assumptions on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. 71 In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of its plans estimated payouts. The Citigroup Above Median yield curve is used in determining the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The assumed rate of compensation increase used by the Company for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors. In 2005, net pension expense for the Company defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes was $392 million compared to $276 million in 2004. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2005 was determined using a 5.75% assumed discount rate and a 3.56% assumed rate of compensation increase. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2005 for the U.S. plans was determined using the same rates. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2005 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have increased by approximately $18 million. If the assumed rate of compensation increase used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2005 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have decreased by approximately $9 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2005 had been reduced by 0.25%, the accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by $128 million. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2005 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2005 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $34 million. Actual rates of return earned on U.S. plan assets for each of the last 10 years were as follows: Year Return Year Return 2005 9.8 % 2000 3.5 % 2004 12.6 % 1999 18.2 % 2003 25.0 % 1998 13.3 % 2002 (13.4 )% 1997 22.2 % 2001 (6.1 )% 1996 17.0 % As discussed below, GAAP provides that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2005, the Company maintained its assumed discount rate for U.S. plans at 5.75% and maintained its assumed rate of compensation increase at 3.56%. Compensation is assumed to increase on a scale with different rates for different ages. The 3.56% rate disclosed at December 31, 2005 is the single rate which, if used at each age, would produce the same present value of benefit obligations. The Company reduced the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets from 9% in 2004 to 8.75% for 2005 and 2006. The Company expects that the net pension expense for its defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes will be approximately $30 million lower in 2006 than the $392 million in 2005, reflecting primarily the positive delayed impact of the favorable 2003-2005 investment returns. The Company has used the same assumed discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets in calculating its cost of pension benefits and its cost of other postretirement benefits for U.S. plans except in the case of the discount rates at December 31, 2005 and 2004. A rate of 5.75% was used for pension benefits versus 5.50% for other postretirement benefits to reflect the shorter duration of the other postretirement liabilities. U.S. health care costs for the retiree population are assumed to increase 8.0% in 2006 and then trend down to an expected increase of 4.5% per year by 2012. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put significant upward pressure on the Company expense for retiree health care. On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The effects of the Medicare Act are reflected in 2005 net periodic postretirement benefit cost (a reduction of $11 million) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2005 (a reduction of $85 million). Delayed Recognition of Actuarial Gains and Losses At December 31, 2005 and 2004, unrecognized net actuarial losses for the Company defined benefit plans were $2,067 million and $2,017 million, respectively, based on the fair market value of plan assets. These unrecognized net actuarial losses reflect in large part the steady reduction of the weighted-average discount rate over the years. 72 SFAS No. 87 provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated plan benefit obligations due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other assumption changes. SFAS No. 87 requires that unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets (which differs from fair market value and is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years), be amortized in pension income or expense for the year to the extent that such unrecognized net actuarial loss or gain exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. These net gains and losses are recognized as pension income or expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately 10 years) to the extent that they are not offset by losses and gains in subsequent years. At December 31, 2005, the unrecognized net actuarial loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets, was $2,107 million. This amount exceeded 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by $1,515 million. Unless offset by future unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets, amortization of this unrecognized loss is expected to increase pension expense for each of the following 10 years by approximately $152 million per year. At December 31, 2004, the unrecognized net actuarial loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets, was $2,278 million. This amount exceeded 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by $1,730 million. In the event the fair market value of pension plan assets of a particular plan is less than the accumulated benefit obligation for such plan at year-end, GAAP may require an additional minimum liability, and in such circumstances, a reduction in stockholders equity or an establishment of an intangible asset. At December 31, 2005, the fair market value of the Company defined benefit pension plan assets was $5,017 million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $5,209 million. The Company recognized a reduction of $21 million in additional minimum liability (cumulatively $328 million) at December 31, 2005, which was offset by a $20 million increase in other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity and a $1 million reduction in the intangible asset. At December 31, 2004, the fair market value of the Company defined benefit pension plan assets was $4,602 million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $4,828 million. The Company recognized an additional minimum liability of $146 million (cumulatively $349 million) at December 31, 2004, which was offset by a $153 million charge to other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity and a $7 million reduction in the intangible asset. Plan Funding The Company funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service liability. The Company contributed $423 million and $367 million to the defined benefit plans in 2005 and 2004, respectively. For discussions on retirement benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 19. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. Acquired In-Process Research and Development The fair value of in-process research and development acquired in a business combination is determined by independent appraisal based on the present value of each research project projected cash flows. An income approach is utilized that is consistent with guidance in the practice aid issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Assets Acquired in a Business Combination to Be Used in Research and Development Activities: A Focus on Software, Electronic Devices and Pharmaceutical Industries . Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project, consistent with historical pricing, margins, and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles, and the life of each research project underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion. The resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the Company weighted average cost of capital. Other acquired in-process research and development is expensed as incurred when the underlying product has not received regulatory approval and does not have any future alternative use. In addition, costs that are nonrefundable, related to the acquisition or licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval to be marketed and that have no alternative future use, are charged to earnings as incurred. For discussions on acquired in-process research and development, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , the Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an 73 asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. SFAS No. 142 requires that indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment using a one-step process, which consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the intangible asset. Such intangible assets are deemed to be impaired if their net book value exceeds their estimated fair value. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144 as described above. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management judgment. Any changes in key assumptions about the Company businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge. For discussions on impairment of long-lived assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Equity Investments The Company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the Company carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock and related interpretations, which set forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized, including the Company ability to hold its investment, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity, which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company investment in ImClone is subject to this accounting. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Investments for a discussion of the Company investment in ImClone. For discussions on equity investments, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Investments and Note 2. Alliances and Investments. Restructuring To downsize and streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities, the Company has periodically recorded restructuring charges. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates, resulting in an adjustment to earnings. For discussions on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Restructuring and Note 3. Restructuring and Other Items. Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, and tax matters. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , the Company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes, Contingencies, Note 8. Income Taxes and Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes Deferred Taxes The Company evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that it will realize its deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning strategies. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. 74 The Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $975 million and U.S. research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $120 million, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012. Realization of the foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company anticipates increasing its level of domestic profitability over time by undertaking actions such as increasing its biologics manufacturing capacity in the U.S. While increasing domestic profitability will likely cause the Company effective tax rate to increase, it will also further enhance the Company ability to utilize its foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards. The amount of foreign tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the outcome of the PLAVIX* litigation in the U.S. is unfavorable, and/or if the timing of generic competition for PLAVIX* were to be accelerated. If such events occur, the Company may need to record significant additional valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. For additional information on PLAVIX* litigation, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Tax Contingencies The Company conducts business in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company files a significant number of tax returns that are subject to examination by various tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by the Company and may require several years to resolve. The Company establishes liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities. Such amounts represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $8.4 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which taxes have not been provided as the Company has invested or expects to invest these undistributed earnings permanently offshore. If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the United States, or if the Company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided. For discussions on income taxes, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Note 8. Income Taxes. Outlook As previously disclosed, anticipated sales declines during 2006 due to continued exclusivity losses are expected to be more or less offset by growth in net sales of the Company growth drivers and potential new products during the same period. Additionally, gross margin is expected to stabilize in 2006 as relatively high margins realized on the sale of growth drivers and certain new products more or less offset lost margins from older products that have lost or are expected to lose exclusivity. However, earnings will be adversely affected by the Company investments to support the introduction of new products, the loss of revenues related to the sale of a product asset, the impact of the adoption of the expensing of stock options under new accounting guidelines and the development of additional new compounds. In addition, as previously disclosed, the Company has experienced substantial revenue losses in the last few years due to the expiration of market exclusivity protection for certain of its products. For 2006, the Company estimates reductions of net sales in the range of $1.4 to $1.5 billion from 2005 levels representing continuing declines in revenues of those products as well as declines in revenues of certain additional products that have lost and will continue to lose market exclusivity protection in 2003 to 2006. These products (and the years in which they lost or will lose exclusivity protection) include GLUCOPHAGE*IR/GLUCOVANCE*/GLUCOPHAGE*XR in the United States (2000 to 2004), TAXOL (paclitaxel) in Europe (2003) and Japan (2006 to 2013), PRAVACHOL in the United States (2006) and in Europe (2002 to 2007) and CEFZIL in the United States (2005). In 2007, revenue reductions due to exclusivity losses are anticipated to begin to moderate from 2006 levels as no major new exclusivity losses are expected. The timing and amounts of sales reductions from exclusivity losses, their realization in particular periods and the eventual levels of remaining sales revenues are uncertain and dependent on the levels of sales at the time exclusivity protection ends, the timing and degree of development of generic competition (speed of approvals, market entry and impact) and other factors. 75 The Company expectations for future sales growth include substantial expected increases in sales of PLAVIX*, which had net sales of $3.8 billion for 2005, and is currently the Company largest product ranked by net sales. The composition of matter patent for PLAVIX*, which expires in 2011, is currently the subject of litigation in the United States, with a trial scheduled to begin in June 2006. Similar proceedings involving PLAVIX* are ongoing in Canada. There are no enforcement proceedings outside the U.S. and Canada. The Company continues to believe that the patent is valid and that it is infringed, and with its alliance partner and patent-holder Sanofi, is vigorously pursuing these cases. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the outcome of these litigations, or if there were an adverse determination in these litigations, the timing of potential generic competition for PLAVIX*. Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corporation (Apotex) announced that on January 2006 it had received final approval of its aNDA for clopidogrel bisulfate from the FDA. Accordingly, Apotex could decide to launch a generic product at risk at any time. Such generic competition would likely result in substantial decreases in the sales of PLAVIX* in the United States. As the Company adds to its product line and realigns its focus over the next several years, the Company expects to devote substantial resources in excess of historical levels to meet heightened processing standards that may be required for sterile or newly introduced products, such as biologics. As biologics become more important to the Company product portfolio, the Company may continue to make arrangements with third party manufacturers, and expects to make substantial investments to increase its internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. In March 2006, for example, the Board of Directors approved a capital expenditure in the amount of $660 million for the construction of an expandable, large-scale multi-product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in the U.S. The facility will be modular in design in order to accomodate future expansion. In 2006 and future periods, the Company expects cash generated by its U.S. operations, together with existing cash and borrowings from the capital markets to sufficiently cover cach needs for working capital, capital expenditures (including any substantial investments in facilities to increase and maintain the Company capacity to provide biologics on a commercial scale, as noted above), milestone payments and dividends paid in the United States. The Company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any future lawsuits, claims and proceedings will not be material to the Company. In addition, there is an increasing trend by foreign governments to scrutinize sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical companies and there can be no assurance that any such investigation or any other investigation will not be material. It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations. Management continues to believe, as previously disclosed, that during the next few years, the aggregate impact, beyond current reserves, of these and other legal matters affecting the Company is reasonably likely to be material to the Company results of operations and cash flows, and may be material to its financial condition and liquidity. The Company expectations for the next several years described above do not reflect the potential impact of litigation on the Company results of operations. Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , will , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the Company goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. The Company has included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this annual report, particularly under Item 1A. Risk Factors , that the Company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Although the Company believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 76
