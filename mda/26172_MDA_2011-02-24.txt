ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights 2011 Outlook Results of Operations Restructuring and Other Charges Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 29 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related component products, including filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc., Chrysler Group, LLC, Daimler Trucks North America, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG, Ford Motor Company, Komatsu, Volvo AB and Case New Holland. We serve our customers through a network of more than 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,000 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers' access to credit. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by political, economic and regulatory matters, including environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. In 2010, emerging markets recovered with stronger demand in China, India and Brazil, while we started to see modest but uneven signs of recovery in developed markets. As we expected, after the strong demand in the second half of 2009, in advance of the 2010 United States (U.S.) emission change, demand for heavy-duty on-highway products in North America decreased approximately 61 percent in 2010 versus 2009. In addition, medium-duty truck shipments in North America decreased 34 percent in 2010 versus 2009. Excluding North American on-highway markets, overall order trends improved and were consistent with our expectations of organic revenue growth in 2010. In recognition of the global economic challenges, we launched significant restructuring initiatives in late 2008 and 2009 that were designed to reduce structural and overhead costs across all of our businesses, improve operational performance, strengthen our position in emerging markets and prepare to capitalize on the eventual recovery in North America and Europe. These initiatives helped to mitigate the adverse volume impacts that certain markets experienced and they better position us for when a more robust economic recovery extends beyond the emerging markets. Despite the slow recovery in the U.S. markets and Europe, we were able to operate much more efficiently and, as a result, recorded the most profitable results in our history in 2010. 30 Table of Contents The following table contains sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) results by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Refer to the section titled "Operating Segment Results" later in MD&A for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before taxes.

We recorded restructuring and other charges of $99 million ($65 million after - -tax, or $0.33 per diluted share) in 2009. For a detailed discussion of restructuring see Note 22, "RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in income was driven by higher volumes in emerging markets, price improvements, increased equity income, decreased warranty expenses and restructuring charges incurred in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. These were partially offset by higher income tax expense, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses in 2010 as compared to 2009. In 2010, we recorded a pre-tax recovery of $32 million ($21 million after -tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) related to the overpayment of revenue based taxes on imported products in Brazil from 2004-2008. The tax recovery was recorded in cost of sales in our non segment business results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year. We generated $1,006 million of operating cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, compared to $1,137 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009. Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" later in the MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In December 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock. In February 2009, we temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash through the U.S. recession. We resumed stock repurchases under our Board authorization in the fourth quarter of 2009 and we have repurchased $241 million of common stock during 2010. In February 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of Cummins common stock. In July 2010, our Board authorized a dividend increase of 50 percent to $0.2625 effective in the third quarter. Our debt to capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2010, was 14.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009. We currently have a Baa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody's Investors Services, a BBB+ credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard and Poor's and a BBB+ credit rating and a positive outlook from Fitch. In addition to the $1.362 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have sufficient access to our revolver and accounts receivable program to meet currently anticipated growth and funding needs. 31 Table of Contents Our global pension plans, including our unfunded non-qualified plans, were 96 percent funded at year-end 2010. The U.S. qualified plan, which is approximately 62 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 99 percent funded, and the international plans were 107 percent funded. Asset returns in 2010 for the U.S. qualified plan were 15.2 percent while the year-end 2010 discount rate was 5.40%, down 0.20 percentage points from the 2009 discount rate of 5.60%. We expect to contribute $130 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2011. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2010. We expect pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2011 to decrease by approximately $5 million pre-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, when compared to 2010. Refer to application of critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 11, "PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements , for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 2011 OUTLOOK Near-Term: In 2010, economies in emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil, recovered and we started to see signs of economic recovery in developed markets. We expect the following positive trends in 2011: Markets for the majority of our products in China, India and Brazil should continue to grow, but at a slower pace than experienced in 2010 and we are expanding our capacity in China and India to meet the expected demand. Our markets in North America are expected to improve, especially with the anticipated strong recovery of on-highway truck markets and a significant improvement in our power generation markets. Other markets for our products will continue to expand, including Mexico, the Middle East and Europe. We expect most of our other markets to continue to grow. We expect the following challenges to our business that will put pressure on earnings in 2011: A higher mix of EPA 2010 compliant engines will likely increase our product warranty. We will increase our investment in new product development. Our joint ventures will likely experience slower growth as we invest in capacity. Increasing commodity costs could continue to put downward pressure on earnings. Long-Term: We see improvements in most of our current markets and we are confident that opportunities for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future. 32 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 In millions (except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 Amount Percent Amount Percent Net sales $ 13,226 $ 10,800 $ 14,342 $ 2,426 22 % $ (3,542 ) (25 )% Cost of sales 10,058 8,631 11,402 (1,427 ) (17 )% 2,771 24 % Gross margin 3,168 2,169 2,940 999 46 % (771 ) (26 )% Operating expenses and income Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,487 1,239 1,450 (248 ) (20 )% 211 15 % Research, development and engineering expenses 414 362 422 (52 ) (14 )% 60 14 % Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 351 214 253 137 64 % (39 ) (15 )% Restructuring and other charges 99 37 99 100 % (62 ) NM Other operating (expense) income, net (16 ) (1 ) (12 ) (15 ) NM 11 92 % Operating income 1,602 682 1,272 920 NM (590 ) (46 )% Interest income 21 8 18 13 NM (10 ) (56 )% Interest expense 40 35 42 (5 ) (14 )% 7 17 % Other income (expense), net 34 (15 ) (70 ) 49 NM 55 79 % Income before income taxes 1,617 640 1,178 977 NM (538 ) (46 )% Income tax expense 477 156 360 (321 ) NM 204 57 % Consolidated net income 1,140 484 818 656 NM (334 ) (41 )% Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 100 56 63 (44 ) (79 )% 7 11 % Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. $ 1,040 $ 428 $ 755 $ 612 NM $ (327 ) (43 )% Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Cummins Inc . $ 5.28 $ 2.16 $ 3.84 $ 3.12 NM $ (1.68 ) (44 )% "NM" not meaningful information. Favorable/(Unfavorable) Percentage Points Percent of sales 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Gross margin 24.0 % 20.1 % 20.5 % 3.9 (0.4 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.2 % 11.5 % 10.1 % 0.3 (1.4 ) Research, development and engineering expenses 3.1 % 3.4 % 2.9 % 0.3 (0.5 ) 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from the recovery of emerging markets and improvement in developed markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were: Engine segment sales increased by 23 percent due to increased demand in most lines of business, led by increased demand in international industrial sales, stationary power engine sales, North American light-duty automotive sales and international medium-duty truck sales. 33 Table of Contents Power Generation segment sales increased by 21 percent due to increased sales in most lines of business led by commercial products. Components segment sales increased by 29 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission solutions, turbo technologies and filtration businesses. Distribution segment sales increased by 30 percent primarily due to the acquisition of the majority interest in an equity investee and increased sales in all geographic regions. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets were 64 percent of total net sales in 2010, compared with 52 percent of total net sales in 2009 and 59 percent of total net sales in 2008. Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margin were as follows: In millions 2010 vs. 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Volume/mix $ 469 Warranty expense 145 Price 136 Material costs 109 Acquisitions 63 Currency 62 Brazil tax recovery 32 Other (17 ) Total $ 999 Gross margin increased by $999 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 3.9 percentage points. The significant improvement was led by higher volumes, decreases in warranty expense, increased pricing and favorable material costs. The warranty provision on sales issued in 2010 as a percentage of sales was 3.0 percent compared to 3.3 percent in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to engine mix. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. In the third quarter of 2010, it was determined that we overpaid a Brazilian revenue based tax on imported products during the period 2004-2008. Our results include a pre-tax recovery of $32 million in cost of sales ($21 million after-tax) related to tax credits arising from an overpayment. This recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes in support of the business and an increase of $151 million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010 performance increased $93 million over variable compensation related to 2009 performance. Salaries and fringe benefits increased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009 that were partially offset by increased employment in 2010. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 11.2 percent in 2010 from 11.5 percent in 2009. 34 Table of Contents Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $35 million in compensation and related expenses and a decrease of $24 million in reimbursements. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2010 performance increased $20 million over variable compensation related to 2009 performance. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased slightly to 3.1 percent in 2010 from 3.4 percent in 2009. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased primarily due to the following: In millions 2010 vs. 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) $ 66 Komatsu manufacturing alliances 13 Royalty and interest income 12 These overall increases were primarily due to higher demand as a result of economic recovery in emerging markets. Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Amortization of intangible assets $ (15 ) $ (7 ) Loss on sale of fixed assets (4 ) (8 ) Royalty expense (3 ) (7 ) Flood damage (loss) gain(1) (2 ) 12 Royalty income 10 8 Other, net (2 ) 1 Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (16 ) $ (1 ) (1) In 2009, the flood gain represents flood insurance proceeds received which more than offset flood related expenses recognized in 2009 and 2008. Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher investment balances in 2010 compared to 2009. Interest Expense Interest expense increased primarily due to higher borrowings in 2010 compared to 2009. 35 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense) was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2010 2009 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(1) $ 12 $ (4 ) Gain on acquisition of Cummins Western Canada (CWC) 12 Dividend income 7 5 Life insurance proceeds 7 Foreign currency losses, net(2) (1 ) (20 ) Bank charges (15 ) (14 ) Other, net 12 18 Total other income (expense), net $ 34 $ (15 ) (1) The change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance for the years ended December 31, 2010, was due to improved market performance. The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance for the year ended December 31, 2009, was due to market deterioration. (2) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations; primarily in the British Pound and Brazilian Real. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 29.5 percent compared to 24.4 percent for 2009. Our 2010 income tax provision also includes a $17 million (1.1 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. During 2010, we also released $3 million (0.2 percent) of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a $29 million (4.5 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. In 2009, we released $19 million of deferred tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of $10 million related to prior period matters. We expect our 2011 effective tax rate to be 30 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased primarily due to higher income of $18 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on various exchanges in India and a $15 million increase in income from Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd., reflecting the economic recovery in emerging markets. 36 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in emerging markets and certain developed countries, significantly improved gross margins, increased equity income and restructuring charges incurred in 2009 that were not repeated in 2010. These were partially offset by higher income tax expense, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Diluted earnings per share also benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Sales decreased in all segments primarily due to lower demand as a result of the global economic downturn. The primary drivers were: Engine segment sales declined by 27 percent primarily due to industrial sales decreasing by 40 percent and on-highway sales decreasing by 16 percent. Power Generation segment sales declined by 31 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the commercial products line of business. Components segment sales declined by 25 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the filtration and turbo technologies businesses. Distribution segment sales declined by 18 percent. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margin were as follows: In millions 2009 vs. 2008 Increase (Decrease) Volume/mix $ (1,228 ) Price 252 Production costs 132 Warranty expense 46 Material costs 13 Currency 8 Other 6 Total $ (771 ) Gross margin decreased by $771 million, and as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.4 percentage points. The decrease was led by lower volumes which were partially offset by increased engine purchases ahead of the January 1, 2010, emission standards change, improved pricing and decreased production costs. The overall decrease in volumes was due to lower sales resulting from the global economic downturn. Our warranty provision on sales in 2009 was 3.3 percent compared to 2.9 percent in 2008. Our 2008 warranty expense included $117 million recorded in the fourth quarter associated with increases in the estimated warranty liability primarily for certain mid-range engine products launched in 2007. The accrual rates in 2009 for these related engine products were higher than those recorded in 2008 before this change in estimate. As such, our warranty as a percentage of sales for 37 Table of Contents these engine families is higher on products sold in 2009 than it was in 2008. Overall, our relative product mix also impacted the rate as a percentage of sales when comparing these two periods. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $74 million in discretionary spending, in order to conserve cash, and a decrease of $71 million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Salaries and fringe benefits decreased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 11.5 percent in 2009 from 10.1 percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses decreased primarily due to a lower number of engineering projects to conserve cash while focusing on the development of critical technologies, new products and increased reimbursements from third parties for engineering projects. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 3.4 percent in 2009 from 2.9 percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following changes in equity income: In millions 2009 vs. 2008 Increase/(Decrease) Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) $ (22 ) Cummins MerCruiser Diesel, LLC (MerCruiser) (13 ) These decreases were primarily due to lower demand as a result of the global economic conditions. The effects of the global economic downturn were partially offset by modest increases in some markets. 38 Table of Contents Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Flood damage gain (loss)(1) $ 12 $ (5 ) Royalty income 8 12 Royalty expense (7 ) (10 ) Amortization of other intangibles (7 ) (13 ) (Loss) gain on sale of fixed assets (8 ) 5 Other, net 1 (1 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (1 ) $ (12 ) (1) The flood gain represents flood insurance proceeds received during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 which more than offset flood related expenses recognized in 2009 and 2008. Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to declining short-term interest rates. Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Foreign currency loss(1) $ (20 ) $ (46 ) Bank charges (14 ) (12 ) Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(2) (4 ) (36 ) Dividend income 5 6 Other, net 18 18 Total other (expense) income, net $ (15 ) $ (70 ) (1) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 and 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations, especially with the British Pound and Brazilian Real in 2009 and the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Indian Rupee in 2008. (2) The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance in 2008 was due to market deterioration, which included the write down of certain investments to zero. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 39 Table of Contents 2009 was 24.4 percent compared to 30.6 percent for 2008. The decrease is due to tax on foreign earnings, which are subject to lower tax rates, and an increase in research tax credits. Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a $29 million (4.5 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. In 2009, we released $19 million (3.0 percent) of deferred tax liabilities on foreign earnings, now considered to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of $10 million (1.5 percent) related to prior period matters. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to lower income of $8 million at Cummins India Limited, a publicly traded company at various exchanges in India, as a result of the decline in demand due to the global economic downturn. There were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decreased primarily due to significantly lower volumes, restructuring and other charges and decreased equity income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES 2009 Restructuring Actions In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee actions at many of our manufacturing locations, including approximately 3,200 hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring costs were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded. In response to closures and downsizing noted above, we incurred $2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5 million of restructuring expenses for asset impairments. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85 million, comprising $90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the $3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2 million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in "Restructuring and other charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Income . 40 Table of Contents These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December 31, 2009 Workforce reductions $ 81 Exit activities 7 Other 2 Changes in estimate (5 ) Total restructuring charges 85 Curtailment loss 14 Total restructuring and other charges $ 99 In addition, as a result of the restructuring actions described above, we also recorded a $14 million curtailment loss in our pension and other postretirement plans. See Note 11, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. At December 31, 2010, of the approximately 4,200 employees affected by this plan, substantially all terminations were complete. We do not include restructuring charges in our operating segment results. The pre-tax impact of allocating restructuring charges to the segment results would have been as follows: In millions Year ended December 31, 2009 Engine $ 47 Power Generation 12 Components 35 Distribution 5 Total restructuring and other charges $ 99 The following table summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring charges by expense type and the changes in the accrued amounts for the applicable periods. The restructuring related accruals were recorded in "Other accrued expenses" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets .

These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a 41 Table of Contents reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2009. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 4.5 percent. We offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the U.S. based on a clearly defined set of criteria. We also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800 hourly employees, the majority of which received severance benefits. The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services. The voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees. The remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008, included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations. During 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately $37 million. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. At December 31, 2008, of the approximately 1,450 employees affected by this plan, 1,250 had been terminated. All terminations were substantially complete as of December 31, 2009. We do not include restructuring charges in the segment results. The pre-tax impact of allocating restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2008, would have been as follows: In millions Year ended December 31, 2008 Engine $ 17 Power Generation 3 Components 15 Distribution 2 Total restructuring charges $ 37 The following table summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring expenses for 2008 actions, which were included in the balance of "Other accrued expenses" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: In millions Severance Costs 2008 Restructuring charges $ 37 Cash payments for 2008 actions (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 34 2009 Cash payments for 2008 actions (31 ) Change in estimate (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 42 Table of Contents OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, restructuring and other charges, flood damage gains or losses, or income taxes to individual segments. In 2010, non-segment items also included a Brazil revenue tax recovery that was not allocated to the businesses as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. 43 Table of Contents Following is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments.

The following are the primary drivers by market. Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 154 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure investment in emerging markets and a 123 percent improvement in units sold in the international mining markets due to increased coal and commodity demands. Stationary power engine sales increased primarily due to higher demand in power generation markets, particularly for high-horse power engines. Light-duty automotive sales increased significantly due to a 77 percent improvement in units sold to Chrysler as the result of shut-downs in 2009 as part of its reorganization efforts. Medium-duty truck engine sales increased due to a 78 percent increase in international units sold, primarily due to higher demand in the Brazilian truck market driven by a growing economy and government incentives. These increases were partially offset by a decline in heavy-duty truck engine sales. Consistent with prior emission standards changes, North American (includes the U.S and Canada and excludes Mexico) unit sales declined 61 percent due to higher engine purchases by OEMs in late 2009, ahead of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)'s 2010 emission standards change, as part of the OEM's transition plan. Total on-highway-related sales for 2010 were 50 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 61 percent in 2009. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2009, primarily due to higher gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 539 53 % 3.8 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 107 NM 1.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses (88 ) (16 )% 0.5 Research, development and engineering expenses (22 ) (9 )% 0.5 The increase in gross margin versus 2009, was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization, decreased warranty expense and cost structure improvements from actions taken in late 2008 and early 2009, partially offset by an unfavorable mix. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased in most unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase was led by higher demand in emerging markets, especially at DCEC and Komatsu-Cummins Engine Company (KCEC). The increase 45 Table of Contents in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation which resulted from the segment's strong performance. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales Engine segment sales experienced deterioration across all major markets, versus 2008, as a result of the global economic downturn. The following are the primary drivers by market. Industrial market sales decreased due to deterioration in units sold in the construction, marine and mining markets by 63 percent, 45 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Stationary power market sales declined due to decreased sales to the Power Generation segment as it used existing inventory to meet declining customer demand. Medium-duty truck engine sales decreased significantly due to a 35 percent decline in international truck units sold as a result of the global economic downturn. The U.S. market was impacted by the economic downturn; however, this was partially offset by increased sales ahead of the January 1, 2010, emission standards change and improving market share. Heavy-duty truck engine sales declined as international units sold were down 64 percent. We experienced a decline in Mexican heavy-duty sales due to an increase in heavy-duty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the increased activity ahead of Mexico's July 1, 2008, new emission requirements, appreciation of the U.S. dollar and an influx of used trucks into the market from the U.S. and Canada permitted under a new law. Although U.S. truck fleets experienced financial challenges due to a lack of freight and limited access to credit, our U.S. heavy-duty engine sales ended the year flat as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the January 1, 2010, emission standards change and improving market share. Total on-highway-related sales were 61 percent of total Engine segment sales, compared to 53 percent in 2008. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased versus 2008, primarily due to lower gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and decreased research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (330 ) (24 )% 0.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 57 9 % (1.7 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 45 16 % (0.6 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (45 ) (45 )% NM The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower engine volumes in most markets as a result of the global economic downturn, which was partially offset by increased sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the January 1, 2010, emission standards change, price improvements and by cost reduction activities at our manufacturing plants. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased due to significantly lower demand at DCEC, KCEC and Cummins MerCruiser 46 Table of Contents Diesel Marine LLC. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, higher recovery of engineering expenses from third parties and decreased payroll costs as the result of restructuring actions.

The following are the primary drivers by business. Commercial products sales increased due to higher demand in the U.K., Latin America, India, and East Asia which was partially offset by decreased demand in North America. Consumer sales increased primarily due to signs of recovery in the North American RV market. Commercial projects sales increased due to higher demand in the South Pacific and Africa, partially offset by reduced demand in the Middle East. 47 Table of Contents Generator technologies sales increased due to higher demand in East Asia, the U.K. and India, partially offset by a decline in demand in North America, East Europe and the Middle East. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT increased versus 2009, primarily due to higher gross margins and equity, royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses.

The increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense which resulted from the strong improvement over 2009. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased due to higher demand, especially at Cummins Olayan Energy and CCEC. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales Power Generation segment sales decreased in most businesses, versus 2008, as the result of the global economic downturn. The following are the primary drivers by business. Commercial products sales decreased due to lower demand across most regions, especially in North America, the U.K., the Middle East, Latin America and India. Generator technologies sales decreased due to lower OEM demand in Western Europe, North America and India. Commercial projects sales decreased due to lower demand in most regions, especially in North America, Western Europe and the U.K. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT decreased primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development 48 Table of Contents and engineering expenses.

For the year ended 2009, the sales for the portion of the business included in emission solutions were $86 million. Sales for the portion of the business included in filtration for the year ended 2008 was $136 million. The 2008 balances were not reclassified. 2010 vs. 2009 Sales Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2009. The following are the primary regional drivers by business. Emission solutions business sales increased due to higher technology content and increased sales of North American EPA 2010 aftertreatment systems and higher European demand for aftertreatment systems for the first fit market, which was partially offset by decreased sales of our EPA 2007 aftertreatment systems. Turbo technologies business sales increased due to improved original equipment demand in Europe and China and significant global aftermarket recovery. Filtration business sales increased in all regions primarily due to global aftermarket recovery and improved global original equipment sales. Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved OEM first fit sales in China and the aftermarket recovery in North America, which was partially offset by decreased first fit sales in North America. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT almost tripled versus 2009, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, 50 Table of Contents development and engineering expenses.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to increased variable compensation which resulted from the segment's strong performance; other people costs and new product development program spending. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales Components segment sales decreased in all businesses versus 2008, as the result of the global economic downturn. The following are the primary drivers by business. Filtration business sales decreased significantly due to falling global aftermarket and OEM demand, especially in North America and Europe, and the transfer of a portion of the business to emission solutions in 2009. Turbo technologies business sales decreased significantly due to falling OEM demand in Europe and North America. Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to falling OEM demand in North America and Europe. Emission solutions business sales decreased due to falling OEM demand across Europe and North America. These decreases were partially offset by the transfer of a portion of the filtration business into emission solutions in 2009. 51 Table of Contents Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2008, primarily due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses.

Sales Distribution sales, excluding the acquisition, decreased versus 2008, primarily due to the decline in power generation equipment and engine sales as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Decreased sales were led by lower sales volumes primarily in Power Generation and Engines and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Segment EBIT Distribution EBIT decreased primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Including acquisition Gross margin $ (86 ) (18 )% (0.2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 54 16 % (0.3 ) Excluding acquisition (1) Gross margin (94 ) (20 )% (0.2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 56 17 % (0.5 ) (1) Primarily represents the acquisition of one distributor in 2009. The 2008 data does not exclude acquisitions which occurred in 2008. 54 Table of Contents The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, lower sales volumes and decreased discretionary spending. Reconciliation of Segment EBIT to Income Before Income Taxes The table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, unallocated corporate expenses include $32 million in Brazil tax recoveries ($21 million after-tax) and $2 million in flood damage expenses. The Brazil tax recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, unallocated corporate expenses included $99 million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of $12 million related to flood damage recoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2008, unallocated corporate expenses included $37 million of restructuring charges, a $36 million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and $5 million of losses related to flood damage recoveries. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit as we terminated our three year credit facility a year early and entered into a new four year credit facility during 2010. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, other sources of liquidity include: Cash and cash equivalents of $1,023 million, of which approximately 33 percent is located in the U.S. and 67 percent is located in the United Kingdom (U.K.), China, Singapore, Brazil and India, Marketable securities of $339 million, which are located primarily in India and Brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days, Revolving credit facility with $1.21 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit, International and other domestic credit facilities with $278 million available and 55 Table of Contents Accounts receivable sales program with $122 million available, based on eligible receivables. We believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock repurchases and debt service obligations. On July 16, 2010, we entered into a new four year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders which provides us with a $1.24 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for the general corporate purposes of Cummins. See Note 9, "DEBT" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The credit agreement includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters should not exceed 3.0 to 1. At December 31, 2010, our leverage using this measure was 0.46 to 1. The required interest coverage ratio, which is consolidated EBITDA minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense, in each case for the four consecutive fiscal quarters, should not be less than 1.50 to 1. At December 31, 2010, our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 36.68 to 1. We continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the European debt crisis. No sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts, while any equities held are with large, well-diversified multinational firms or are de minimus amounts in large index funds. In addition, we have rebalanced our asset portfolio's in the U.S. and U.K. with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios. Our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets. A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. More than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at December 31, 2010, are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available, without legal restrictions, to fund ordinary business operations at the local level. We have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so. The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $8 million to $116 million over each of the next five years. Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month 56 Table of Contents depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

Current liabilities increased 34 percent primarily due to an increase of 45 percent in accounts and loans payable which was the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volume in the businesses and the acquisition of the majority interest in CWC. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased $93 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a $504 million increase in cash and cash equivalents during the comparable period in 2009. The change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows: 57 Table of Contents Operating Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 In millions 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated net income $ 1,140 $ 484 $ 818 $ 656 $ (334 ) Restructuring and other charges, net of cash payments 16 34 (16 ) (18 ) Depreciation and amortization 320 326 314 (6 ) 12 (Gain) loss on investments (18 ) 45 (18 ) (45 ) Gain on fair value adjustment for consolidated investee (12 ) (12 ) Deferred income taxes 56 5 (1 ) 51 6 Equity in income of investees, net of dividends (147 ) 23 (45 ) (170 ) 68 Pension contributions in excess of expense (151 ) (36 ) (31 ) (115 ) (5 ) Other post-retirement benefits payments in excess of expense (35 ) (24 ) (35 ) (11 ) 11 Stock-based compensation expense 22 20 28 2 (8 ) Excess tax (benefits) deficiencies on stock based awards (10 ) 1 (13 ) (11 ) 14 Translation and hedging activities 13 41 (10 ) (28 ) 51 Changes in: Accounts and notes receivable (195 ) (181 ) 88 (14 ) (269 ) Inventories (574 ) 482 (251 ) (1,056 ) 733 Other current assets (54 ) 33 (54 ) (87 ) 87 Accounts payable 345 (75 ) (174 ) 420 99 Accrued expenses 233 (132 ) 124 365 (256 ) Changes in other liabilities and deferred revenue 133 155 109 (22 ) 46 Other, net (60 ) (1 ) 41 (59 ) (42 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,006 $ 1,137 $ 987 $ (131 ) $ 150 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2009, primarily due to significantly higher inventory levels to meet anticipated demand, increased equity in income of investees net of dividends and higher pension contributions made in the year. This was partially offset by significantly higher consolidated net income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volumes. Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets and market interest rate levels. We made $221 million of pension contributions in 2010 (including voluntary contributions of $108 million). These contributions include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. We expect to contribute $130 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2011. 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2008, primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations, principally inventories, as a result of management's response to the challenging global economy and increased dividends from our equity investees which were partially offset by 58 Table of Contents decreased income as the result of declining sales. Management's priorities included reducing inventory, aligning our cost and capacity with the real demand for our products and managing the business to generate positive cash flows by improving our working capital.

Capital expenditures were $364 million compared to $310 million in the comparable period in 2009. We continue to invest in the development of new products and we plan to spend approximately $600 million to $650 million in 2011 as we continue with product launches, facility improvements and prepare for future on-highway emission standards and product launches. 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2008, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures and lower investments in the acquisition of businesses which were partially offset by increased net cash paid for investments in marketable securities and lower cash proceeds from the sale of a business. These decreases primarily occurred as a result of management's decision to conserve cash and maintain liquidity during the recession. Capital expenditures decreased as management tightened capital spending substantially across all business by limiting expenditures to critical projects and investments in development of new products. 59 Table of Contents Financing Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 In millions 2010 2009 2008 Proceeds from borrowings $ 214 $ 76 $ 76 $ 138 $ Payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations (143 ) (97 ) (152 ) (46 ) 55 Net borrowings (payments) under short-term credit agreements 9 (2 ) 33 11 (35 ) Distributions to noncontrolling interests (28 ) (34 ) (24 ) 6 (10 ) Dividend payments on common stock (172 ) (141 ) (122 ) (31 ) (19 ) Proceeds from sale of common stock held by employee benefit trust 58 72 63 (14 ) 9 Repurchases of common stock (241 ) (20 ) (128 ) (221 ) 108 Excess tax benefits (deficiencies) on stock-based awards 10 (1 ) 13 11 (14 ) Other, net 26 6 4 20 2 Net cash used in financing activities $ (267 ) $ (141 ) $ (237 ) $ (126 ) $ 96 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2009, primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock, which was partially offset by higher proceeds from borrowings primarily related to the acquisition of CWC and borrowings in Brazil. Our total debt was $843 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $703 million as of December 31, 2009. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010, compared with 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009. The increase in total debt was principally due to acquisitions and borrowings in Brazil which were subsequently invested in marketable securities. 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash used in financing activities declined versus 2008, primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock and lower payments on borrowings, which was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments. Our total debt was $703 million as of December 31, 2009, compared with $698 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009, compared to 16.7 percent at December 31, 2008. Repurchase of Common Stock In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of Cummins common stock. We began making purchases under the plan in March 2008 and purchased $128 million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of $55.49 per share. In February 2009, we temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we lifted the suspension and purchased $20 million of common stock at an average cost of $46.52 per common share. 60 Table of Contents In 2010, we purchased $241 million of common stock through the following quarterly purchases: In millions (except per share amounts) For each quarter ended Shares Purchased Average Cost Per Share March 28 0.7 $ 60.36 June 27 1.8 67.39 September 26 1.0 75.77 December 31 Total 3.5 $ 68.57 In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of Cummins common stock upon the completion of the $500 million program. We purchased $111 million of our common stock in February 2011 and completed the $500 million program as of this filing date. Quarterly Dividends In July 2010, our Board of Directors approved a 50 percent increase in the quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.175 per common share to $0.2625 per common share. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved a 40 percent increase in the quarterly dividends on our common stock from $0.125 per common share to $0.175 per common share. Cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2010 2009 2008 First quarter $ 0.175 $ 0.175 $ 0.125 Second quarter 0.175 0.175 0.125 Third quarter 0.2625 0.175 0.175 Fourth quarter 0.2625 0.175 0.175 Total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $172 million, $141 million and $122 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider the dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations. Credit Ratings A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility, have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2010 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications. In January 2011, Fitch affirmed our ratings and upgraded our outlook to positive. In September 2010, Standard and Poor's raised our senior unsecured debt ratings to BBB+ and changed our outlook to stable. In July 2010, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. raised our senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa2. 61 Table of Contents Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below.

In February of 2009, we renegotiated our sale and leaseback transaction to extend the term for an additional two years and removed the requirement to provide residual insurance. The lease obligations are included in this line item. See Note 13, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our sale and leaseback transaction. (2) We are contractually obligated in the U.K. to fund $16 million in 2011; however, our expected total pension contributions for 2011 is approximately $130 million. After 2011, our contractual agreement in the U.K. is $62 million per year through 2015. The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $85 million as of December 31, 2010. We are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. See Note 6, "INCOME TAXES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 62 Table of Contents Our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010, are as follows: Other Commercial Commitments 2011 2012 - 2013 2014 - 2015 After 2015 Total In millions Standby letters of credit under revolving credit agreement $ 31 $ 1 $ $ $ 32 International and other domestic letters of credit 25 3 2 30 Performance and excise bonds 18 7 52 1 78 Guarantees, indemnifications and other commitments 2 28 47 77 Total $ 76 $ 11 $ 80 $ 50 $ 217 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Financing Arrangements for Affiliated Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase and/or sell products and components from/to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," of our Consolidated Financial Statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, recoverability of investment related to new products, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall 63 Table of Contents programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 10, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2010 and 2009 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products At December 31, 2010, we have capitalized $218 million associated with the future launch of our light-duty diesel engine product. Development of this product began in 2006. Market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs. At December 31, 2009, we reviewed our investment of $216 million for possible impairment. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down is appropriate. These projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable. Customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the light-duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through 2010 and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2010, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $511 million. These assets included $139 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $50 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and 64 Table of Contents credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 6, "INCOME TAXES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5-year average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2010, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 8.4 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2010 one year return exceeded 15 percent, combined with the very favorable returns in 2009 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.0 percent per year in 2011 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of December 31, 2010, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 6.5 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 9.3 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The one year return for our UK plan was 13 percent for 2010 and similar to our US plan, the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return 65 Table of Contents assumption of 7.0 percent in 2011 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and target allocation for 2011 are as follows: U.S. Plans U.K. Plans Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Target Allocation 2011 Target Allocation 2011 Investment description 2010 2009 2010 2009 Equity securities 45.0 % 46.8 % 59.4 % 55.0 % 57.0 % 58.5 % Fixed income 40.0 % 41.2 % 32.6 % 40.0 % 40.0 % 38.2 % Real estate/other 15.0 % 12.0 % 8.0 % 5.0 % 3.0 % 3.3 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2008-2010 and our expected rate for 2011. Long-Term Expected Return Assumptions 2011 2010 2009 2008 U.S. Plans 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.25 % 8.25 % Non-U.S. Plans 7.00 % 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.25 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2010, we had net pension actuarial losses of $692 million and $227 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Decreases in actuarial losses increased our shareholders' equity by $125 million (after-tax) in 2010. The decreases resulted from improved plan asset performance in 2010. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2008 through 2010 and our expected expense for 2011. Net Periodic Pension Expense In millions 2011 2010 2009 2008 Pension expense $ 67 $ 70 $ 93 $ 71 We expect 2011 pension expense to be slightly under 2010, due to strong returns and higher assets, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2010, was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover, strong contributions in 2009 and the absence of any curtailment charges. The increase in periodic pension expense in 2009 was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The 66 Table of Contents weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2011 2010 2009 2008 U.S. Plans 5.42 % 5.60 % 6.20 % 6.10 % Non-U.S. Plans 5.80 % 5.80 % 6.20 % 5.80 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's, Standard & Poors, Fitch and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of December 31, 2010. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits. Our model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the U.S. plans and 60 years of payments for the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2011 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In millions Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25 percent increase $ (4 ) 0.25 percent decrease 3 Expected rate of return on assets: 1 percent increase (30 ) 1 percent decrease 29 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Note 11, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . 67 Table of Contents Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under GAAP for goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. In accordance with GAAP, our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing: Within our Components segment, emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit. This reporting unit accounts for almost 90 percent of our total goodwill balance at December 31, 2010. Also within our Components segment, our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit. Within our Power Generation segment, our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit. Within our Engine segment, our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components. Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services. No other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount. As of the end of the third quarter in 2010, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by GAAP and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2010, our recorded goodwill was $367 million, approximately 90 percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill. 68 Table of Contents RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In July 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its standards regarding the disclosures for credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses. The objective of the amendment is to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables, the allowance for credit losses, and timely recognition of such losses. Specifically, the amendment requires an entity to disclose credit quality indicators, past due information and modifications of its financing receivables. The new rules are effective for us beginning December 31, 2010. Our level of receivables that qualify as financing receivables, as defined by the standard, are not material for disclosure. In January 2010, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures, which are effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures about certain Level 3 activity which will not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The new standard requires us to disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The new standard also requires a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques of the fair value measurements. Our disclosures related to the new standard are included in Note 4, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In June 2009, the FASB amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity from GAAP. The new standard modifies the financial components approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferor's continuing involvement with transferred assets. The new standard requires us to report any activity under our receivable sales program as secured borrowings. As of December 31, 2010, there were no outstanding amounts under our receivable sales program and there was no significant activity during the year. In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. The only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to deconsolidate Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) as of January 1, 2010 and to account for CKEC under GAAP for equity method investees. CKEC is an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner. Prior to January 1, 2010, we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this VIE due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the VIE. The impact of the deconsolidation on our Consolidated Statements of Income was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past. The most significant impacts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were to decrease current assets by $9 million, decrease long-term assets by $10 million, increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by $11 million and decrease noncontrolling interest by $11 million. 69 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically, this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules are effective for us beginning January 1, 2011. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements .
