EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related products, including filtration and emissions solutions, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including DaimlerChryslerAG (DaimlerChrysler), PACCAR Inc., International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar International Corporation), Volvo AB, CNH Global N.V., Tata Motors Ltd., Ford, Volkswagen, Dongfeng Motor Company, Komatsu and Scania AB. We serve our customers through a network of more than 550 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,000 dealer locations in more than 160 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses 28 and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail, and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems selling engines, generator sets and alternators and providing rental of power equipment for both standby and prime power uses. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels. OEM inventory levels, production schedules and work stoppages also impact our sales. Economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reduced sales, which affect our profits and cash flow. We are also subject to substantial government regulation which requires us to make significant investments in capital and research that also impacts our profits and cash flow. We continued our strong performances of the past two years into 2006 with a third straight year of record net sales and net earnings. Net earnings were $715 million, or $14.21 per diluted share, on sales of $11.4 billion, compared to 2005 net earnings of $550 million, or $11.01 per diluted share, on sales of $9.9 billion. The earnings improvement was driven by a 15 percent increase in net sales and a 19 percent increase in gross margin, as we continue to benefit from improved economic conditions resulting in high levels of demand across our businesses, as well as increased share in a number of markets and our focus on cost reduction. All of our segments reported sales increases for the year compared to a year ago, with particularly strong demand in the heavy-duty truck market and the Power Generation commercial market, where sales increased 17 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Overall, our Engine segment net sales were up $854 million, or 13 percent. In addition, net sales increased at our Power Generation segment (up $417 million, or 21 percent), Components segment (up $281 million, or 14 percent) and Distribution segment (up $194 million, or 16 percent) year-over-year. Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Millions, except earnings per share Consolidated Results Net sales $ 11,362 $ 9,918 $ 8,438 Gross margin 2,595 2,186 1,680 Investee equity, royalty and other income 140 131 120 Operating earnings 1,131 894 539 Net earnings 715 550 350 Diluted earnings per share $ 14.21 $ 11.01 $ 7.39 During 2006, we continued our commitment to building a strong balance sheet, investing in profitable growth around the globe and returning value to our shareholders. Some of the transactions and events that highlight this are as follows: Business Expansion In January 2006, we signed a joint venture agreement with KAMAZ Inc., the largest vehicle manufacturer in Russia, to produce B Series engines under the name ZAO Cummins Kama. The joint venture will build on the Cummins and KAMAZ relationship that dates back to the early 1980s. Among the customers of the new company are KAMAZ for trucks and buses, as well as 29 other manufacturers in Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine that produce trucks, buses and agricultural equipment. After announcing a feasibility study in the spring, we signed an agreement in October 2006 with Beiqi Foton Motor Company (Beiqi Foton) to form a 50/50 joint venture, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Company (BFCEC), to produce two families of Cummins light-duty, high performance diesel engines in Beijing. The engines will be used in light-duty commercial trucks, pickup trucks, multipurpose and sport utility vehicles. Certain types of marine, small construction equipment and industrial applications will also be served by this engine family. Cummins and Beiqi Foton will initially invest a combined $126 million into BFCEC, which is scheduled to begin production in 2008. The parties are awaiting approval of the joint venture by the Chinese government. In July 2006, we announced that we had reached agreement with a major automotive manufacturer serving the North American market to produce and market a light-duty, diesel-powered engine. In October 2006, we announced that we would use an existing facility for production of this new engine platform and that DaimlerChrysler was our significant customer. As a part of the agreement, we will develop and manufacture a family of high-performance, light-duty diesel engines for a variety of on-highway applications in vehicles below 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight, including standard pickup trucks, like the Dodge Ram 1500, and sport utility vehicles, as well as industrial applications. The first vehicles with this engine are expected to be ready for market by the end of the decade. In August 2006, our first technical center in China was opened in Wuhan City. The East Asia Technical Center, a 55/45 consolidated joint venture between Cummins and Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company Limited (DCEC), will provide engineering and technical development services for the full range of Cummins products built in China, including diesel and natural gas engines, power generators, turbochargers and filtration products. A series of projects has already started in the technical center, including the development of a new 13-liter engine platform for the heavy-duty truck market served by DCEC. Business Divestiture On September 22, 2006, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our SEG GmbH subsidiary (SEG) based in Kempen, Germany to Woodward Governor Company. The sale closed in the fourth quarter for approximately $35 million and resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $9 million. SEG, which is a part of our Power Generation segment, specializes in the design and manufacturing of measurement, control and protection products for power generation systems with an emphasis on the wind power generation segment. Total assets of SEG were approximately $42 million at the date of the transaction and $39 million at December 31, 2005, which is less than 1 percent of our total assets at those dates. Total sales of SEG were approximately $51 million and $72 million, for the ten months ended October 31, 2006 and for the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively, which is less than 1 percent of our total net sales for these periods. Financing Matters On May 8, 2006, the Board of Directors approved our plan to redeem all of the 7% convertible quarterly income preferred securities that were issued in June 2001. On May 9, 2006, we gave the trustee our formal irrevocable notification of our intent to redeem the preferred securities. As a result, substantially all of the related $300 million of 7% convertible subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into shares of our common stock. During the second quarter of 2006, we completed our previously announced $100 million share repurchase program. In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to two million shares of Cummins common stock in addition to what has been acquired under previous 30 authorizations. During the third and fourth quarters, we purchased 500,000 shares for approximately $59 million. In addition, the Board also voted in July to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 20 percent to $0.36 per share. Our level of debt at December 31, 2006, has decreased by $556 million since December 31, 2005 and our debt-to-capital ratio has improved to 22.4 percent at December 31, 2006, from 42.3 percent at December 31, 2005. As previously announced, we repaid our $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006, the first call date for the debt. The notes were issued in 2002 and were repaid using cash generated from operations. We incurred additional costs of approximately $12 million associated with the early extinguishment of this debt, which is recorded in Other (income) expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings . During 2006 we made contributions of approximately $266 million to our pension plans. As of the end of 2006, our global pension funding was approximately 88.5 percent of our obligation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2006 vs. 2005 Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Millions Net sales $ 11,362 $ 9,918 $ 1,444 15 % Cost of sales 8,767 7,732 1,035 13 % Gross margin 2,595 2,186 409 19 % Operating expenses and income Selling and administrative expenses 1,283 1,145 138 12 % Research and engineering expenses 321 278 43 15 % Investee equity, royalty and other income (140 ) (131 ) (9 ) 7 % Other operating expenses, net NM Operating earnings 1,131 894 237 27 % Interest income (47 ) (24 ) (23 ) 96 % Interest expense 96 109 (13 ) 12 % Other (income) expenses, net (1 ) 11 (12 ) NM Earnings before income taxes and minority interests 1,083 798 285 36 % Provision for income taxes 324 216 108 50 % Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 44 32 12 38 % Net earnings $ 715 $ 550 $ 165 30 % Net Sales Net sales increased in all segments. Engine sales were up $854 million, or 13 percent, due to strong demand from heavy and medium-duty truck OEMs, higher engine volumes for industrial applications and increased shipments of light-duty engines. Engine and part sales to on-highway markets were 12 percent higher compared to last year with increased volumes in most market segments. Power Generation sales increased $417 million, or 21 percent, due to increased demand across all product lines. Components sales increased $281 million, or 14 percent, due to increased sales within all of our Components businesses. Distribution sales increased $194 million, or 16 percent, primarily due to increased demand for power generation products followed by increased parts, service and engine volumes. See our Operating Segment Results section for further details on sales by segment. 31 Gross Margin Gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales, the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs, and changes in sales mix, all of which increased gross margin by $395 million. In addition, $94 million in price realization, net of increased product costs, improved gross margin in the current year compared to the prior year. These increases in margin were partially offset by increased warranty expenses of $53 million, primarily as a result of the increased volumes as well as increased spending of $43 million for new product introductions and ramp-up. Warranty expense as a percent of sales increased slightly to 2.8 percent in 2006 compared to 2.7 percent in 2005. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental staffing and higher compensation and related expenses of approximately $64 million, which included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits, as a result of our improved financial performance. Other factors affecting selling and administrative expenses included increased consulting fees and other outside services of $33 million, increased marketing and administrative expenses of $18 million and increased travel expenses of $16 million. The remaining change in selling and administrative expenses is due to a combination of increases in various other miscellaneous expenses, none of which were significant individually, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact. Overall selling and administrative expenses were 11.3 percent of sales in 2006 compared to 11.5 percent of sales in 2005. Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and outside services, as well as higher spending on development programs for future products. We had significant research and engineering expenses across the Engine and Components segments related to new product development for 2007 and beyond as well as research and engineering expenses for growth platforms across geographies. The Engine segment accounted for $24 million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with an increase in the Components segment of $12 million. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Investee Equity, Royalty and Other Income Investee equity, royalty and other income increased slightly primarily due to an increase in earnings at several of our equity investees, led by an $18 million increase in earnings from our North American distributors, a $6 million increase in earnings from Tata Cummins Ltd. and a $3 million increase in earnings from CCEC. These increases were partially offset, by a $17 million decrease in earnings from Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC), as a result of weakness in the medium-duty truck market, due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of China truck industry. Other Operating Expenses, Net The major components of other operating expense are royalty income, amortization of intangible assets and gain or loss on sale of fixed assets. The 2006 results include a $9 million gain on the sale of SEG and a legal settlement of approximately $3 million. In addition, royalty income decreased by approximately $4 million in 2006. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous operating expenses and income, none of which were material, resulted in an additional $2 million of other operating expense. 32 Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2006 compared to 2005. The higher average cash balances are due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in 2006. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt balances in 2006 as compared to 2005. The conversion of our $300 million 7% convertible subordinated debentures during the second quarter resulted in a reduction in interest expense of over $10 million for 2006. Other (Income) Expenses, Net The major components of other (income) expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses, bank charges and other miscellaneous income and expenses. The fluctuation in other income in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange gains and losses from a loss of approximately $6 million in 2005 to a gain of approximately $11 million in 2006. Partially offsetting the fluctuation in foreign currency gains and losses was a $12 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred when we repaid our $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006. In addition, there were several fluctuations in the components of miscellaneous other income and expenses, none of which were individually significant. Provision for Income Taxes Our tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings, export tax benefits and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2006 was 29.9 percent. Our income tax provision for 2006 was impacted by a $12 million, or $0.23 per share, increase in the first quarter for the effect of new Indiana tax legislation, and a $28 million, or $0.55 per share, reduction in the second quarter due to the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years and by a $10 million, or $0.20 per share, reduction in the fourth quarter due to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. Our effective tax rate for 2005 was 27.1 percent. Our 2005 provision was reduced by $16 million for the tax benefits of foreign dividend distributions which qualified for a special 85 percent deduction under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and by $8 million due to the favorable resolution in the fourth quarter of 2005 of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute. We expect our 2007 effective tax rate to be 33 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. The Jobs Act phases out the export tax benefits (reduced 20 percent for 2005, 40 percent for 2006 and repealed thereafter) that have been a key factor in our low tax rate. Export benefits are replaced with a new U.S. manufacturer tax deduction which began phasing in starting in 2005. However, we do not expect the manufacturer deduction to produce a comparable level of benefits. Minority Interests in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interest is primarily attributable to Cummins India Ltd. (CIL), a 51 percent owned subsidiary, Cummins Eastern Canada LLP (CEC), a 51 percent owned subsidiary, and Wuxi Holset Engineering Co. Ltd. (Wuxi), a 55 percent owned subsidiary. These three subsidiaries account for over 90 percent of the total minority interest in 2006. Earnings at these three subsidiaries increased this year resulting in a combined increase in minority interest of $7 million for 2006 compared to 2005. In addition, earnings at SEG GmbH & Co. KG, a 51 percent owned subsidiary prior to its sale in the fourth quarter of 2006, improved resulting in a $3 million year-over-year increase in minority interests. The remainder of the consolidated partially-owned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings. 33 2005 vs. 2004 Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Millions Net sales $ 9,918 $ 8,438 $ 1,480 18 % Cost of sales 7,732 6,758 974 14 % Gross margin 2,186 1,680 506 30 % Operating expenses and income Selling and administrative expenses 1,145 1,015 130 13 % Research and engineering expenses 278 241 37 15 % Investee equity, royalty and other income (131 ) (120 ) (11 ) 9 % Other operating expenses, net 5 (5 ) 100 % Operating earnings 894 539 355 66 % Interest income (24 ) (12 ) (12 ) 100 % Interest expense 109 111 (2 ) 2 % Other expenses, net 11 8 3 38 % Earnings before income taxes and minority interests 798 432 366 85 % Provision for income taxes 216 56 160 NM Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 32 26 6 23 % Net earnings $ 550 $ 350 $ 200 57 % Net Sales Net sales increased in all segments with the primary driver being a $1,233 million, or 23 percent, increase in Engine sales due to strong demand from heavy- and medium-duty truck OEMs, higher engine volumes for industrial and stationary power applications and increased shipments of light-duty engines. Engine and part sales to on-highway markets were 20 percent higher compared to 2004 with increased volumes in all market segments. Power Generation sales increased $157 million, or 9 percent, due to increased demand for commercial generator sets, generator drives, and alternators, partially offset by a moderate decrease in rental revenue and a slight decrease in sales to the consumer market. Components sales increased $217 million, or 12 percent, primarily reflecting increased demand from first-fit OEMs and the aftermarket channel. Distribution sales increased $218 million, or 22 percent, primarily due to increased demand for engines and power generation products internationally and sales growth from distributor acquisitions. See our Operating Segment Results and Outlook section for further details on sales by segment. Gross Margin Gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales, the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs, and changes in sales mix, all of which increased gross margin by $453 million. In addition, pricing actions of $145 million in 2005 enabled us to more than offset the increased material costs of steel and other commodities of $130 million. Other factors which impacted gross margin to a lesser extent were slightly increased warranty costs, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and other miscellaneous cost reductions. As a result of the foregoing, gross margin percentage increased to 22.0 percent in 2005 from 19.9 percent in 2004. Warranty expense as a percent of sales decreased slightly to 2.7 percent in 2005 compared to 3.1 percent in 2004. 34 Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of approximately $72 million, which included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits, as a result of our improved financial performance. In addition, incremental staffing added to the increased compensation and related expenses. Shipping and handling costs increased by approximately $11 million due to increased sales volumes. Other factors increasing selling and administrative expenses to a lesser extent included marketing and administrative expenses, consulting fees and other outside services, which combined for $23 million of the increase. Overall selling and administrative expenses were 11.5 percent of sales in 2005 compared to 12.0 percent of sales in 2004. Research and Engineering Expenses Research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and outside services, as well as higher spending on prototype development programs for future products. The Engine segment accounted for $38 million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with a slight increase in the Components segment, offset by a slight decrease in the Power Generation segment. Other miscellaneous research and development expenses increased as well, however they were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Investee Equity, Royalty and Other Income Investee equity, royalty and other income increased primarily due to improved earnings from our North American distributors of $8 million and improved earnings from CCEC of $7 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased earnings from DCEC of $7 million due to reduced demand in China truck market in response to regulatory changes. Other Operating Expenses, Net The major components of other operating expenses are royalty income, amortization of intangible assets and loss on sale of fixed assets. The fluctuation from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in the loss on sale of fixed assets. Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2005 compared to 2004. The increased cash balances are due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in 2005. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased slightly due to a combination of factors. Interest expense on debt in 2005 was lower due to the repayment of long-term debt in the first quarter. The lower interest expense on debt was partially offset by increased interest expense on capital leases related to power generation equipment due to the conversion of operating leases to capital leases in late 2004. Other Expenses, Net The major components of other expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses, bank charges and other miscellaneous expenses. The increase in other expense in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in the gain on sale of marketable securities. These increases to other expense were partially offset by write-downs of investments in 2004 that did not recur in 2005. 35 Provision for Income Taxes The higher 2005 tax provision of 27.1 percent reflects the increase in earnings before taxes. Our 2005 provision was reduced by $16 million for the tax benefits of foreign dividend distributions which qualified for a special 85 percent deduction under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and by $8 million due to the favorable resolution in the fourth quarter of 2005 of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute. Excluding these unusual or nonrecurring benefits, our 2005 effective tax rate was 30.1 percent. This rate was lower than the 35 percent U.S. tax rate, primarily because of U.S. export tax benefits and research tax credits along with lower taxes on foreign earnings, especially foreign joint venture equity earnings recorded net of foreign taxes. Minority Interests in Earnings of Consolidated Subsidiaries The increase in minority interests was primarily attributable to higher earnings at Cummins Eastern Canada LLP, a 51 percent-owned subsidiary and Cummins India Limited, a 51 percent-owned subsidiary. These two subsidiaries account for over seventy percent of the total minority interest in 2005. The remainder of the increase in minority interests was attributable to a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings at the remaining consolidated subsidiaries. OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS AND OUTLOOK Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems selling engines, generator sets and alternators and providing rental of power equipment for both standby and prime power uses. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and minority interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, minimum pension liabilities or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. 36 A summary of operating results by segment for the years ended December 31, is shown below: Engine Power Generation Components Distribution Non-segment items(1) Total Millions 2006 Net sales $ 7,511 $ 2,416 $ 2,281 $ 1,385 $ (2,231 ) $ 11,362 Investee equity, royalty and other income 67 12 7 54 140 Segment EBIT 733 220 107 144 (25 ) 1,179 2005 Net sales $ 6,657 $ 1,999 $ 2,000 $ 1,191 $ (1,929 ) $ 9,918 Investee equity, royalty and other income 80 9 8 34 131 Segment EBIT 582 145 89 107 (16 ) 907 2004 Net sales $ 5,424 $ 1,842 $ 1,783 $ 973 $ (1,584 ) $ 8,438 Investee equity, royalty and other income 80 6 9 25 120 Segment EBIT 328 60 84 79 (8 ) 543 (1) Includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses. The tables below reconcile the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Millions Segment EBIT $ 1,179 $ 907 $ 543 Less: Interest expense 96 109 111 Earnings before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,083 $ 798 $ 432 We made certain leadership changes effective May 2, 2005, within our management team. In connection with these changes, certain modifications were made to our internal reporting. These modifications are summarized below: The Filtration and Other segment was renamed the Components segment and now includes operating results of the fuel systems business which were previously included in the Engine segment. Historically, the fuel systems business transferred product within the Engine segment at cost. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, those transfers now use a cost-plus based transfer price. As a result of this change, segment EBIT increased for the Components segment and decreased for the Engine segment but there was no impact to consolidated earnings. Revenues of the Components segment were also increased to reflect transfers to the Engine segment and eliminations were increased by a corresponding amount. The North American distribution business was combined with the International Distribution segment and renamed the Distribution segment. Previously, the North American distribution business was reported in the Engine and Power Generation segments as equity from investees and included the results of a partially-owned distributor that is consolidated. As a result, revenues of the Engine segment were increased to reflect sales to the consolidated distributor that were previously eliminated and decreased for the revenues of the consolidated distributor which are now included 37 in the Distribution segment. In addition, this change also caused earnings from equity investees in the Engine and Power Generation segments to decrease while earnings from equity investees in the Distribution segment increased by a corresponding amount. Due to the extent of intersegment sales activity and certain seasonality in inventory levels during the year, we have presented the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory resulting from intersegment transactions in the non-segment items column of our segment reporting (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) . This presentation better aligns segment revenues with segment costs and presents segment EBIT as if each segment was an independent, stand-alone entity. The impact of the above changes on operating results and net assets by segment for 2004 is shown in the table below: Engine Power Generation Components Distribution Non-segment items(1) Millions Increase (decrease) 2004 Net sales $ (76 ) $ (35 ) $ 299 $ 117 $ (305 ) Investee equity, royalty and other income (16 ) (7 ) 23 Segment EBIT (11 ) (9 ) 28 (8 ) Net assets (193 ) (3 ) 108 88 (1) Includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated expenses. Engine Results and Outlook 2006 vs. 2005 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Engine were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Net sales $ 7,511 $ 6,657 $ 854 13 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 67 80 (13 ) (16 )% Segment EBIT 733 582 151 26 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 9.8 % 8.7 % 1.1 percentage points The increase in net sales for this segment was primarily due to strong demand across most markets, particularly the North American heavy-duty truck market and stationary power due to the strong performance of our Power Generation segment, along with strong industrial market sales. Total on-highway-related sales were 63 percent of Engine segment net sales during 2006 and 2005. The improvement in segment EBIT was primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets, the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, improved pricing and manufacturing efficiencies, all of which resulted in a nearly one percentage point improvement in gross margin percentage in 2006 compared to last year. Gross margin increased $221 million, or 18 percent, in 2006 compared to last year. Selling and administrative expenses increased $61 million, or 11 percent, however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly. Research and engineering expenses increased $24 million, or 12 percent, compared to 2005 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales compared to last year. 38 In addition, earnings from joint ventures decreased $13 million compared with 2005, primarily due to a $17 million decrease in earnings at DCEC as a result of weakness in the medium-duty truck market, due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of China truck industry. A summary and discussion of Engine net sales by market follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Heavy-duty truck $ 2,498 $ 2,139 $ 359 17 % Medium-duty truck and bus 971 904 67 7 % Light-duty automotive 1,261 1,178 83 7 % Total on-highway 4,730 4,221 509 12 % Industrial 2,063 1,791 272 15 % Stationary power 718 645 73 11 % Total net sales $ 7,511 $ 6,657 $ 854 13 % A summary of unit shipments by engine classification (including unit shipments to Power Generation) follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Midrange 459,900 419,200 40,700 10 % Heavy-duty 123,400 107,600 15,800 15 % High-horsepower 16,300 14,400 1,900 13 % Total unit shipments 599,600 541,200 58,400 11 % Heavy-Duty Truck The increase in sales to the heavy-duty truck market was primarily driven by the North American truck market as OEMs work to meet growing demand from truck fleets replacing trucks ahead of the 2007 change in emissions standards. Global unit shipments of heavy-duty truck engines were up 17 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, with North American shipments up 18 percent and international shipments up 11 percent. Medium-Duty Truck and Bus The increase in medium-duty truck and bus revenues was due to strong demand ahead of the 2007 change in emission standards and our growing market share position with North American OEMs in the medium duty truck and bus markets. Shipments of medium-duty truck engines were up 36 percent to North American OEMs and down 20 percent to international OEMs compared with 2005. Shipments to North American bus OEMs increased 56 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 while international shipments were down 10 percent. The increase in medium-duty truck and bus engine shipments in North America is due to our increased penetration in this market and an overall increase in demand ahead of the emission standard changes. The decrease in shipments to international medium-duty truck OEMs is primarily due to changes in emissions standards in Brazil to Euro III effective January 1, 2006. The decrease in international bus engine shipments year-over-year is due to a large purchase made in 2005 by a customer in China. 39 Light-Duty Automotive and RV Sales of light-duty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes. Total light-duty automotive unit shipments were approximately 196,000 in 2006, an increase of 5 percent compared to 2005. The majority of the light-duty automotive and RV volumes was driven by demand from DaimlerChrysler with shipments of approximately 162,000 units, or a 1 percent increase compared to 2005. Engine shipments to recreational vehicle OEMs increased by nearly 33 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due to new product introductions and growing penetration at key OEMs. Industrial Total sales were up in most industrial markets, primarily due to strong demand. Unit shipments increased 18 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Approximately 52 percent of the shipments were to North American markets and 48 percent to international markets in 2006 compared to 56 percent and 44 percent, respectively, in 2005. The overall change in the geographic sales mix is due to the continued strength of the international construction market which is being driven by strong demand in the Middle East and Asia. Total shipments to the construction market increased 20 percent largely because international shipments increased 31 percent. Other markets showing significant increases in shipments were the mining market and the oil and gas market with increases of 10 percent and 39 percent, respectively. The mining market demand is up as the strength in commodity prices has been driving investment in mining capacity. The shipments to the oil and gas market have increased as sustained oil and natural gas prices continue to drive activity and investments in new equipment. In addition, we continue to penetrate this market further with the release of more engine platforms to this application. Other industrial markets had modest increases in shipments compared to 2005. Stationary Power The increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased net sales to our Power Generation segment. These net sales are eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings . See the Power Generation Results and Outlook for a discussion of the increase in net sales. 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Engine were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 6,657 $ 5,424 $ 1,233 23 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 80 80 Segment EBIT 582 328 254 77 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 8.7 % 6.0 % 2.7 percentage points The increase in net sales for this segment was primarily due to strong demand across all market sectors, particularly the light-duty automotive market with record engine sales to DaimlerChrysler, and the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty truck markets. Total on-highway-related engine sales were 63 percent of Engine segment net sales in 2005, compared with 65 percent in 2004. The improvement in segment EBIT was primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets, the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts, all of which resulted in a two percentage point improvement in gross margin percentage over 2004. Gross margin increased $344 million, or 38 percent, over 2004. Selling and administrative expenses increased $63 million, or 13 percent, over 2004, however selling and 40 administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved almost a full percentage point. Research and engineering expenses increased $38 million, or 24 percent, compared to 2004 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior period. In addition, earnings from joint ventures remained flat compared with 2004, due to higher earnings from several joint ventures, which were offset by a $7 million decrease in earnings at DCEC in reaction to changes in the regulatory environment. A summary and discussion of Engine net sales by market follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Heavy-duty truck $ 2,139 $ 1,700 $ 439 26 % Medium-duty truck and bus 904 693 211 30 % Light-duty automotive 1,178 1,129 49 4 % Total on-highway 4,221 3,522 699 20 % Industrial 1,791 1,380 411 30 % Stationary power 645 522 123 24 % Total net sales $ 6,657 $ 5,424 $ 1,233 23 % A summary of unit shipments by engine classification (including unit shipments to Power Generation) follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Midrange 419,200 368,700 50,500 14 % Heavy-duty 107,600 87,200 20,400 23 % High-horsepower 14,400 12,100 2,300 19 % Total unit shipments 541,200 468,000 73,200 16 % Heavy-Duty Truck The increase in sales to the heavy-duty truck market was primarily driven by the recovery in the North American truck market as OEMs increased build rates to meet the growing demand from truck fleets replacing aging equipment and adding capacity. Unit shipments of heavy-duty truck engines were up 27 percent in 2005, compared to 2004, with North American shipments up 26 percent and international shipments up 33 percent. Medium-Duty Truck and Bus The increase in medium-duty truck and bus revenues is due to increased shipments of medium-duty truck and bus engines in North America and internationally. Shipments of medium-duty truck engines were up 24 percent to North American OEMs and up 12 percent to international OEMs compared with 2004. The increase in medium-duty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavy-duty market. Sales of bus engines and parts increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to strong demand from North American OEMs with shipments up 53 percent and international shipments up 48 percent. International shipments were up due to strong demand in Asia and Latin America, slightly offset by lower volumes in Europe. 41 Light-Duty Automotive Sales of light-duty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes. Total unit shipments were 187,000 in 2005, an increase of 4 percent compared to 2004. Most of the increase in light-duty automotive sales was driven by continued demand from DaimlerChrysler with record shipments of 160,000 units, or a 4 percent increase compared to 2004. Engine shipments to RV OEMs remained flat in 2005 compared with 2004. Industrial Total sales were up in most industrial markets, primarily due to strong demand as the capital goods sector of the economy expanded. Unit shipments increased 24 percent year-over-year reflecting a slight change in sales mix to higher-priced engines. Approximately 56 percent of the shipments were to North American markets and 44 percent to international markets compared to 52 percent and 48 percent, respectively, in 2004. Both the construction and agricultural markets had increased sales of approximately 28 percent in 2005 over 2004, while sales for the mining and marine markets increased 34 percent and 43 percent, respectively, during the same time period. These markets make up over 90 percent of the total industrial market. The increased sales in these markets were seen both in North American and international markets with the exception of a slight decrease in sales to the international agriculture market. Stationary Power The increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased net sales to our Power Generation segment. These net sales are eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings . See the Power Generation Results and Outlook for a discussion of the increase in net sales. Outlook for 2007 Net sales for this segment are expected to be flat in 2007 with increased shipments in the off-highway and medium-duty truck and bus markets offsetting the decrease in the North American heavy-duty truck market. While North American heavy-duty class 8 truck sales will likely be down 30 to 40 percent in 2007, our year-over-year North American heavy-duty truck engine volumes could be down as much as 50 percent depending on the amount of 2006 engine inventory currently at the truck OEMs. The decline will be most severe in the first half of 2007, with industry shipments expected to improve in the second half of 2007. As a result, we expect our market share to drop in the first quarter, due to OEM carrying over more competitor 2006 engines to manage their vehicle model transition, and quickly recover in the second half of the year to 2006 levels or higher as we believe our new products will quickly gain widespread acceptance versus competitive engine technologies. We expect the Brazilian medium-duty truck market to remain flat in 2007, while our European medium-duty truck engine shipments will benefit from our new supply relationship with Nissan. These markets, together with significant market share gains in North America, are forecasted to drive global medium-duty truck and bus shipments up approximately 25 percent in 2007. We expect shipments to the global light-duty automotive and RV markets to increase nearly 5 percent in 2007 through new product offerings and increased availability of our product at key OEMs. Although some commodity prices have retreated at the end of 2006 from their historical highs, we expect to see sustained demand in 2007 for our engines in the oil and gas and mining equipment markets. Growth in these markets will be paced by our incremental 15 percent capacity expansion planned in our high-horsepower plants during the year. Global construction shipments are expected to show modest growth in 2007 with increased availability at OEMs in North America, India and Japan. We expect 42 earnings for this segment to be the lowest in the first quarter in 2007 with expected improvements throughout the year as we increase operational efficiencies related to new product introduction. New product pricing is expected to be largely offset by new product cost. We anticipate full year EBIT margins will be slightly below or equal to the bottom end of the targeted range of 7 to 10 percent of sales. Power Generation Results and Outlook 2006 vs. 2005 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Power Generation were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Net sales $ 2,416 $ 1,999 $ 417 21 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 12 9 3 33 % Segment EBIT 220 145 75 52 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 9.1 % 7.3 % 1.8 percentage points The increase in net sales in this segment was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of strong demand in the commercial generator set and alternator lines of business and improved pricing. Our commercial and alternator businesses are up in nearly all markets. Our consumer, power electronics, energy solutions and rental markets also saw modest increases. Partially offsetting the increased sales in these lines of business was the absence of sales from SEG as the business was sold in the fourth quarter. The improvement in segment EBIT was largely attributable to strong commercial generator set and alternator sales across geographic markets, except China, as well as improved mix and price realization. While material costs, particularly copper, have increased year-over-year, we have been able to more than absorb these costs through improved pricing. Gross margin improved $91 million, or 27 percent, in 2006 compared to 2005. Gross margin percentage improved nearly one percentage point compared to 2005. Selling and administrative expenses increased $28 million, or 14 percent, over 2005, however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by one half of a percentage point in 2006, compared to 2005. Research and engineering expenses increased $7 million, or 33 percent during 2006, compared to 2005 and as a percentage of net sales increased slightly compared to 2005. A summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Midrange 29,200 21,300 7,900 37 % Heavy-duty 6,800 7,200 (400 ) (6 )% High-horsepower 9,300 8,300 1,000 12 % Total unit shipments 45,300 36,800 8,500 23 % 43 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Power Generation were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 1,999 $ 1,842 $ 157 9 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 9 6 3 50 % Segment EBIT 145 60 85 NM Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 7.3 % 3.3 % 4.0 percentage points The increase in net sales in this segment was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of strong demand in the commercial generator set (genset) markets and alternator markets. Pricing actions also contributed to the increase in net sales. The improvement in segment EBIT was largely attributable to strong commercial generator set sales across all geographic markets, except China, and the related benefits of fixed cost absorption as well as price realization and cost reduction actions. These benefits were partially offset by increased costs of materials, primarily copper. Gross margin improved $67 million, or 25 percent, over 2004. Gross margin percentage improved over two percentage points compared to the prior period. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $3 million, or 2 percent, over 2004 and selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved one percentage point compared to the prior period. Research and engineering expenses decreased $8 million, or 28 percent, compared to 2004 and research and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by 0.5 of a percentage point compared to the prior period. A summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows: Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Midrange 21,300 16,800 4,500 27 % Heavy-duty 7,200 6,700 500 7 % High-horsepower 8,300 7,400 900 12 % Total unit shipments 36,800 30,900 5,900 19 % Outlook for 2007 We expect net sales to grow 10 to 12 percent in 2007, excluding the absence of net sales due to the disposal of SEG in 2006. We expect net sales of commercial generator sets and alternator equipment to continue to be robust in North America, the U.K., the Middle East, Eastern and Western Europe and India. Consumer sales are projected to increase as we ramp up production of portable gensets, introduce auxiliary power units for commercial trucks and expect greater penetration in the towable segment of the RV market. Price realization on new products, global sourcing initiatives and manufacturing efficiency gains are anticipated to produce steady improvement in margins throughout 2007. Earnings for this segment are expected to remain near or at the top end of its targeted range of 7 to 9 percent of sales. 44 Components Results and Outlook 2006 vs. 2005 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Components were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Net sales $ 2,281 $ 2,000 $ 281 14 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 7 8 (1 ) (13 )% Segment EBIT 107 89 18 20 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 4.7 % 4.5 % 0.2 percentage points Components net sales increased across all businesses and all geographic markets, but were primarily driven by strong demand in our turbocharger and fuel systems businesses. We had strong growth in North America and Europe with increases in both aftermarket volume and OEM volume. Segment EBIT improved during 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to improved volume. In addition, EBIT as a percentage of net sales increased slightly. Gross margin increased $56 million, or 17 percent, in 2006 compared to 2005, and gross margin percentage improved nearly one half of a percentage point compared to 2005, primarily due to improved volume and improved pricing. Selling and administrative expenses increased $23 million, or 12 percent, compared to 2005, but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales. Research and engineering expenses increased due to additional investment in the development of a number of new products and critical technologies that will be launched in 2007 and beyond. Research and engineering expenses increased $12 million, or 21 percent, compared to 2005 and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales. 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Components were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 2,000 $ 1,783 $ 217 12 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 8 9 (1 ) (11 )% Segment EBIT 89 84 5 6 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 4.5 % 4.7 % (0.2) percentage points Components net sales increased across all geographic markets primarily due to strong demand in the U.S., Latin America, and Asia. Sales of our turbochargers increased due to higher aftermarket sales to OEMs, partially offset by lower demand in China. Segment EBIT improved slightly, compared with 2004, primarily due to improved volume, however EBIT as a percentage of net sales declined slightly due to a lower gross margin percentage resulting from higher steel prices used in exhaust products and manufacturing filters as well as production inefficiencies driven by capacity constraints. Gross margin increased $33 million, or 11 percent, over 2004, however gross margin percentage decreased slightly. In addition, higher selling and administrative expenses and increases in research and engineering expenses contributed to the reduction in segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales. Selling and administrative expenses increased $18 million, or 10 percent, over 2004, but remained 45 relatively flat year-over-year as a percentage of net sales. Research and engineering expenses increased due to the development of a number of new products that were launched in 2006 and beyond. Research and engineering expenses increased $6 million, or 12 percent, compared to 2004 and remained flat year-over-year as a percentage of net sales. Outlook for 2007 Net sales for this segment are forecasted to grow approximately 18 to 22 percent in 2007, primarily due to growth in our emission solutions and turbocharger businesses. The manufacturing improvements that we began to implement in the second half of 2006 are expected to correct operational issues in the emission solutions business in 2007. The material cost and operational issues in the turbocharger business are expected to yield a slower margin improvement as they ramp up new products. We expect to see sequential improvement in earnings from this segment after the first quarter and to achieve the lower end of the targeted range of 7 to 9 percent of net sales by the end of 2007. Distribution Results and Outlook 2006 vs. 2005 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Distribution were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 Amount Percent Net sales $ 1,385 $ 1,191 $ 194 16 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 54 34 20 59 % Segment EBIT 144 107 37 35 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 10.4 % 9.0 % 1.4 percentage points Distribution net sales increased primarily due to strong overall demand in the Middle East, Europe and the South Pacific. The higher net sales were led by increases in power generation volume followed by parts, service and engine volume. The Middle East is the primary driver for the higher power generation volume accounting for over half of the increase. Parts and service and engine volumes were up throughout several geographic markets, most notably Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East. Segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from greater sales of engines, parts, and power generation equipment. Gross margin in 2006 improved $38 million, or 14 percent, over 2005, however gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to an unfavorable shift in mix from parts to engines and gensets. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased $26 million, or 12 percent; however selling and administrative expenses decreased by over one half of a percentage point as a percentage of net sales in the same period. Also contributing to the increase in segment EBIT year-over-year was a $20 million increase in investee equity earnings primarily attributable to an $18 million increase in earnings at our North American distributors. 46 2005 vs. 2004 The net sales, investee income and segment EBIT for Distribution were as follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, Change 2005 2004 Amount Percent Net sales $ 1,191 $ 973 $ 218 22 % Investee equity, royalty and other income 34 25 9 36 % Segment EBIT 107 79 28 35 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 9.0 % 8.1 % 0.9 percentage points Distribution net sales increased primarily due to strong demand in Europe, Latin America, the South Pacific, North America and the Middle East, where sales at our Dubai distributorship were up 65 percent year-over-year, partially offset by lower sales in East Asia. In addition, net sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates. Segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from increased sales of engines, parts and service, and power generation equipment, as well as pricing actions and favorable exchange rates. Gross margin improved $69 million, or 33 percent, over 2004, while gross margin percentage increased almost two percentage points. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, primarily from acquisitions, new branch openings and dealer development support. Selling and administrative expenses increased $52 million, or 32 percent, and increased just over one percentage point as a percentage of net sales in the same period. Also contributing to the increase in segment EBIT year-over-year was a $9 million increase in investee equity earnings. This is primarily attributable to an $8 million increase in earnings at our North American distributors. Outlook for 2007 We will no longer consolidate one of our North American joint ventures, beginning in 2007. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding this joint venture. In addition, an independent distributor in Iraq will market the sales of power generation equipment in that country rather than through our company-owned distributor in Dubai. Excluding these changes to the reporting of segment revenue, we expect net sales to increase between 7 and 10 percent in 2007. While we are adding two distributors in Europe early in 2007, the majority of this growth will be organic from existing distributors. Non-residential construction spending outside of the U.S. is expected to continue to drive our revenue growth in power generation and the off-highway engine markets. We also announced the formation of joint ventures in Thailand and Nigeria and expect to finalize new joint ventures in Colombia, South America and the Carolinas here in the U.S. early in 2007. Earnings for this segment are forecasted to remain above the top end of its targeted range of 8 to 10 percent of sales. Geographic Markets Sales to international markets were 50 percent of total net sales in 2006, compared with 51 percent of total net sales in 2005 and 48 percent of total net sales in 2004. 47 A summary of net sales (dollar amount and percentage of total) by geographic territory follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 United States $ 5,719 50 % $ 4,832 49 % $ 4,363 52 % Asia/Australia 1,794 16 % 1,682 17 % 1,474 17 % Europe/CIS 1,633 14 % 1,406 14 % 1,145 14 % Mexico/Latin America 886 8 % 819 8 % 567 7 % Canada 743 7 % 728 7 % 549 6 % Africa/Middle East 587 5 % 451 5 % 340 4 % Total international 5,643 50 % 5,086 51 % 4,075 48 % Total consolidated net sales $ 11,362 100 % $ 9,918 100 % $ 8,438 100 % LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Capital Structure Cash provided by operations is the primary source of funding our working capital requirements. At certain times, cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and as a result, we may use periodic borrowings, primarily our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable sales program, to fund our working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our receivable sales program. Cash and cash equivalents increased $61 million during 2006 to $840 million at the end of the year compared to $779 million at the beginning of the year. Cash and cash equivalents were higher in 2006 as a result of an increase in cash provided by operations generated primarily by higher net earnings. We have focused much of our efforts on improving our balance sheet through debt reduction and increasing our liquidity. We believe our net debt position is a strong indicator of how much progress we have made in these areas. This measure is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our net debt position is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Millions Total debt $ 811 $ 1,367 $ 1,626 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (935 ) (840 ) (673 ) Net debt $ (124 ) $ 527 $ 953 At December 31, 2006, we believe our liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $840 million, marketable securities of $95 million, $542 million available under our revolving credit facility, $200 million available under our accounts receivable program and $123 million available under international credit facilities (see the table below under Available Credit Capacity) provides us with the financial flexibility needed to satisfy future short-term funding requirements for working capital, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, projected pension funding, common stock repurchases, dividend payments and expansion in emerging markets. The Jobs Act provided for a temporary 85-percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction resulted in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. We repatriated $71 million under the Jobs Act in 2005. Foreign earnings repatriated under the Jobs Act increased liquidity in the United States, with a corresponding reduction of liquidity in our foreign subsidiaries. 48 Our total debt was $811 million as of December 31, 2006, compared with $1,367 million at December 31, 2005. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 22.4 percent at December 31, 2006, compared to 42.3 percent at December 31, 2005. Included in long-term debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005, was $60 million and $71 million, respectively, attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Notes 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). Also included in short-term and long-term debt at December 31, 2006, was $67 million from the consolidation of two joint ventures consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46R (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements ). The consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our 2006 or 2005 net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants. We do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods. Available Credit Capacity The table below provides the components of available credit capacity as of December 31: 2006 Millions Revolving credit facility $ 542 International credit facilities accessible by local entities 84 International credit facilities accessible by corporate treasury 39 Accounts receivable sales program 200 Total available credit capacity $ 865 Working Capital Summary 2006 2005 $ in millions Current assets $ 4,488 $ 3,916 Current liabilities 2,399 2,218 Working capital $ 2,089 $ 1,698 Current ratio 1.87 1.77 Days sales in receivables 52 49 Inventory turnover 6.6 7.0 Cash Flows The following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 2004 Millions Net cash provided by operating activities $ 840 $ 760 $ 614 Net cash used in investing activities (277 ) (212 ) (181 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (508 ) (372 ) 66 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 6 (8 ) 4 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ 168 $ 503 49 2006 versus 2005 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities improved $80 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to $165 million of higher net earnings and an $82 million decrease in cash utilized for working capital, partially offset by an increase in pension funding of $115 million and a decrease in cash provided by changes in long term liabilities of $65 million. Net changes in working capital utilized $226 million in cash during 2006 compared to utilizing $308 million in 2005, or a net decrease in cash utilized for working capital of $82 million year-over-year. Cash utilized for working capital tends to fluctuate from period to period based on various factors including, sales and production volumes as well as timing. Pension funding increased year-over-year, as we made additional contributions towards our goal of reaching 90 percent funded by the end of 2007. As of the end of 2006, our global pension funding was at approximately 88.5 percent of global pension benefit obligations. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in long-term interest rates have had a negative impact on the projected and accumulated obligation, however, better than expected investment returns and additional voluntary contributions have improved the funded status of all plans, helping to minimize future required funding. During 2006 we made cash contributions of $266 million. We expect to contribute approximately $230 million to $240 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2007. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $65 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $76 million, which includes an increase in investments in internal use software of $13 million. Net cash utilized for purchases of marketable securities in 2006 was $30 million as we increased our short term investment holdings as opposed to 2005 when we were in a net liquidation of securities position with net cash proceeds of $3 million. Significant sources of cash from investing activities year-over-year includes increased proceeds from the disposal of equipment of $28 million as well as $24 million received related to the sale of SEG. The majority of our capital spending in 2006 was primarily for new product introduction, capacity expansion, manufacturing equipment, and tooling for new products. Capital expenditures for 2007 will increase to support our growth, and will include investments to increase capacity and to fund our new products. Our investments in capacity improvement are focused, cut across all of our businesses and designed for rapid return on investment. We continue to invest more of our capital in low-cost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction. We currently expect capital expenditures for 2007 to be between $320 million and $350 million to support these initiatives. Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $508 million in 2006 compared to a use of cash of $372 million in 2005, or a net change in cash outflows of $136 million year-over-year. In 2006, we repaid our $250 million 9.5% notes while in 2005 we repaid our $225 million 6.45% notes. The other significant use of cash in financing activities when comparing 2006 to 2005 relates to repurchases of our common stock. In 2006 we completed our previously announced $100 million stock repurchase and we began repurchasing stock under a new repurchase plan that began in the third quarter of 2006. Year over year our stock repurchases increased $83 million. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, was a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $21 million and an increase in dividend payments due to the 20 percent increase in quarterly dividends that the board approved in July. 2005 versus 2004 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities improved $146 million in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to $200 million of higher net earnings, a $175 million increase in the deferred tax provision, a $101 million increase in long-term liabilities and a $35 million change in equity earnings of investees, partially offset by an increase in working capital of $378 million. Net changes in 50 working capital utilized $308 million in cash during 2005 compared to providing $70 million in 2004, or a net decrease in cash provided by working capital of $378 million year-over-year. The net increase of $378 million of cash used by changes in working capital compared to 2004 resulted primarily from lower accrued expenses of $148 million, higher accounts receivable of $146 million and lower accounts payable of $102 million, partially offset by lower inventory of $17 million and changes in other current assets of $1 million. Accounts receivable increased due to higher sales levels, a higher mix of international receivables, and the discontinuance of a major customer trade payables program that previously allowed for accelerated payment terms. The net reduction in accounts payable was due to a larger ramp-up in production during 2004 and the decrease in accrued expenses was driven by a lower increase in accrued warranty of $86 million and a lower increase in accrued payrolls of $63 million. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $31 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $41 million, which included investments in internal use software of $6 million and a decrease in cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities of $24 million, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in cash used for acquisition of businesses, investments in and advances to equity investees of $6 million, and an increase in proceeds from disposals of $9 million. The majority of our capital spending of $186 million in 2005 was primarily for capacity increases, manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products. Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $372 million in 2005 compared to a $66 million source of cash in 2004, or a net change in cash outflows of $438 million year-over-year. The majority of the change year-over-year is due to the March 1, 2005, repayment of the $225 million 6.45% notes, a significant decrease in the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of stock options of $118 million and $38 million in common stock repurchases in 2005. Cash Dividends Cash dividends of $0.30 per common share were declared in the first and second quarter of 2006. In July 2006, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 20 percent, and as a result cash dividends of $0.36 per common share were declared in the third and fourth quarter of 2006. Cash dividends of $0.30 per common share were declared and paid in each quarter of 2005 and 2004. Dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $66 million, $56 million and $53 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our earnings and liquidity position, among other factors. Share Repurchases In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to two million shares of Cummins common stock in addition to what has been acquired under previous authorizations. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased approximately $121 million of common stock, representing approximately 1.1 million shares. This included purchases under our $100 million share repurchase program introduced in September 2005, which was completed in the second quarter of 2006. Debt Conversion On May 8, 2006, the Board of Directors approved our plan to redeem all of the 7% convertible quarterly income preferred securities that were issued in June 2001. On May 9, 2006, we gave the trustee our formal irrevocable notification of our intent to redeem the preferred securities. This notification provided the holders of the preferred securities 30 days in which to convert their securities into shares of common stock. Upon expiration of the notification period, all remaining securities not converted were redeemed for cash at a premium above liquidation value. Substantially all of the $300 million 7% 51 convertible subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2006. As a result of the conversion, approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock were issued during the second quarter which resulted in an increase of approximately $15 million to common stock outstanding and an increase of approximately $276 million to additional contributed capital. Since substantially all holders converted their preferred securities to common stock, the loss on extinguishment of this debt was insignificant. Debt Repayment In September 2005, we announced our intention to repay the $250 million 9.5% notes in December 2006, the first call date for the debt. The notes were issued in November 2002 and were repaid in December 2006 using cash generated from operations. We paid a premium of approximately $12 million due to the early retirement of this debt. Approximately $62 million of our $120 million 6.75% debentures were repaid on February 15, 2007, at the election of the holders. Such election and notification was required to be made between December 15, 2006 and January 15, 2007. At December 31, 2006, we have included the $62 million repaid on February 15, 2007, in short-term borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet . Lease Extension In July 2006, we amended and extended the lease on our corporate headquarters facility to 2019. The total rental payments to be made over the revised lease term are approximately $59 million. As a result of this extension, we were required to re-evaluate the classification of this lease. Based on the terms of the extension, this lease is now classified as a capital lease. As a result, our long-term debt increased by approximately $40 million. Rental Business During the third quarter of 2006, we extended a lease relating to a portion of our rental business by six years. The lease was set to expire on September 30, 2006. Instead of paying a balloon payment of approximately $42 million on September 30, 2006, the amount has been financed over a six year term at a fixed rate. In addition to extending this lease, we reduced the interest rate by approximately 2 percentage points. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we refinanced a lease relating to another portion of our rental business. Under the terms of the agreement which is effective as of January 1, 2007, the new lease has a six year term and the interest rate is approximately 2 percentage points lower than the existing lease. The total amount refinanced was approximately $28 million. Both leases were treated as capital leases both before and after the changes. For more information regarding our rental business and related lease agreements, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 52 Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments A summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2006, is shown in the tables below: Contractual Cash Obligations 2007 2008-2009 2010-2011 After 2011 Total Millions Loans payable $ 37 $ $ $ $ 37 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations(1) 203 261 144 1,564 2,172 Operating leases 39 54 33 23 149 Capital expenditures 103 1 104 Purchase commitments for inventory 483 483 Other purchase commitments 68 15 5 1 89 Joint venture funding commitments 48 23 71 Pension funding(2) 235 235 Other postretirement benefits 56 112 109 235 512 Total $ 1,272 $ 466 $ 291 $ 1,823 $ 3,852 (1) Includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations.

There have been no events in 2006 to impede our compliance with these covenants. Our current ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below. Credit Rating Agency Senior L-T Debt Rating S-T Debt Rating Outlook Moody Investors Service, Inc. Baa3 Non-Prime Stable Standard & Poor BBB- NR Stable Fitch BBB- BBB- Positive 53 Off Balance Sheet Financing Sale of Accounts Receivable In January 2004, we entered into a three-year facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Trade Receivables, LLC (CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary. In January 2007, this facility was extended for one year. As necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in Receivables, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $200 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility. There was no interest in receivables sold under this program to the financial institution in 2006 or 2005 and the interest in receivables sold in 2004 was not significant. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. Financing Arrangements for Related Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures, sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value. We purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines, components and service parts from Consolidated Diesel Company (CDC), a general partnership that was formed in 1980 with J. I. Case (Case) to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity. Cummins and Case (now CNH Global N.V.) are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in CDC. Under the terms of the agreement, CDC is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners. Each partner is entitled to purchase up to one-half of CDC actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one-half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner purchase requirement. The partners are each obligated, unconditionally and severally, to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by CDC, provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced. The transfer price of CDC engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period, including interest and financing expenses, but excluding depreciation expense (other than Scheduled Depreciation Expense as defined in the agreement). In addition, each partner is obligated to contribute one-half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity, which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee. To date, neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at CDC. We are not a guarantor of any of CDC obligations or commitments. However, we are required as a partner, to provide up to 50 percent of CDC base working capital as defined by the agreement. The amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required, the amount is funded through third-party financing arranged by CDC, or we may elect to fund the requirement, although we are under no obligation to do so. To date, when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount, we have elected to provide that funding to CDC. If the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount, it is funded equally by the partners. Excess cash generated by CDC is remitted to Cummins until 54 CDC working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount. Any further cash remittances from CDC to the partners are shared equally by the partners. In the first quarter of 2004, we adopted certain provisions of FIN 46R. Under the provisions of FIN 46R, CDC and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us were considered VIEs and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of CDC and the other engine manufacturer as of March 28, 2004. Previously, these joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Investments in and advances to equity investees. First quarter results for these entities were recorded as Investee equity, royalty and other income in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and results for the rest of the year were consolidated in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For a further discussion of the impact of adopting FIN 46R, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives other than for the adoption of new accounting pronouncements as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . There were no accounting policies adopted during 2006 that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that often require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for warranty programs, primarily base warranty, other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the time of failure. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a 55 clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2006 and 2005 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2006, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $696 million. These assets include $39 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $26 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing certain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards are disclosed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K., and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, (SFAS 87) and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 87 requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span, and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future . SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The Statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. We adopted SFAS 158 as required on December 31, 2006. We did not adopt the measurement date change as it is not required until December 31, 2008. 56 The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets used to develop our pension expense was 8.5 percent for each year ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. The expected rate of return on non-U.S. pension plan assets was 7.24 percent, 7.56 percent, and 8.08 percent, respectively. In 2007, we plan to use an expected rate of return of 8.5 percent for U.S pension plan assets and 7.25 percent for non-U.S. pension plan assets. A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2006, we had net pension actuarial losses of $468 million and $358 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under SFAS 158 the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. Our net periodic pension expense was $120 million in 2006, $103 million in 2005, and $89 million in 2004. Our net periodic pension expense is expected to be approximately $97 million in 2007. The decrease in periodic pension expense is due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in 2006. In addition, our expense is expected to decline as the amortization of prior investment losses begins to be replaced with the amortization of prior investment gains. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The discount rate used to develop our net periodic pension expense in the U.S. was 5.60 percent, 5.75 percent, and 6.25 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. The discount rate for our non-U.S. pension expense was 4.95 percent, 5.30 percent, and 5.66 percent. We will use 5.60 percent and 4.96 percent for U.S. and non-U.S. pension expense in 2007. Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation. Our funding strategy is to fund the plan approximately 90 percent on a PBO basis. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in EITF D-36 which suggests a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Standard & Poors for the U.S. and iBoxx for the U.K. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, noncallable bonds (AA or better) as of November 30, 2006. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to SFAS 87 and SFAS No. 106, Employer Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Our model called for 60 years of benefit payments. For the U.S. plans, the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process. The number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio. The discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. In developing the U.K. discount rate, excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60 year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years, thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed. As a result, the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining. We made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. Due to the flat shape of the yield curve, 57 this methodology choice impacted the discount rate by less than two basis percentage points. The discount rate would have been slightly higher had the cash flows been allowed to reinvest. The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2007 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Millions Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25 percent increase $ (8.3 ) 0.25 percent decrease 8.6 Expected rate of return on assets: 1 percent increase (25.9 ) 1 percent decrease 25.8 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets, including historical returns and input from our external advisors. The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, real estate and other miscellaneous investments. Based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.73 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 9.28 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. Our three year average rate of return has exceeded 8.5 percent in each of the last three years. As a result, based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.5 percent per year for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and target allocation for 2007 are as follows: Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Investment description 2007 2006 2005 Equity securities 60-80% 62.7 % 64.1 % Fixed income 23-33% 33.4 % 33.5 % Real estate/Other 3-7% 3.9 % 2.4 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( the Act ). The Act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes. Among its many provisions, the Act establishes a 100 percent funding target for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. We may voluntarily make contributions to achieve our funding strategy described above. During 2006 and 2005, we made cash 58 contributions to our pension plans of $266 million and $151 million, respectively, and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $230 million to $240 million in 2007. Contributions beyond 2007 will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the Act. The minimum pension liability was eliminated upon the adoption of SFAS 158. The estimated accumulated benefit obligation related to the U.S., U.K. and several other smaller pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Changes in the minimum pension liability decreased our shareholders equity by $24 million, (after tax and minority interest), in 2005. Prior to adopting SFAS 158, additional minimum pension liabilities were reduced by $102 million (after tax and minority interest) through a direct credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss. The reduction of these liabilities resulted from strong plan asset performance and significant pension contributions in 2005 and 2006. Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans, the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the impacts of SFAS 158. Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate its weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. As of the end of the third quarter in 2006, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by SFAS 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2006, our recorded goodwill was $356 million. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill. 59 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). This standard requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions. Share-based payment transactions within the scope of SFAS 123R include stock options, restricted stock plans, performance-based awards, stock appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans. We implemented the revised standard in the first quarter of 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based employee awards issued after December 31, 2002, using the fair value method preferred by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS 123R requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock-based compensation as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. SFAS 123R also requires prospective presentation of the Tax benefit on share-based awards as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154). This standard changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those provisions should be followed. APB 20 required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. This standard requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The provisions of SFAS 154 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements. Traditionally, there have been two widely-recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements: the roll-over method and the iron curtain method. The roll-over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement, including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements, but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet. The iron curtain method, on the other hand, focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior years on the income statement. We currently use the iron curtain method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements. In SAB 108, the SEC staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company financial statements and related financial statement disclosures. This model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and roll-over methods. We were required to apply the provisions of SAB 108 in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. The application of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158), which requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements. In 60 addition, SFAS 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and liabilities as of the end of a fiscal year rather than a date within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year. We adopted SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006, except for the change in measurement date provisions which are not effective until 2008. Total assets, total liabilities, minority interests and total shareholders equity were impacted in the following manner. Total assets increased by approximately $11 million, total liabilities increased by approximately $106 million, minority interests decreased by approximately $1 million and shareholders equity decreased by approximately $94 million. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not impact compliance with any of our financial covenants. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our Consolidated Financial Statements . ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 changes certain accounting requirements for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. The new standard also changed certain accounting requirements for interest-only and principal-only strips and other aspects of accounting for securitized financial assets. We will adopt SFAS 155 effective January 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 156), that provides guidance on accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 156, separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. Subsequent to initial recognition, the company may use either the amortization method or the fair value measurement method to account for servicing assets and servicing liabilities within the scope of this Statement. We will adopt SFAS 156 effective January 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 156 to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements, uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. We will adopt FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We will adopt SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements . DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain parts of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate and management beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words, such as anticipates, expects, forecasts, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates or similar expressions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which we refer to as future factors, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual 61 outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Future factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements are discussed below. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Future factors that could affect the outcome of forward-looking statements include the following: price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological developments of diesel engines; the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products in a timely, cost-effective basis; the sales mix of products; the achievement of lower costs and expenses; domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, including environmental regulations; protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights; reliance on large customers; technological, implementation and cost/financial risks in increasing use of large, multi-year contracts; the cyclical nature of our business; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; continued availability of financing, financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to support our future business; and other risk factors described in Part I of this report under the caption RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, general domestic and international economic conditions, including the price of crude oil (diesel fuel), interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other future factors.
