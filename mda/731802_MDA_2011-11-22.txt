ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. INTRODUCTION This section provides management discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , goal , intend , objective , plan , projection , seek , strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of environmental regulations on our business; the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas; adverse weather conditions; the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our gas distribution business; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business, natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events, and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various 34 Table of Contents other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to risk management and trading activities, fair value measurements, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee periodically. Actual results may differ from estimates. Regulation Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. We meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity, which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards. We apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. The impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations. Revenue recognition Sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense. On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented. Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company non-gas costs. These mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost, such as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company other costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility company cost of service and (iii) is generally outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs. Although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet. Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and nonregulated segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided. Operating revenues for our nonregulated segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our 35 Table of Contents customers. Operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. For the majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer inability or reluctance to pay, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. Financial instruments and hedging activities We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses. We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States , with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement. The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur. Financial Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk In our natural gas distribution segment, our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season. The costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments. Our nonregulated segment aggregates and purchases gas supply, arranges transportation and/or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices. We also perform asset optimization activities in which we seek to maximize the economic value associated with storage and transportation capacity we own or control in both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated businesses. As a result of these activities, our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. In our nonregulated segment, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change. The financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the spreads 36 Table of Contents between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled. The difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins. We have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value hedges. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized. Over time, we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction. We have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in our nonregulated segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a component of revenue. We also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our nonregulated segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not been designated as hedges. Financial Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we issue new or refinance existing long-term debt with Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We designate these Treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements are executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each Treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a component of interest expense. Impairment assessments We perform impairment assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to amortization and long-lived assets. As of September 30, 2011, we had no indefinite-lived intangible assets. We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value. We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long-lived assets is at risk. 37 Table of Contents When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate. These cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset. Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a September 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A 0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $1.9 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $0.8 million. Fair Value Measurements We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements. Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our nonregulated operations, we utilize a 38 Table of Contents mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement, as permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed. We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current market conditions. We believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities. Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. Adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets in the last few years have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short-term capital markets, which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties. A further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances. Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions, each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 62 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years. Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year. Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers. During fiscal 2011, we earned $207.6 million, or $2.27 per diluted share, which represents a one percent increase in net income and a three percent increase in diluted net income per share over fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution segment and a successful regulatory outcome in our regulated transmission and storage segment offset a seven percent year-over-year decline in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to warmer weather and a 108 percent decrease in asset optimization margins as a result of weak natural gas market fundamentals. Results for fiscal 2011 were influenced by several non-recurring items, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.03. The increase in fiscal 2011 earnings per share also reflects the favorable impact of our accelerated share buyback 39 Table of Contents agreement initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.08. On May 12, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa to Liberty Energy (Midstates) Corporation, an affiliate of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. for a cash price of approximately $124 million. The agreement contains terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type, including typical adjustments to the purchase price at closing, if applicable. The closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. Due to the pending sales transaction, the results of operations for these three service areas are shown in discontinued operations. On June 10, 2011 we issued $400 million of 5.50% senior notes. The effective interest rate on these notes is 5.381 percent, after giving effect to offering costs and the settlement of the $300 million Treasury locks associated with the offering. Substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately $394 million were used to repay $350 million of outstanding commercial paper. The remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. The Treasury locks were settled on June 7, 2011 with the receipt of $20.1 million from the counterparties due to an increase in the 30-year Treasury lock rates between inception of the Treasury locks and settlement. Because the Treasury locks were effective, the net $12.6 million unrealized gain was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the 30-year life of the senior notes. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we executed on our strategy to streamline our credit facilities, as follows: On May 2, 2011, we replaced our five-year $566.7 million unsecured credit facility, due to expire in December 2011, with a five-year $750 million unsecured credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion. In December 2010, we replaced AEM $450 million 364-day facility with a $200 million, three-year facility. The reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low cost of gas and AEM ability to access an intercompany facility that was increased in fiscal 2011; however, this facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to $500 million. In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million 364-day revolving credit agreement with a $200 million 180-day revolving credit agreement that expired in April 2011. As planned, we did not replace or extend this agreement. After giving effect to these changes, we now have $985 million of liquidity available to us from our commercial paper program and four committed credit facilities and have reduced our financing costs. We believe this availability provides sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs. 40 Table of Contents Consolidated Results The following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands, except per share data) Operating revenues $ 4,347,634 $ 4,719,835 $ 4,869,111 Gross profit 1,327,241 1,337,505 1,319,678 Operating expenses 885,342 860,354 883,312 Operating income 441,899 477,151 436,366 Miscellaneous income (expense) 21,499 (156 ) (3,067 ) Interest charges 150,825 154,360 152,638 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 312,573 322,635 280,661 Income tax expense 113,689 124,362 97,362 Income from continuing operations 198,884 198,273 183,299 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 8,717 7,566 7,679 Net income $ 207,601 $ 205,839 $ 190,978 Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 2.17 $ 2.12 $ 1.98 Diluted net income per share from discontinued operations $ 0.10 $ 0.08 $ 0.09 Diluted net income per share $ 2.27 $ 2.20 $ 2.07 Historically, our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income. Regulated operations contributed 104 percent, 81 percent and 83 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009. Our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Natural gas distribution segment $ 162,718 $ 125,949 $ 116,807 Regulated transmission and storage segment 52,415 41,486 41,056 Nonregulated segment (7,532 ) 38,404 33,115 Net income $ 207,601 $ 205,839 $ 190,978 The following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands, except per share data) Regulated operations $ 215,133 $ 167,435 $ 157,863 Nonregulated operations (7,532 ) 38,404 33,115 Consolidated net income $ 207,601 $ 205,839 $ 190,978 Diluted EPS from regulated operations $ 2.35 $ 1.79 $ 1.71 Diluted EPS from nonregulated operations (0.08 ) 0.41 0.36 Consolidated diluted EPS $ 2.27 $ 2.20 $ 2.07 41 Table of Contents We reported net income of $207.6 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2011, compared with net income of $205.8 million or $2.20 per diluted share in the prior year. Income from continuing operations was $198.9 million, or $2.17 per diluted share compared with $198.3 million, or $2.12 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations was $8.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the year, compared with $7.6 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the prior year. Unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during the current year reduced net income by $6.6 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in the prior year of $4.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. Additionally, net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items. In the prior year, net income included the net positive impact of a state sales tax refund of $4.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. In the current year, net income includes the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $3.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share related to the following pre-tax amounts: $27.8 million favorable impact related to the cash gain recorded in association with the unwinding of two Treasury locks in conjunction with the cancellation of a planned debt offering in November 2011. $30.3 million unfavorable impact related to the non-cash impairment of certain assets in our nonregulated business. $5.0 million favorable impact related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions. Net income during fiscal 2010 increased eight percent over fiscal 2009. Net income from our regulated operations increased six percent during fiscal 2010. The increase primarily reflects colder than normal weather in most of our service areas during fiscal 2010 as well as the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment. Net income in our nonregulated operations increased $5.3 million during fiscal 2010 primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins. Non-cash, net unrealized losses totaled $4.3 million which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per diluted share in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, when net unrealized losses totaled $21.6 million, which reduced earnings per share by $0.23 per diluted share. See the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments. Natural Gas Distribution Segment The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and, ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating income. As discussed above, the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt 42 Table of Contents expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. In addition, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. However, gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 73 percent of our residential and commercial margins. In May 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. The results of these operations have been separately reported in the following tables and exclude general corporate overhead and interest expense that would normally be allocated to these operations. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are presented below.

The presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (In thousands) Mid-Tex $ 144,204 $ 134,655 $ 127,625 $ 9,549 $ 7,030 Kentucky/Mid-States 53,506 46,238 37,683 7,268 8,555 Louisiana 50,442 45,759 43,434 4,683 2,325 West Texas 29,686 33,509 23,338 (3,823 ) 10,171 Mississippi 26,338 26,441 21,287 (103 ) 5,154 Colorado-Kansas 25,920 24,543 20,580 1,377 3,963 Other 7,905 (976 ) 4,031 8,881 (5,007 ) Total $ 338,001 $ 310,169 $ 277,978 $ 27,832 $ 32,191 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 The $22.4 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a $40.4 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in the Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Kentucky and Kansas service areas. These increases were partially offset by: $12.0 million decrease due to a seven percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather this fiscal year compared to the same period last year in most of our service areas. $8.1 million decrease in revenue-related taxes, primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income decreased $5.5 million, primarily due to the following: $10.0 million decrease in taxes, other than income, due to lower revenue-related taxes. $6.4 million decrease in employee-related expenses. These decreases were partially offset by: $5.4 million increase due to the absence of a state sales tax reimbursement received in the prior year. $11.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. $1.8 million increase in vehicles and equipment expense. Net income for this segment for the year-to-date period was also favorably impacted by a $21.8 million pre-tax gain recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks and a $5.0 million income tax benefit related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 The $24.4 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects rate adjustments and increased throughput as follows: $33.4 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily in the West Texas, Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and Mississippi service areas. 44 Table of Contents $10.6 million increase as a result of an 11 percent increase in consolidated throughput primarily associated with higher residential and commercial consumption and colder weather in most of our service areas. These increases were partially offset by: $7.6 million decrease due to a non-recurring adjustment recorded in the prior-year period to update the estimate for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect base rate changes. $7.0 million decrease related to a prior-year reversal of an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs that did not recur in the current year. $1.6 million decrease in revenue-related taxes, primarily due to a decrease in revenues on which the tax is calculated. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset impairments decreased $7.8 million, primarily due to the following: $5.4 million decrease due to a state sales tax reimbursement received in March 2010. $4.6 million decrease due to the absence of an impairment charge for available-for-sale securities recorded in the prior year. $4.5 million decrease in contract labor expenses. $4.6 million decrease in travel, legal and other administrative costs. These decreases were partially offset by: $7.5 million increase in employee-related expenses. $4.5 million increase in taxes, other than income. Miscellaneous income decreased $4.4 million due to lower interest income. Interest charges decreased $5.5 million primarily due to lower short-term debt balances and interest rates. Additionally, results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, were favorably impacted by a one-time tax benefit of $10.5 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company completed a study of the calculations used to estimate its deferred tax rate, and concluded that revisions to these calculations to include more specific jurisdictional tax rates would result in a more accurate calculation of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future. Accordingly, the Company modified the tax rate used to calculate deferred taxes from 38 percent to an individual rate for each legal entity. These rates vary from 36-41 percent depending on the jurisdiction of the legal entity. Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division. The Atmos Pipeline Texas Division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas. Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our Mid-Tex service area. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains. 45 Table of Contents The results of Atmos Pipeline Texas Division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Mid-Tex Division transportation $ 125,973 $ 102,891 $ 89,348 $ 23,082 $ 13,543 Third-party transportation 73,676 73,648 95,314 28 (21,666 ) Storage and park and lend services 7,995 10,657 11,858 (2,662 ) (1,201 ) Other 11,729 15,817 13,138 (4,088 ) 2,679 Gross profit 219,373 203,013 209,658 16,360 (6,645 ) Operating expenses 111,098 105,975 116,495 5,123 (10,520 ) Operating income 108,275 97,038 93,163 11,237 3,875 Miscellaneous income 4,715 135 1,433 4,580 (1,298 ) Interest charges 31,432 31,174 30,982 258 192 Income before income taxes 81,558 65,999 63,614 15,559 2,385 Income tax expense 29,143 24,513 22,558 4,630 1,955 Net income $ 52,415 $ 41,486 $ 41,056 $ 10,929 $ 430 Gross pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 620,904 634,885 706,132 (13,981 ) (71,247 ) Consolidated pipeline transportation volumes MMcf 435,012 428,599 528,689 6,413 (100,090 ) Fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 On April 18, 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) issued an order in the rate case of Atmos Pipeline Texas (APT) that was originally filed in September 2010. The RRC approved an annual operating income increase of $20.4 million as well as the following major provisions that went into effect with bills rendered on and after May 1, 2011: Authorized return on equity of 11.8 percent. A capital structure of 49.5 percent debt/50.5 percent equity Approval of a rate base of $807.7 million, compared to the $417.1 million rate base from the prior rate case. An annual adjustment mechanism, which was approved for a three-year pilot program, that will adjust regulated rates up or down by 75 percent of the difference between APT non-regulated annual revenue and a pre-defined base credit. Approval of a straight fixed variable rate design, under which all fixed costs associated with transportation and storage services are recovered through monthly customer charges. 46 Table of Contents The $16.4 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following: $23.4 million net increase as a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in May 2011. $3.2 million increase associated with our most recent GRIP filing. These increases were partially offset by the following: $4.8 million decrease due to the absence of the sale of excess gas, which occurred in the prior year. $4.4 million decrease due to a decline in throughput to our Mid-Tex Division primarily due to warmer than normal weather during fiscal 2011. Operating expenses increased $5.1 million primarily due to the following: $4.6 million increase due to higher depreciation expense. $2.0 million increase due to the absence of a state sales tax reimbursement received in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by the following: $0.8 million decrease related to lower levels of pipeline maintenance activities. $0.7 million decrease due to lower employee-related expenses. Miscellaneous income includes a $6.0 million gain recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury locks. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 The $6.6 million decrease in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following factors: $13.3 million decrease due to lower transportation fees on through-system deliveries due to narrower basis spreads. $2.6 million decrease due to decreased through-system volumes primarily associated with market conditions that resulted in reduced wellhead production, decreased drilling activity and increased competition, partially offset by increased deliveries to our Mid-Tex Division. $1.6 million net decrease in market-based demand fees, priority reservation fees and compression activity associated with lower throughput. These decreases were partially offset by the following: $9.3 million increase associated with our GRIP filings. $2.0 million increase of excess inventory sales in the current-year period. Operating expenses decreased $10.5 million primarily due to: $11.8 million decrease related to reduced contract labor. $2.0 million decrease due to a state sales tax reimbursement received in March 2010. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in taxes, other than income due to higher ad valorem and payroll taxes. Miscellaneous income decreased $1.3 million due primarily to a decline in intercompany interest income. 47 Table of Contents Nonregulated Segment Our nonregulated activities are conducted through Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Corporation and operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the United States. AEH primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices. In addition, AEH utilizes proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and management services, transportation services, peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a result, AEH gas delivery and related services margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers. AEH storage and transportation margins arise from (i) utilizing its proprietary 21-mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in Louisiana, its gas delivery activities and, on a more limited basis, for third parties and (ii) managing proprietary storage in Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods. AEH also seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing, through asset optimization activities, the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls in our natural gas distribution and by its subsidiaries. We attempt to meet these objectives by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. This process involves purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which AEH has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin. AEH continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEH may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions. If AEH elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas, it will execute new financial instruments to offset the original financial instruments. If AEH elects to defer the withdrawal of gas, it will execute new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule and allow the original financial instrument to settle as contracted. We use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities. These financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change. The hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change. Changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized. AEH also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities. Changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled. Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices and differences in natural gas prices between the various markets that we serve (commonly referred to as basis differentials), have a significant impact on our 48 Table of Contents nonregulated businesses. Within our delivered gas activities, basis differentials impact our ability to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access. Further, higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Higher gas prices, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources. Within our asset optimization activities, higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our nonregulated segment. Increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities. Volatility could also impact the basis differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities. However, increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could cause an increase in the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are presented below. Gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers, margins earned from storage and transportation services and margins earned from asset optimization activities, which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third-party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities. Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period. 49 Table of Contents For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Realized margins Gas delivery and related services $ 58,990 $ 59,523 $ 75,341 $ (533 ) $ (15,818 ) Storage and transportation services 14,570 13,206 12,784 1,364 422 Other 5,265 5,347 9,365 (82 ) (4,018 ) 78,825 78,076 97,490 749 (19,414 ) Asset optimization (1) (3,424 ) 43,805 52,507 (47,229 ) (8,702 ) Total realized margins 75,401 121,881 149,997 (46,480 ) (28,116 ) Unrealized margins (10,401 ) (7,790 ) (35,889 ) (2,611 ) 28,099 Gross profit 65,000 114,091 114,108 (49,091 ) (17 ) Operating expenses, excluding asset impairment 39,113 44,147 49,046 (5,034 ) (4,899 ) Asset impairment 30,270 181 30,270 (181 ) Operating income (loss) (4,383 ) 69,944 64,881 (74,327 ) 5,063 Miscellaneous income 657 3,859 6,399 (3,202 ) (2,540 ) Interest charges 4,015 10,584 14,350 (6,569 ) (3,766 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (7,741 ) 63,219 56,930 (70,960 ) 6,289 Income tax expense (benefit) (209 ) 24,815 23,815 (25,024 ) 1,000 Net income (loss) $ (7,532 ) $ 38,404 $ 33,115 $ (45,936 ) $ 5,289 Gross nonregulated delivered gas sales volumes MMcf 446,903 420,203 441,081 26,700 (20,878 ) Consolidated nonregulated delivered gas sales volumes MMcf 384,799 353,853 370,569 30,946 (16,716 ) Net physical position (Bcf) 21.0 15.7 15.9 5.3 (0.2 ) (1) Net of storage fees of $15.2 million, $13.2 million and $10.8 million. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 Realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services were $78.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2011 compared with $78.1 million for the prior-year period. The increase primarily reflects the following: $1.4 million increase in margins from storage and transportation services, primarily attributable to new drilling projects in the Barnett Shale area. $0.6 million decrease in gas delivery and other services primarily due to lower per-unit margins partially offset by a nine percent increase in consolidated delivered gas sales volumes due to new customers in the power generation market. Per-unit margins were $0.13/Mcf in the current year compared with $0.14/Mcf in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in per-unit margins reflects the impact of increased competition and lower basis spreads. The $47.2 million decrease in realized asset optimization margins from the prior year primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of weak natural gas market fundamentals which provided fewer favorable trading opportunities. 50 Table of Contents Unrealized margins decreased $2.6 million in the current period compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the timing of year-over-year realized margins. Operating expenses decreased $5.0 million primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and ad valorem taxes. During fiscal 2011, our nonregulated segment recognized $30.3 million of non-cash asset impairment charges associated with two projects. In March 2011, we recorded a $19.3 million charge to substantially write off our investment in Fort Necessity. This project began in February 2008 when Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC, a subsidiary of AEH, announced plans to construct and operate a salt-cavern storage project in Franklin Parish, Louisiana. In March 2010, we entered into an option and acquisition agreement with a third party, which provided the third party with the exclusive option to develop the proposed Fort Necessity salt-dome natural gas storage project. In July 2010, we agreed with the third party to extend the option period to March 2011. In January 2011, the third party developer notified us that it did not plan to commence the activities required to allow it to exercise the option by March 2011; accordingly, the option was terminated. At that time, we evaluated our strategic alternatives and concluded the project returns did not meet our investment objectives. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded an $11.0 million non-cash charge to impair certain natural gas gathering assets of Atmos Gathering Company. The charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and the adverse impact of an ongoing lawsuit associated with the project. Interest charges decreased $6.6 million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings. Asset Optimization Activities AEH monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit, before related fees, that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments. This economic value, combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit. We define potential gross profit as the change in AEH gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned. This amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount. Therefore, it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income. There is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future. We consider this measure a non-GAAP financial measure as it is calculated using both forward-looking storage injection/withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information. This measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by GAAP measures alone. Because there is no assurance that the economic value or potential gross profit will be realized in the future, corresponding future GAAP amounts are not available. 51 Table of Contents The following table presents AEH economic value and its potential gross profit (loss) at September 30, 2011 and 2010. September 30 2011 2010 (In millions, unless otherwise noted) Economic value $ 4.9 $ (7.5 ) Associated unrealized losses 14.7 12.8 Subtotal 19.6 5.3 Related fees (1) (17.7 ) (10.6 ) Potential gross profit (loss) $ 1.9 $ (5.3 ) Net physical position (Bcf) 21.0 15.7 (1) Related fees represent the contractual costs to acquire the storage capacity utilized in our nonregulated segment asset optimization operations. The fees primarily consist of demand fees and contractual obligations to sell gas below market index in exchange for the right to manage and optimize third party storage assets for the positions we have entered into as of September 30, 2011 and 2010. During the 2011 fiscal year, our nonregulated segment economic value increased from a negative economic value of ($7.5) million, or ($0.48)/Mcf at September 30, 2010 to $4.9 million, or $0.23/Mcf at September 30, 2011. The increase in economic value was attributable to several factors including an increase in the captured spread value resulting from realizing financial instruments with lower spread values, entering into financial hedges with higher average prices and rolling financial instruments to forward periods to capture incremental value. Additionally, as a result of falling gas prices throughout the year, we injected a net 5.3 Bcf, which reduced the overall weighted average cost of gas held in storage. The economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors. Since AEH actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position, it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit as of September 30, 2011 will be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur. Further, if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions, our earnings could be adversely impacted. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 Realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services contributed 64 percent to total realized margins during fiscal 2010, with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 36 percent. In fiscal 2009, gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services represented 65 percent of the nonregulated segment realized margins with asset optimization contributing the remaining 35 percent. The $28.1 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected: $19.4 million decrease in gas delivery, storage and transportation services and other services as a result of narrowing basis spreads, combined with lower delivered sales volumes. Per-unit delivered gas margins were $0.14/Mcf in fiscal 2010, compared with $0.17/Mcf in fiscal 2009, while delivered gas volumes were 5 percent lower in fiscal 2010 when compared with fiscal 2009. $8.7 million decrease in asset optimization due to lower margins earned on storage optimization activities, lower basis gains earned from utilizing leased capacity and lower margins earned on asset management plans, partially offset by higher realized storage and trading gains during fiscal 2010. 52 Table of Contents The decrease in realized gross profit was offset by a $28.1 million increase in unrealized margins due to the period-over-period timing of storage withdrawal gains and the associated reversal of unrealized gains into realized gains. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes, and asset impairments decreased $5.1 million primarily due a decrease in employee and other administrative costs, partially offset by an increase in gas gathering activities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources, including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs in a cost-effective manner. We also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require. During fiscal 2011, we executed on our strategy of consolidating our short-term facilities used for our regulated operations into a single line of credit, including the following: On May 2, 2011, we replaced our five-year $566.7 million unsecured credit facility, due to expire in December 2011, with a five-year $750 million unsecured credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion. In December 2010, we replaced AEM $450 million 364-day facility with a $200 million, three-year facility. The reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low cost of gas and AEM ability to access an intercompany facility that was increased during fiscal 2011; however, this facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to $500 million. In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million 364-day revolving credit agreement with a $200 million 180-day revolving credit agreement that expired in April 2011. As planned, we did not replace or extend this agreement. As a result of these changes, we now have $985 million of availability from our commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with third parties. Our $350 million 7.375% senior notes were paid on their maturity date on May 15, 2011 using commercial paper borrowings. In effect, we refinanced this debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of $400 million 5.50% 30-year unsecured senior notes on June 10, 2011. On September 30, 2010, we entered into three Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing the anticipated issuances of senior notes. The Treasury locks were settled on June 7, 2011 with the receipt of $20.1 million from the counterparties due to an increase in the 30-year Treasury lock rates between inception of the Treasury lock and settlement. The effective interest rate on these notes is 5.381 percent, after giving effect to offering costs and the settlement of the $300 million Treasury locks. Substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately $394 million were used to repay $350 million of outstanding commercial paper. The remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. Additionally, we had planned to issue $250 million of 30-year unsecured notes in November 2011 to fund our capital expenditure program. In September 2010, we entered into two Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with the anticipated issuance of these senior notes, which were designated as cash flow hedges. Due primarily to stronger than anticipated cash flows primarily resulting from the extension of the Bush tax cuts that allow the continued use of bonus depreciation on qualifying expenditures through December 31, 2011, the need to issue $250 million of debt in November was eliminated and the related Treasury lock agreements were unwound. A pretax cash gain of approximately $28 million was recorded in March 2011. 53 Table of Contents Finally, we intend to refinance our $250 million unsecured 5.125% Senior Notes that mature in January 2013 through the issuance of $350 million 30-year unsecured notes. In August 2011, we entered into three Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with the anticipated issuances of these senior notes. We designated all of these Treasury locks as cash flow hedges. We believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities, combined with our operating cash flows, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2012. Cash Flows Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 582,844 $ 726,476 $ 919,233 $ (143,632 ) $ (192,757 ) Investing activities (627,386 ) (542,702 ) (517,201 ) (84,684 ) (25,501 ) Financing activities 44,009 (163,025 ) (337,546 ) 207,034 174,521 Change in cash and cash equivalents (533 ) 20,749 64,486 (21,282 ) (43,737 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 131,952 111,203 46,717 20,749 64,486 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 131,419 $ 131,952 $ 111,203 $ (533 ) $ 20,749 Cash flows from operating activities Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we generated operating cash flow of $582.8 million from operating activities compared with $726.5 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease reflects the absence of an $85 million income tax refund received in the prior year coupled with the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and other net working capital changes. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we generated operating cash flow of $726.5 million from operating activities compared with $919.2 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to the fluctuation in gas costs. Gas costs, which reached historically high levels during the 2008 injection season, declined sharply when the economy slipped into the recession and have remained relatively stable since that time. Operating cash flows for the fiscal 2010 period reflect the recovery of lower gas costs through purchased gas recovery mechanisms 54 Table of Contents and sales. This is in contrast to the fiscal 2009 period, where operating cash flows were favorably influenced by the recovery of high gas costs during a period of falling prices. Cash flows from investing activities In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems. Our ongoing construction program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. In executing our current rate strategy, we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system. Currently, our Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution divisions and our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case. In early fiscal 2010, two coalitions of cities, representing the majority of the cities our Mid-Tex Division serves, agreed to a program of installing, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, 100,000 steel service line replacements during fiscal 2011 and 2012, with approved recovery of the associated return, depreciation and taxes. During fiscal 2011, we replaced 35,852 lines for a cost of $49.7 million. The program is progressing on schedule for completion in September 2012. As a result of this project and spending to replace our regulated customer service systems and our nonregulated energy trading risk management system, we anticipate capital expenditures will remain elevated during the next fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we incurred $623.0 million for capital expenditures compared with $542.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 and $509.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009. The $80.4 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the Mid-Tex Division, the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and the construction of a new customer contact center in Amarillo, Texas, partially offset by costs incurred in the prior fiscal year to relocate the company information technology data center. The $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily reflects spending for the relocation of our information technology data center to a new facility, the construction of two service centers and the steel service line replacement program in our Mid-Tex Division. Cash flows from financing activities For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, our financing activities generated $44.0 million in cash, while financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 used $163.0 million in cash compared with cash of $337.5 million used for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009. Our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows: 2011 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we: Received $394.5 million net cash proceeds in June 2011 related to the issuance of $400 million 5.50% senior notes due 2041. Borrowed a net $83.3 million under our short-term facilities to fund working capital needs. Received $27.8 million cash in March 2011 related to the unwinding of two Treasury locks. Received $20.1 million cash in June 2011 related to the settlement of three Treasury locks associated with the $400 million 5.50% senior notes offering. Received $7.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 0.3 million shares of common stock. 55 Table of Contents Paid $360.1 million for scheduled long-term debt repayments, including our $350 million 7.375% senior notes that were paid on their maturity date on May 15, 2011. Paid $124.0 million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of 60 percent of net income. Paid $5.3 million for the repurchase of equity awards. 2010 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we: Paid $124.3 million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of 61 percent of net income. Paid $100.5 million for the repurchase of common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Borrowed a net $54.3 million under our short-term facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases. Received $8.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 0.4 million shares of common stock, which is a 68 percent decrease compared to the prior year due primarily to the fact that beginning in fiscal 2010 shares were purchased on the open market rather than being issued by us to the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. Paid $1.2 million to repurchase equity awards. 2009 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we: Paid $407.4 million to repay our $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes. Repaid a net $284.0 million short-term borrowings under our credit facilities. Paid $121.5 million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of 64 percent of net income. Received $445.6 million in net proceeds related to the March 2009 issuance of $450 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019. The net proceeds were used to repay the $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes. Received $27.7 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 1.2 million shares of common stock. Received $1.9 million net proceeds related to the settlement of the Treasury lock agreement associated with the March 2009 issuance of the $450 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019. The following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2011 2010 2009 Shares issued: Direct stock purchase plan 103,529 407,262 Retirement savings plan 79,722 640,639 1998 Long-term incentive plan 675,255 421,706 686,046 Outside directors stock-for-fee plan 2,385 3,382 3,079 Total shares issued 677,640 608,339 1,737,026 The number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects an increased number of shares issued under our 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan due to the exercise of stock options during the current fiscal year. This increase was partially offset by the fact that we 56 Table of Contents are purchasing shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. During fiscal 2011, we cancelled and retired 169,793 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 375,468 shares attributable to our 2010 accelerated share repurchase agreement described below, which are not included in the table above. The year-over-year decrease in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2009, primarily reflects the fact that in fiscal 2010, we began to purchase shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. Further, a higher average stock price during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010 compared to the second and third quarters of 2009 enabled us to issue fewer shares during fiscal 2010. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, we cancelled and retired 37,365 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 2,958,580 common shares as part of our 2010 accelerated share repurchase agreement described below, which are not included in the table above. Share Repurchase Agreement On, July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. under which we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding common stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various employee and director incentive compensation plans. We paid $100 million to Goldman Sachs & Co. on July 7, 2010 for shares of Atmos Energy common stock in a share forward transaction and received 2,958,580 shares. On March 4, 2011, we received and retired an additional 375,468 common shares, which concluded our share repurchase agreement. In total, we received and retired 3,334,048 common shares under the repurchase agreement. The final number of shares we ultimately repurchased in the transaction was based generally on the average of the effective share repurchase price of our common stock over the duration of the agreement, which was $29.99. As a result of this transaction, beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the number of outstanding shares used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the number of shares received and the $100 million purchase price was recorded as a reduction in shareholders equity. Share Repurchase Program On September 28, 2011 the Board of Directors approved a new program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares of common stock over a five-year period. Although the program is authorized for a five-year period, it may be terminated or limited at any time. Shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts the company deems appropriate. The program is primarily intended to minimize the dilutive effect of equity grants under various benefit related incentive compensation plans of the company. Credit Facilities Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements. However, our short-term borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter months. As of September 30, 2011, we financed our short-term borrowing requirements through a combination of a $750.0 million commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders that provided $985 million of working capital funding. As of September 30, 2011, the amount available to us under our credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $702.5 million. These facilities are described in further detail in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. On May 2, 2011, we replaced our five-year $566.7 million unsecured credit facility, due to expire in December 2011, with a five-year $750 million unsecured credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion. 57 Table of Contents In December 2010, we replaced AEM $450 million 364-day facility with a $200 million, three-year facility. The reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low cost of gas and AEM ability to access an intercompany facility that was increased in fiscal 2011; however, this facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to $500 million. In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million 364-day revolving credit agreement with a $200 million 180-day revolving credit agreement that expired in April 2011. As planned, we did not replace or extend this agreement. Shelf Registration We have an effective shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that permits us to issue a total of $1.3 billion in common stock and/or debt securities. The shelf registration statement has been approved by all requisite state regulatory commissions. Due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the new registration statement, we were able to issue a total of $950 million in debt securities and $350 million in equity securities. At September 30, 2011, $900 million was available for issuance. Of this amount, $550 million is available for the issuance of debt securities and $350 million remains available for the issuance of equity securities under the shelf until March 2013. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate. Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard & Poor Corporation (S&P), Moody Investors Service (Moody s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). On May 11, 2011, Moody upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2, with a ratings outlook of stable, citing steady rate increases, improving credit metrics and a strategic focus on lower risk regulated activities as reasons for the upgrade. On June 2, 2011, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to A- from BBB+, with a ratings outlook of stable, citing a constructive regulatory environment, strategic focus on lower risk regulated activities and the geographic diversity of our regulated operations as key rating factors. As of September 30, 2011, S&P maintained a stable outlook. Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows: S&P Moody Fitch Unsecured senior long-term debt BBB+ Baa1 A- Commercial paper A-2 P-2 F-2 A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S&P, Aaa for Moody and AAA for Fitch. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB-for S&P, Baa3 for Moody and BBB- for Fitch. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. 58 Table of Contents Debt Covenants We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2011. Our debt covenants are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Capitalization The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2011 and 2010: September 30 2011 2010 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt $ 206,396 4.4 % $ 126,100 2.8 % Long-term debt 2,208,551 47.3 % 2,169,682 48.5 % Shareholders equity 2,255,421 48.3 % 2,178,348 48.7 % Total capitalization, including short-term debt $ 4,670,368 100.0 % $ 4,474,130 100.0 % Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 51.7 percent and 51.3 percent at September 30, 2011 and 2010. The increase in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in short-term debt as of September 30, 2011 compared to the prior year. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to continue to maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2011. Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Long-term debt (1) $ 2,212,565 $ 2,434 $ 250,131 $ 500,000 $ 1,460,000 Short-term debt (1) 206,396 206,396 Interest charges (2) 1,574,702 136,452 250,841 198,596 988,813 Gas purchase commitments (3) 460,179 274,985 185,194 Capital lease obligations (4) 1,194 186 372 372 264 Operating leases (4) 199,567 17,718 33,365 30,376 118,108 Demand fees for contracted storage (5) 19,339 11,421 6,770 983 165 Demand fees for contracted transportation (6) 37,295 13,941 19,929 3,425 Financial instrument obligations (7) 93,542 15,453 78,089 Postretirement benefit plan contributions (8) 194,323 31,519 28,543 35,122 99,139 Total contractual obligations $ 4,999,102 $ 710,505 $ 853,234 $ 768,874 $ 2,666,489 (1) See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Interest charges were calculated using the stated rate for each debt issuance. (3) Gas purchase commitments were determined based upon contractually determined volumes at prices estimated based upon the index specified in the contract, adjusted for estimated basis differentials and contractual discounts as of September 30, 2011. 59 Table of Contents (4) See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (5) Represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our nonregulated segment. Contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our natural gas distribution segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms. (6) Represents third party contractual demand fees for transportation in our nonregulated segment. (7) Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity financial instruments that were valued as of September 30, 2011. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled. The table above excludes $1.3 million of current liabilities from risk management activities that are classified as liabilities held for sale in conjunction with the sale of our Iowa, Illinois and Missouri operations. (8) Represents expected contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. AEH has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2011, AEH was committed to purchase 103.3 Bcf within one year, 46.4 Bcf within one to three years and 0.9 Bcf after three years under indexed contracts. AEH is committed to purchase 4.2 Bcf within one year and 0.3 Bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.49 to $6.36 per Mcf. With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments under these contract terms as of September 30, 2011 are reflected in the table above. Risk Management Activities We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In our nonregulated segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings. We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the commodity price risk in our nonregulated segment associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our nonregulated segment. Also, in our nonregulated segment, we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not been designated as hedges. 60 Table of Contents We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices. The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 (in thousands): Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2010 $ (49,600 ) Contracts realized/settled (51,136 ) Fair value of new contracts 2,584 Other changes in value 18,875 Fair value of contracts at September 30, 2011 $ (79,277 ) The fair value of our natural gas distribution segment financial instruments at September 30, 2011, is presented below by time period and fair value source: Fair Value of Contracts at September 30, 2011 Maturity in years Less Greater Total Fair Source of Fair Value Than 1 1-3 4-5 Than 5 Value (In thousands) Prices actively quoted $ (12,413 ) $ (66,864 ) $ $ $ (79,277 ) Prices based on models and other valuation methods Total Fair Value $ (12,413 ) $ (66,864 ) $ $ $ (79,277 ) The tables above include $1.3 million of current liabilities from risk management activities that are classified as liabilities held for sale in conjunction with the sale of our Iowa, Illinois and Missouri operations.

These programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs. Medical and Dental Insurance We offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees, and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry. Since 2005, we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately seven percent. In recent years, we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices. In March 2010, President Obama signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law (the Health Care Reform Act ). The Health Care Reform Act will be phased in over an eight-year period. Although we are still assessing the impact of the Health Care Reform Act on the health care benefits we provide to our employees, the design of our health care plans has already changed in order to comply with provisions of the Health Care Reform Act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in fiscal 2012. For example, lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated, coverage for dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer. In 2014, health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals. Companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage. However, companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange. We will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations. For fiscal 2012, we anticipate an approximate 10 percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate, primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the Health Care Reform Act. Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was $56.6 million, compared with $50.8 million and $50.2 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. These costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense. Our fiscal 2011 costs were determined using a September 30, 2010 measurement date. As of September 30, 2010, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were significantly higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of September 30, 2009, the measurement date for our fiscal 2010 net periodic cost. Accordingly, we decreased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2011 pension and benefit costs to 5.39 percent. Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25 percent. Accordingly, our fiscal 2011 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year. The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the decline in fair value of our plan assets. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2009 measurement date, the interest rates were slightly lower than the interest rates at September 30, 2008, the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost. Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25 percent. 62 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. In accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), we determined the funded status of our plans as of January 1, 2011. Based on this valuation, we were required to contribute cash of $0.9 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2011. The need for this funding reflects the decline in the fair value of the plans assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during 2008 and 2009. This contribution will increase the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable PPA funding threshold. During fiscal 2010, we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the PPA. During fiscal 2009, we contributed $21.0 million to our pension plans to achieve the same desired level of funding as established by the PPA. We contributed $11.3 million, $11.8 million and $10.1 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. Outlook for Fiscal 2012 and Beyond As of September 30, 2011, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates, which impacted our fiscal 2012 net periodic pension and postretirement costs, were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of September 30, 2010, the measurement date for our fiscal 2011 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2012 pension and benefit costs to 5.05 percent. We reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets to 7.75 percent, based on historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation. Although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined, the impact of this decline is partially mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our Pension Account Plan, our largest funded plan. Due to the decrease in our discount rate and our expected return on plan assets as well as the decline in the fair value of our plan assets, we expect our fiscal 2012 pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal 2011. Based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30, 2011 the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we anticipate contributing between $25 million and $30 million to the Plans in fiscal 2012. Further, we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds. With respect to our postretirement medical plans, we anticipate contributing approximately $32 million during fiscal 2012. The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan. In August 2010, the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved a proposal to close the Pension Account Plan (PAP) to new participants, effective October 1, 2010. Employees participating in the PAP as of October 1, 2010 were allowed to make a one-time election to migrate from the PAP into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features, effective January 1, 2011. Participants who chose to remain in the PAP will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits. 63 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
