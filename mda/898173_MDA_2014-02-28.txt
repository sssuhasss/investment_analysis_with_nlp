OVERVIEW We are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customers and professional service providers our dual market strategy . Our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer. For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects good , better , and best alternatives. Our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products. Consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry. Our stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers: used oil, oil filter and battery recycling; battery, wiper and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops. As of December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states. Operating within the retail industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including, but not limited to, fuel costs, unemployment rates, consumer preferences and spending habits, and competition. The difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact O Reilly and the retail sector in general. We believe that the average consumer tendency has been to trade down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences; however, we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum. 24 We believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers willingness to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the U.S. economy recovers; however, we cannot predict whether, when, or the manner in which, these economic conditions will change. We believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, new light vehicle registrations, average vehicle age and unemployment. Number of Miles Driven - The number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. According to the Department of Transportation, prior to 2007, the annual number of total miles driven in the U.S. had steadily increased; however, since that time, as the U.S. experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions and historically high levels of unemployment, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. have remained relatively flat. Although total miles driven have not significantly increased since 2007, vehicles in the U.S. continue to be driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and continued demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket. In addition, we believe that as the U.S. economy continues to recover and the level of unemployment declines, total miles driven in the U.S. will return to a period of annual growth, supporting continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. Number of U.S. Registered Vehicles, New Light Vehicle Registrations and Average Vehicle Age - The total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry. As reported by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association ( AAIA ), the total number of registered vehicles has increased 8% over the past decade, from 229 million light vehicles in 2002 to 247 million light vehicles in 2012. Annual new light vehicle registrations declined 14% over the past decade, from 16.7 million registrations in 2002 to 14.3 million registrations in 2012; however, the seasonally adjusted annual rate (the SAAR ) of sales of light vehicles in the U.S. increased to 15 million as of December 31, 2013, indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed. In addition, during the past decade, vehicle scrappage rates remained relatively stable, ranging from just 4.6% to 5.7% annually. The stable scrappage rates over the past decade have contributed to an increase in the average age of the U.S. vehicle population over that period, growing 16% , from 9.6 years in 2002 to 11.1 years in 2012. We believe this increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors, and the consumer willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles. As the average age of the vehicle on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty. These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles. As the U.S. economy recovers, we believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. Unemployment - Unemployment, underemployment, the threat of future joblessness and the continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the U.S. have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. Long-term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven, as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending, both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry. However, as of December 31, 2013, the U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 6.7% , its lowest rate in over five years. We believe that as the economy continues to recover, unemployment rates should decline and we would expect to see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work. Aided by the anticipated increase in commuter miles, we believe overall annual U.S. miles driven should return to a period of annual growth, resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. KEY EVENTS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below: Under the Company share repurchase program, as approved by the Board of Directors in January of 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. The Company and its Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. The Company Board of Directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, which was announced on May 29, 2013, and an additional $500 million, which was announced on February 5, 2014, raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to $ 4.0 billion . These additional $ 500 million authorizations are effective for a three-year period following 25 their respective announcement dates. As of February 28, 2014, we had repurchased approximately 40.6 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $ 3.4 billion under this program. On June 20, 2013, the Company issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 ( 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 ) at a price to the public of 99.992% of their face value with United Missouri Bank, N.A. ( UMB ) as trustee. Interest on the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which began on December 15, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year. On July 2, 2013, the Company amended its credit agreement, which it entered into in January of 2011. The amendment lowered the maximum borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility to $ 600 million , extended the maturity date of the credit agreement to July of 2018 and lowered the interest rate margins on borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility and facility fees applicable to the commitments thereunder. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table includes income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold, including warehouse and distribution expenses 49.3 49.9 51.0 Gross profit 50.7 50.1 49.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 34.1 34.3 34.1 Former CSK officer clawback (0.1 ) Operating income 16.6 15.8 15.0 Interest expense (0.7 ) (0.7 ) (0.5 ) Interest income 0.1 0.1 Write-off of asset-based revolving credit facility debt issuance costs (0.4 ) Termination of interest rate swap agreements (0.1 ) Income before income taxes 15.9 15.2 14.1 Provision for income taxes 5.8 5.7 5.3 Net income 10.1 % 9.5 % 8.8 % 2013 Compared to 2012 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased $ 467 million to $ 6.65 billion from $ 6.18 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 8% . Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 4.3% and 3.8% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, sales to Team Members and sales from the VIP Parts, Tires & Service ("VIP") stores acquired on December 31, 2012, due to the significant change in the business model and lack of historical data. 26 The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2013, Compared to the Same Period in 2012 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 259 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2012, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 74 Sales in 2012 for stores that have closed (3 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2013 and acquired VIP stores 134 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 3 Total increase in sales $ 467 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of store growth and the high levels of customer service provided by our well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, superior inventory availability, enhanced services and programs offered in most stores, a broader selection of product offerings in most stores with a dynamic catalog system to identify and source parts, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2013, was driven by an increase in average ticket values for both DIY and commercial business, and an increase in customer transaction counts for commercial business, slightly offset by a small decrease in customer transaction counts for DIY business. The improvements in average ticket values were the result of the continued growth of the more costly hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales. The growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their existing vehicles. The increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts were driven by the chainwide growth of our professional business, while macroeconomic pressures on disposable income continue to negatively impact DIY customer transaction counts. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is, on average, greater. We opened 190 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 180 net, new stores and 56 acquired stores for the year ended December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, we operated 4,166 stores in 42 states compared to 3,976 stores in 42 states at December 31, 2012. We anticipate new store unit growth to increase to 200 net, new stores in 2014. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 3.37 billion (or 50.7% of sales) from $ 3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% . The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores and sales from new stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to acquisition cost improvements, improved inventory shrinkage and distribution system efficiencies, partially offset by a smaller amount of capitalized distribution costs in the current year, the non-cash impact to gross margin resulting from the depletion of our last-in, first-out ("LIFO") reserve and the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of our total sales mix. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks. Distribution system efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. The decrease in capitalized distribution costs in the current year is the result of the larger than typical benefit from capitalized distribution costs in the prior year associated with our initiative to increase our store-level inventories. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores in the prior year were more efficient than routine restocking activity; as a result, we realized a larger than normal benefit from capitalized distribution costs. The depletion of our LIFO reserve during the year resulted from the acquisition cost improvements we have realized over time. The Company's policy is not to write up inventory in excess of replacement cost and, accordingly, we are now effectively valuing our inventory at replacement cost. During 2013, our LIFO cost was written down by approximately $21.6 million to reflect replacement cost. We expect to incur pressure from product acquisition cost reductions in the first quarter of 2014; however, at this time, we do not anticipate material charges for the last three quarters of 2014. Unforeseen significant acquisition cost decreases could occur and may create additional LIFO gross margin headwinds during 2014. 27 Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, outsized growth, as compared to DIY, creates pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 2.27 billion (or 34.1% of sales) from $ 2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7% . The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of improved leverage of store payroll and occupancy costs on strong comparable store sales results. Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 1.10 billion (or 16.6% of sales) from $ 977 million (or 15.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13% . Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 45 million (or 0.7% of sales), from $ 36 million (or 0.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 24% . The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily due to increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 389 million ( 36.7% effective tax rate) from $ 356 million ( 37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9% . The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. The decrease in our tax rate was primarily due to the benefits of employment tax credits realized in the current year, adjustments to tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits during the current year and unfavorable adjustments relating to certain income tax audits in the prior year. Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased to $ 670 million (or 10.1% of sales), from $ 586 million (or 9.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 14% . Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013, increased 27% to $ 6.03 on 111 million shares from $ 4.75 on 123 million shares for the same period one year ago. 2012 Compared to 2011 Sales: Sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased $393 million to $6.18 billion from $5.79 billion for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 3.8% and 4.6% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members. The following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 (in millions): Increase in Sales for the Year Ended December 31, 2012, Compared to the Same Period in 2011 Store sales: Comparable store sales $ 215 Non-comparable store sales: Sales for stores opened throughout 2011, excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales 78 Sales in 2011 for stores that have closed (3 ) Sales for stores opened throughout 2012 96 Non-store sales: Includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and Team Members 7 Total increase in sales $ 393 28 We believe the increased sales achieved by our stores were the result of high levels of customer service, superior inventory availability, a broader selection of products offered in most stores, a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events, continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores, compensation programs for all store Team Members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both DIY and professional service provider customers. Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2012, was driven by an increase in average ticket values, partially offset by a decrease in DIY customer transaction counts. The improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly, hard part categories, as a percentage of our total sales. The growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in DIY hard part sales, as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles. The strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts, driven by our acquired markets, have been offset by pressured DIY transaction counts. DIY customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income, including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages. Both DIY and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles, which have been manufactured in recent years. These vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time; however, when repairs are required, the cost of the repair is typically greater. We opened 180 net, new stores and acquired 56 stores during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 170 net, new stores for the year ended December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, we operated 3,976 stores in 42 states compared to 3,740 stores in 39 states at December 31, 2011. Gross profit: Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $3.10 billion (or 50.1% of sales) from $2.84 billion (or 49.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to DC efficiencies, acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage, partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix. DC efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced DC Team Members in our maturing DCs. In addition, during 2012 we increased our store-level inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels. The costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and, as a result, we realized a one-time benefit from capitalized distribution costs. This capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points versus the prior year. Acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs. The improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks. Commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than DIY sales, as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers, therefore, creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $2.12 billion (or 34.3% of sales) from $1.97 billion (or 34.1% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. The increase in total SG&A dollars was primarily the result of additional employees, facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count. The slight increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industry-leading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment, as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales. Operating income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $867 million (or 15.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 13%. Other income and expense: Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, decreased to $36 million (or 0.6% of sales), from $51 million (or 0.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing a decrease of 30%. The decrease in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to one-time charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in January of 2011 (discussed in detail below), partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year. Income taxes: Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $356 million (37.8% effective tax rate) from $308 million (37.8% effective tax rate) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%. The increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income. 29 Net income: As a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales), from $508 million (or 8.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 15%. Earnings per share: Our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 28% to $4.75 on 123 million shares from $3.71 on 137 million shares for the same period one year ago. Adjustments for nonrecurring and non-operating events: Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the SEC and a former CSK officer that resulted in the reimbursement to O Reilly, as successor issuer to CSK for SEC purposes, of $3 million ($2 million, net of tax) of incentive-based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer. This clawback amount was included in Operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2011, also included one-time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on January 14, 2011. The one-time charges included a non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million ($13 million, net of tax) and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of $4 million ($3 million, net of tax). The charges related to our new financing transactions were included in Other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. The results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the subsequent table. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 13% to $977 million (or 15.8% of sales) from $864 million (or 14.9% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 12% to $586 million (or 9.5% of sales) from $522 million (or 9.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased 25% to $4.75 from $3.81 for the same period one year ago.

We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs, the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts, and the former CSK officer clawback, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, which is indicative of our core operations. We exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information 30 is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the table above, the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program. The primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Additionally, decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Liquidity and related ratios: The following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in millions): December 31, Percentage Liquidity and Related Ratios 2013 2012 Change Current assets $ 2,835 $ 2,733 3.7 % Current liabilities 2,423 2,273 6.6 % Working capital (1) 412 460 (10.4 )% Total debt 1,396 1,096 27.4 % Total equity 1,966 2,108 (6.7 )% Debt to equity (2) 0.71:1 0.52:1 36.5 % (1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. (2) Debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. Current liabilities increased 7% , total debt increased 27% and total equity decreased 7% from 2012 to 2013. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year, which allowed us to obtain more favorable payment terms. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6% as of December 31, 2013, as compared to 84.7% one year prior. The increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of $300 million of 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023. The decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year. The following table identifies cash provided by/(used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, Liquidity 2013 2012 2011 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 908,026 $ 1,251,555 $ 1,118,991 Investing activities (388,754 ) (317,407 ) (319,653 ) Financing activities (536,082 ) (1,047,572 ) (467,507 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (16,810 ) $ (113,424 ) $ 331,831 Capital expenditures $ 395,881 $ 300,719 $ 328,319 Free cash flow (a) 512,145 950,836 790,672 (a) Calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for the period. Operating activities: The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a smaller decrease in net inventory investment and a smaller increase in income taxes payable, offset in part by an increase in net income for the year. Net inventory 31 investment reflects our investment in inventory, net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors. Our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs. Our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 86.6% , 84.7% and 64.4% at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The smaller increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio in 2013 is the result of a smaller increase in the number of new vendors added to our financing programs in the current year versus the prior year. We launched our enhanced vendor financing program in January of 2011, and were able to add a large number of vendors to the programs during 2011 and 2012. As we anniversary these vendor additions to the programs, we expect to see a slower rate of growth in our accounts payable to inventory ratio. The smaller increase in income taxes payable was primarily the result of a prepaid tax position at the beginning of 2012 versus a payable position at the beginning of 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year (adjusted for the effect of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges and the one-time, non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility in January of 2011), decreases in net inventory and other assets and increases in income taxes payable (adjusted for the effect of non-cash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised) and other current liabilities. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 84.7%, 64.4% and 44.3% at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the Company under various programs. The increase in income taxes payable, adjusted for the non-cash impacts discussed above, was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during 2011. The increase in other current liabilities was primarily the result of the payment, during 2011, for the one-time monetary penalty to the DOJ for the legacy CSK DOJ investigation. Investing activities: The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures during the current year related to the purchase and construction of new distribution facilities during 2013 to support our ongoing store growth. The total capital expenditures were $396 million and $301 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during 2012, partially offset by small acquisitions during the year. Total capital expenditures were $301 million and $328 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures during 2012, as compared to 2011, was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened. We were able to find real estate with attractive lease rates during 2012 and as a result, opened a larger number of leased locations during 2012 as compared to the year prior. Opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location. We opened 190 , 180, and 170 net, new stores in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, and acquired 56 stores in 2012. We plan to open 200 net, new stores in 2014. The costs associated with the opening of a new store (including the cost of land acquisition, improvements, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment and computer equipment) are estimated to average approximately $ 1.3 million to $ 1.5 million ; however, such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site. Financing activities: The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily attributable to the impact of fewer share repurchases of our common stock during the current year, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during 2012, in accordance with our Board-approved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt during 2011, partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the Company incentive programs and the related tax benefits during 2012. Credit facilities: On January 14, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a five-year $ 750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") arranged by Bank of America, N.A. and Barclays Capital, originally scheduled to mature in January of 2016. During 2011, we completed our first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $ 660 million , extending the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to September of 2016 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In conjunction with the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time charge related to the modification in the amount of $ 0.3 million , which is included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. In July of 2013, we completed our second amendment to the Credit Agreement, decreasing the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $ 600 million , extending the maturity date on the Credit Agreement to July of 2018 and reducing the facility fee and interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement includes a $ 200 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $ 75 million sub-limit for swing line borrowings. As described in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, we may, from time to time subject to certain conditions, increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $ 200 million . We had outstanding stand-by letters of credit, primarily to support obligations 32 related to workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies, in the amount of $ 52 million and $ 57 million as of December 13, 2013 and 2012, respectively, reducing the aggregate availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by those amounts. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. On July 11, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement for a five-year asset-based revolving credit facility (the "ABL Credit Facility"), which was scheduled to mature in July of 2013. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $356 million under the ABL Credit Facility, of which $106 million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract. All outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility were repaid, and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on January 14, 2011, and the ABL Credit Facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021, as further described below. In conjunction with the retirement of our ABL Credit Facility, we recognized a one-time non-cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the ABL Credit Facility in the amount of $22 million and a one-time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of $4 million, which are included in Other income (expense) on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Senior Notes: 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021: On January 14, 2011 , we issued $ 500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.297% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on January 14 and July 14 of each year, which began on July 14, 2011, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021: On September 19, 2011 , we issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ( 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ) at a price to the public of 99.826% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which began on March 15, 2012, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year. 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022: On August 21, 2012 , we issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ( 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 ) at a price to the public of 99.627% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 3.800% Senior Notes due 2022 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, which began on March 1, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year. 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023: On June 20, 2013 , we issued $ 300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 ( 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 ) at a price to the public of 99.992% of their face value with UMB as trustee. Interest on the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which began on December 15, 2013, and is computed on the basis of a 360 -day year. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023 were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. The senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Guarantors ) that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our other debt or any of our Subsidiary Guarantors. The guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, including release of the subsidiary guarantor guarantee under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt, or, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in, or of all or substantially all the property of, the subsidiary guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries. Our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be Subsidiary Guarantors would be minor subsidiaries. Neither we, nor any of our Subsidiary Guarantors, are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries, except as provided by applicable law. Each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants, with which we complied as of December 31, 2013. Debt covenants: The indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt; (ii) enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property, in each case as set forth in the indentures. These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.25 times through December 31, 2014, and 2.50 times thereafter through maturity, and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 times through maturity. The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and stock-based compensation expense ( EBITDAR ). Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, 33 outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, six-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt. In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of credit extensions, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and litigation from our lenders. We had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.98 times and 4.95 times as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.90 times and 1.83 times as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements. Under our current financing plan, we have targeted an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio range of 2.00 times to 2.25 times. The table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 GAAP net income $ 670,292 $ 585,746 Add: Interest expense 49,074 40,200 Rent expense 254,892 240,869 Provision for income taxes 388,650 355,775 Depreciation expense 183,220 176,705 Amortization (benefit) expense (40 ) 401 Non-cash share-based compensation 21,722 22,026 Non-GAAP adjusted net income (EBITDAR) $ 1,567,810 $ 1,421,722 Interest expense $ 49,074 $ 40,200 Capitalized interest 10,644 6,064 Rent expense 254,892 240,869 Total fixed charges $ 314,610 $ 287,133 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 4.98 4.95 GAAP debt $ 1,396,208 $ 1,095,956 Stand-by letters of credit 51,715 57,281 Discount on senior notes 3,890 4,366 Six-times rent expense 1,529,352 1,445,214 Non-GAAP adjusted debt $ 2,981,165 $ 2,602,817 Consolidated leverage ratio 1.90 1.83 The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio discussed and presented in the table above are not derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. We believe that the presentation of our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement. We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as well. Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts. We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Share repurchase program: Under our share repurchase program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of our common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions. We may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice. During 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a resolution to increase the cumulative authorization amount by $ 500 million , which is effective for a three-year period and 34 expires May 29, 2016. As of December 31, 2013, the cumulative authorization amount under the program was $ 3.5 billion . On February 5, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a resolution to increase the cumulative authorization amount by an additional $ 500 million , which is effective for a three-year period and expires February 5, 2017. As of February 5, 2014, the cumulative authorization amount under the program was $ 4.0 billion . The following table identifies shares of the Company common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program (in thousands, except per share data): For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Shares repurchased 8,529 16,201 Average price per share $ 109.38 $ 89.20 Total investment $ 932,900 $ 1,445,044 As of December 31, 2013, we had $ 146 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 28, 2014, we did not repurchase a material number of shares of our common stock. We repurchased a total of 41 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in January of 2011 and through February 28, 2014, at an average price of $ 82.61 for a total aggregate investment of $ 3.4 billion . As of February 28, 2014, we had approximately $ 645 million remaining under our share repurchase program. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements, interest payments related to long-term debt, future payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in Note 6 Leasing and Note 13 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Deferred income taxes, as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory, are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment cancellation terms. Due to the absence of scheduled maturities, the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2014, which are included in Current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments Due By Period Total Before 1 Year Years 1 and 2 Years 3 and 4 Years 5 and Over (In thousands) Contractual Obligations: Long-term debt principal and interest payments (1) $ 1,905,981 $ 61,200 $ 122,400 $ 122,400 $ 1,599,981 Future minimum lease payments under capital leases (2) 103 77 26 Future minimum lease payments under operating leases (2) 1,941,490 247,126 445,887 355,336 893,141 Other obligations 1,800 600 1,200 Self-insurance reserves (3) 126,715 57,700 38,292 17,805 12,918 Construction commitments 80,803 80,803 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,056,892 $ 447,506 $ 607,805 $ 495,541 $ 2,506,040 (1) Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $ 600 million and matures in July of 2018, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate (both as defined in the agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.975% to 1.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate and 0.000% to 0.600% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above. In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.150% to 0.400% based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions. Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Base Rate loans is 0.000% , our margin for Eurodollar Rate loans is 0.975% and our facility fee is 0.150% . As of December 31, 2013, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 35 (2) The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments. (3) We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits. The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount. The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, including estimated interest and penalties, which are fully disclosed in Note 16 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined. As of December 31, 2013, we recorded a liability of $ 59 million related to these uncertain tax positions on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which was included as a component of Other liabilities . OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Off-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have historically utilized various off-balance sheet financial instruments, including sale-leaseback and synthetic lease transactions, but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off-balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements, operations or growth plans. We issue stand-by letters of credit provided by a $ 200 million sub limit under the Revolving Credit Facility that reduce our available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation, general liability and other insurance policies. Substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one-year term from the date of issuance. Letters of credit totaling $ 52 million and $ 57 million were outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Other than in connection with executing operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See Contractual Obligations and Note 13 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our operating leases. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management. Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates. Management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material. Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink Inventory, which consists of automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and tools, is stated at the lower of cost or market. The extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal. The products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and, accordingly, have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand. We do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost. This reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate, at a given point in time, the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods. Ultimately, our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances. We have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future. We also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink. We estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic, full physical inventories. To the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage, we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory 36 balances. We have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates. If unrecorded shrink changed 10% from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. Accounts Receivable We provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors. Actual results have consistently been within management expectations, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts. However, if actual results differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to losses or gains. If the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed 10% from our estimated allowance at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill - We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment. A potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The estimate of cash flows includes management assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long-term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates, which could materially impact our impairment assessment. We review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our Company using the market approach. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates, including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs; however, we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of December 31, 2013, nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing. If the price of O Reilly stock, which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing, changed by 10% from the value used during testing, the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required. Vendor Concessions We receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including co-operative advertising, allowances for warranties, merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates. Co-operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program, specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes, are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred. All other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory. Amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns. Management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations. Based on our historical results and current assessment, we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations. The eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Warranty Reserves We offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from 30 days to limited lifetime warranties. The risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our vendors. Certain vendors provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims. For this merchandise, when sold, we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims. Differences between vendor allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales. Estimated warranty costs, which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale, are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line. Our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims. If warranty reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 3 million or 0.3% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. 37 Self-Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits. With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability or property loss claim. When estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, and growth patterns and exposure forecasts. The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations. Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities. Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains. As we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information. These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value, using a credit-adjusted discount rate. These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns. We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities. If self-insurance reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 12 million or 1.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. Closed Property Reserves We maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations. We accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit-adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non-cancelable lease payments, contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date, net of estimated sublease income. The closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms. We estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. If closed property reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 1 million or 0.1% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. Legal Reserves We maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which O Reilly is currently involved. We are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business. We resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against CSK Auto Corporation ("CSK") and certain of CSK former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the 2008 acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition, we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations, litigation and indemnity obligations. Our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of CSK. Management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures. If legal reserves were changed 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013, the financial impact would have been approximately $ 2 million or 0.2% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2013. Taxes We operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit. The amount of such liabilities is based on various factors, such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority, experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and/or changes in tax regulations. In management opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented. The estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates. Alternatively, we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position. While our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion, our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY For the last three fiscal years, we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry-wide, we have typically been able 38 to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations. To some extent, our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July of 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ( ASU 2013-11 ). Under ASU 2013-11, an entity is required to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. If a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. ASU 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We will adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ending March 31, 2014; the application of this guidance affects presentation only and, therefore, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 39
