Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this report in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. OVERVIEW Anadarko achieved its key operational objectives in 2011 by increasing sales volumes by approximately 6% year-over-year and adding 392 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved reserves. Additionally, the Company continued its offshore exploration and appraisal drilling success with an approximate 80% success rate for wells completed in 2011. Anadarko ended 2011 with $2.7 billion cash on hand and $2.1 billion available under its five-year $5.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility ($5.0 billion Facility), as well as additional access to credit and capital markets as needed. Management believes that the Company is positioned to satisfy its operational objectives and capital commitments with cash on hand, available borrowing capacity, and cash flows from operations. Mission and Strategy Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring, and developing oil and natural-gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: identify and commercialize resources; explore in high-potential, proven basins; employ a global business development approach; and ensure financial discipline and flexibility. Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient, predictable, and repeatable development opportunities which, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates. Exploring in high-potential, proven, and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with growth opportunities. Anadarko exploration success has created value by expanding its future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to manage risk by monetizing discoveries. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Company performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investments in its businesses to manage through commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the flexibility of its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic growth opportunities. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Deepwater Horizon Settlement and Indemnity In October 2011, the Company and BP Exploration & Production Inc. (BP) entered into a settlement agreement, mutual releases, and agreement to indemnify, relating to the Deepwater Horizon events (Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company paid $4.0 billion and transferred its interest in the Macondo well and the Mississippi Canyon Block 252 lease (Lease) to BP, and BP accepted this consideration in full satisfaction of its claims against Anadarko for $6.1 billion of invoices issued through the settlement date as well as for potential reimbursements of subsequent costs incurred by BP related to the Deepwater Horizon events, including costs under the Operating Agreement (OA). In addition, BP fully indemnified Anadarko against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), claims for natural resource damages (NRD) and associated damage-assessment costs, and any claims arising under the OA. This indemnification is guaranteed by BP Corporation North America Inc. (BPCNA) and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-upon amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor. Under the Settlement Agreement, BP does not indemnify the Company against fines and penalties, punitive damages, shareholder, derivative, or security laws claims, or certain other claims. The Company believes that costs associated with any non-indemnified items, individually or in the aggregate, will not materially impact the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Refer to Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion and analysis of these events. Operating Highlights Significant 2011 operating highlights include the following: Overall Anadarko total-year sales volumes were 248 MMBOE, representing a 6% increase over 2010. Anadarko achieved liquids sales volumes of 106 MMBOE, representing a 10% increase over 2010. The Company achieved an approximate 80% success rate from offshore exploration and appraisal drilling completed in 2011. United States Onshore The Company Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies) achieved total-year sales volumes of 303 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), representing a 10% increase over 2010. The Company Southern and Appalachia Region achieved total-year sales volumes of 146 MBOE/d, representing a 17% increase over 2010, primarily due to increased drilling in the Eagleford and Marcellus shales. The Company entered into a joint-venture agreement that requires a third-party joint-venture partner to fund up to $1.6 billion of Anadarko future capital costs in exchange for a one-third interest in Anadarko Eagleford shale assets. The Company increased its ownership interest in a natural-gas processing plant (Wattenberg Plant), located in northeast Colorado, by acquiring an additional 93% interest for $576 million. The Company operates and owns a 100% interest in the Wattenberg Plant. Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, acquired a natural-gas processing plant and related gathering systems (Platte Valley), located in northeast Colorado, for $302 million. Anadarko has accumulated over 370,000 gross acres in the prospective liquids-rich area of the eastern Ohio Utica shale. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gulf of Mexico The Company Gulf of Mexico total-year sales volumes were 131 MBOE/d, representing a 15% decrease from 2010. Anadarko and its partners finalized a unitization agreement to develop the Lucius field, which was sanctioned in December 2011. Anadarko will operate the unit and has a 35% working interest in the field. The Company received drilling permits for one development well and two exploration appraisal wells, including the Cheyenne East well, Anadarko first deepwater discovery since the deepwater drilling moratorium. International The Company International total-year sales volumes were 85 MBOE/d, representing a 20% increase from 2010. The Company completed drilling five successful exploration wells; three in Ghana and two in Mozambique. The Company completed drilling seven successful appraisal wells; four in Ghana, two in Mozambique, and one in Brazil. Financial Highlights Significant 2011 financial highlights include the following: Anadarko net loss attributable to common stockholders for 2011, including the effect of the $4.0 billion payment made as a result of the Settlement Agreement, totaled $2.6 billion compared to net income of $761 million in 2010. The Company generated $2.5 billion of cash flows from operations, including the effect of the $4.0 billion payment required by the Settlement Agreement, compared to $5.2 billion in 2010 and ended the year with $2.7 billion of cash on hand. The Company entered into an agreement with a financial institution to provide up to $400 million of letters of credit (LOC Facility) which lowered the Company cost to issue letters of credit. The Company amended its $5.0 billion Facility to reduce maintenance costs and to lower interest rates under the facility by 125 basis points on borrowings and 30 basis points on undrawn amounts. Anadarko modified and extended swap maturity dates from October 2011 to June 2014 for certain of its interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal of $1.85 billion to better align the swap portfolio with the anticipated timing of future debt issuances. The Company impaired $1.2 billion of oil and gas reporting segment properties and $458 million of midstream reporting segment properties. The Company restructured 500,000 MMBtu/d of natural-gas three-way collar positions into fixed-price commodity swap positions for one million MMBtu/d with an average price of $4.69 per MMBtu. The Company received $419 million in contingent consideration related to its 2008 divestiture of its interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil. Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Drilling Update In July and August 2011, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, an agency of the Department of the Interior (DOI), issued drilling permits to Anadarko for the Heidelberg appraisal well, the Cheyenne East exploration well near the Independence Hub facility, and a development well in the Nansen field. Anadarko received a drilling permit for the Spartacus prospect in 2012 and is awaiting additional DOI approvals for other exploration plans and drilling permits. See Note 16 Contingencies Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the moratorium. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following discussion pertains to Anadarko results of operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition.

Production of natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand. Natural-Gas Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 United States Sales volumes Bcf 852 3 % 829 2 % 809 MMcf/d 2,334 3 2,272 2 2,217 Price per Mcf $ 3.87 (6 ) $ 4.12 14 $ 3.61 Natural-gas sales revenues (millions) $ 3,300 (4 ) $ 3,420 17 $ 2,924 Bcf billion cubic feet MMcf/d million cubic feet per day The Company natural-gas sales volumes increased 62 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to increased sales volumes in the Rockies of 84 MMcf/d, resulting from increased drilling in the Greater Natural Buttes area and the Wattenberg field, as well as increased sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region of 66 MMcf/d, primarily related to increased drilling in the Marcellus shale. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 86 MMcf/d, primarily due to 2010 price-related royalty relief, which did not apply for 2011, as well as natural production declines. The Company natural-gas sales volumes increased 55 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to increased sales volumes in the Rockies of 61 MMcf/d, resulting from increased drilling in Greater Natural Buttes and the Greater Green River basins, as well as increased sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region of 12 MMcf/d, associated with increased drilling in the Eagleford, Haynesville and Marcellus shales. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 18 MMcf/d due to natural production declines. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The average natural-gas price Anadarko received decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due the industry supply growing at a faster pace than demand in 2011. Anadarko average natural-gas price received increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in demand. Crude-Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 48 1 % 48 7 % 44 MBbls/d 132 1 130 7 120 Price per barrel $ 97.70 30 $ 74.96 28 $ 58.56 International Sales volumes MMBbls 31 20 % 26 7 % 24 MBbls/d 85 20 71 7 67 Price per barrel $ 109.20 39 $ 78.52 33 $ 59.01 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 79 8 % 74 7 % 68 MBbls/d 217 8 201 7 187 Total price per barrel $ 102.24 34 $ 76.22 30 $ 58.72 Oil and condensate sales revenues (millions) $ 8,072 44 $ 5,592 39 $ 4,022 MMBbls million barrels MBbls/d thousand barrels per day Anadarko crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 16 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase primarily resulted from an additional 15 MBbls/d in Ghana, where the Company first lifting occurred in the first quarter of 2011. Increased drilling in the Wattenberg field led to a 5 MBbls/d sales-volume improvement in the Rockies. Additionally, increased activity in the Eagleford shale and Bone Spring formation increased sales volumes from those areas by approximately 170%, contributing to an 8 MBbls/d sales-volume increase in the Southern and Appalachian Region. Partially offsetting these increases was a 9 MBbls/d sales-volume decline in the Gulf of Mexico principally caused by downtime for repairs at the Company Constitution spar and a third-party oil pipeline in 2011, as well as natural production declines. Anadarko crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 14 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was partially due to higher sales volumes of 5 MBbls/d in the Gulf of Mexico as repairs to third-party downstream infrastructure that was damaged in the 2008 hurricane season was completed during the third quarter of 2009. In addition, crude-oil sales volumes increased 4 MBbls/d in the Southern and Appalachia Region due to a shift in focus from drilling in dry-gas areas to drilling in liquids-rich areas and 3 MBbls/d in the Rockies due to realizing a full year of operations from an oil pipeline that was placed in service in mid-2009, as well as a shift in focus to liquids-rich areas. Also, Algerian crude-oil sales volumes increased 3 MBbls/d due to the timing of cargo liftings. The average crude-oil price Anadarko received increased for the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of increased global demand, as well as supply disruptions and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. The average crude-oil price realized by the Company was enhanced by the widening differential between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, as approximately 70% of Anadarko 2011 crude-oil sales volumes were based on prices that are either directly indexed to, or highly correlated to, Brent crude. Anadarko average crude-oil price increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to increased global demand. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 27 17 % 23 36 % 17 MBbls/d 74 17 63 36 47 Price per barrel $ 53.95 25 $ 43.07 37 $ 31.42 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 1,462 47 $ 997 86 $ 536 NGLs sales represent revenues from the sale of products derived from the processing of Anadarko natural-gas production. The Company NGLs sales volumes increased by 11 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the Company increased focus on liquids-rich areas, expanded horizontal drilling programs in the Wattenberg field, and increases related to the Wattenberg Plant acquisition. Anadarko NGLs sales volumes increased 16 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increased volumes primarily related to operations in the Rockies where an additional natural-gas processing train was brought online late in the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, improved recoveries in the Rockies resulted from new processing agreements entered into late in 2009. The average NGLs price increased for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, primarily due to higher crude-oil prices and sustained global petrochemical demand. Gathering, Processing, and Marketing Margin millions except percentages 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales $ 1,048 26 % $ 833 14 % $ 728 Gathering, processing, and marketing expenses 791 29 615 617 Margin $ 257 18 $ 218 96 $ 111 For the year ended December 31, 2011, the gathering, processing, and marketing margin increased $39 million. This increase was primarily due to increased natural-gas processing margins from higher NGLs prices and volumes, lower prices for natural-gas purchases, and favorable impacts attributable to 2011 asset acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the gathering, processing, and marketing margin increased $107 million. The increase was primarily due to higher margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory and increased NGLs volumes and prices. These increases were partially offset by the absence of gas-processing margins associated with assets divested in 2009. Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other, net Gains (losses) on divestitures in 2011 included losses on assets held for sale of $422 million as the Company began marketing certain onshore domestic properties from the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment and the midstream reporting segment in order to redirect its operating activities and capital investment to other areas. These assets were impaired to fair value. See Note 4 Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Also included is a loss of $76 million related to the effective termination of natural-gas processing contracts between the Company and the previous owner of the Wattenberg Plant that occurred in connection with the Company purchase of the plant. The loss represents the aggregate amount by which the Company contracts with the previous owner of the Wattenberg Plant were unfavorable as compared to current market transactions for the same or similar services at the date of the Company acquisition of the plant. These losses 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements were partially offset by a gain of $419 million related to the receipt and final settlement of contingent consideration related to the Company 2008 divestiture of its interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil. Gains on divestitures also include the recognition of a $21 million gain from the acquisition-date fair-value remeasurement of the Company pre-acquisition 7% equity interest in the Wattenberg Plant. Gains on divestitures in 2010 were $29 million and related primarily to the divestiture of onshore U.S. oil and gas properties. Gains on divestitures in 2009 were $44 million, primarily related to the sale of oil and gas properties in Qatar. Reversal of Accrual for DWRRA Dispute In January 2006, the DOI issued an order (2006 Order) to Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Corporation (KMOG), a subsidiary of Kerr-McGee Corporation (Kerr-McGee), to pay oil and gas royalties and accrued interest on KMOG deepwater Gulf of Mexico production associated with eight 1996, 1997, and 2000 leases, for which KMOG considered royalties to be suspended under the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA). KMOG successfully appealed the 2006 Order, and the DOI petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied on October 5, 2009. In 2009, based on the U.S. Supreme Court denial of the DOI petition for review by the court, Anadarko reversed its $657 million liability for accrued royalties on leases listed in the 2006 Order, similar orders to pay issued in 2008 and 2009, and other deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases with similar price-threshold provisions. In addition, the Company reversed its $78 million accrued liability for interest on these unpaid royalty amounts. Effective October 1, 2009, the Company ceased accruing liabilities for royalties and interest costs for deepwater Gulf of Mexico leases that have royalties suspended under the DWRRA. For more information on the DWRRA dispute, see Note 16 Contingencies Deepwater Royalty Relief Act in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Costs and Expenses millions except percentages 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 Oil and gas operating $ 993 20 % $ 830 (3 )% $ 859 Oil and gas transportation and other 891 9 816 23 664 Exploration 1,076 10 974 (12 ) 1,107 For the year ended December 31, 2011, oil and gas operating expenses increased by $163 million primarily due to (i) increased workovers and related freight costs of $47 million primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies, (ii) $36 million related to increased joint-venture activity primarily in the Rockies, Bone Spring and Marcellus shale in the Southern and Appalachia Region, and in Alaska, (iii) operating costs of $34 million resulting from the start of production in Ghana, and (iv) higher surface maintenance costs of $10 million primarily in the Rockies. For the year ended December 31, 2010, oil and gas operating expenses decreased primarily due to decreased workover costs of $28 million in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the moratorium and associated delays in obtaining drilling permits. For the year ended December 31, 2011, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased $75 million due to higher volumes, higher natural-gas processing fees that rise with increases in NGLs prices, and increased costs attributable to growth in U.S. onshore plays. These increases were partially offset by the 2010 expensing of amounts attributable to drilling rig lease payments made for rigs that sat idle during the moratorium, as well as rig termination fees incurred in 2010 related to deepwater drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2010, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased due to higher gas gathering and transportation costs of $77 million and $45 million, primarily attributable to increased production in the Rockies and the Southern and Appalachia Region, respectively, and the expensing of $27 million of drilling rig lease payments and $19 million of rig termination fees as discussed above. Partially offsetting this increase in oil and gas transportation and other expenses was $29 million of drilling rig contract termination fees incurred in 2009 as a result of low 2009 commodity prices. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploration expense increased $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, due to $143 million of higher geological and geophysical expense, primarily associated with increased seismic purchases in the Rockies, Gulf of Mexico, the Marcellus shale, Indonesia, Liberia, and East Africa. These additional expenses were partially offset by $48 million of lower dry hole expense, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration expense decreased $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to a $128 million decline in dry hole expense in the United States, and lower exit costs of $15 million in various international locations, partially offset by higher dry hole expense of $26 million in various other international locations, including Brazil, Ghana, and Mozambique. Exploration expense for 2010 included a $46 million increase related to the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico. millions except percentages 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2009 2009 General and administrative $ 1,060 10 % $ 967 (2 )% $ 983 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 3,830 3 3,714 5 3,532 Other taxes 1,492 40 1,068 43 746 Impairments 1,774 NM 216 88 115 Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 3,930 NM 15 NM NM not meaningful For the year ended December 31, 2011, general and administrative (G&A) expense increased by $93 million primarily due to higher employee-related costs of $67 million primarily from operational expansions and changes in pension discount rates; higher legal, consulting, and other expenses of $51 million related to ongoing litigation and other matters; and increased insurance costs of $9 million related to higher industry-specific rates as a result of the Deepwater Horizon events. These increased costs are partially offset by a gain of $46 million from the financial settlement stemming from Tronox rejection of the Master Separation Agreement (MSA) discussed in Note 16 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For the year ended December 31, 2010, G&A expense decreased due to lower bonus plan expense of $67 million, offset by higher legal and consulting fees of $41 million primarily due to costs associated with the Tronox bankruptcy, and higher employee-related costs. For the year ended December 31, 2011, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense increased by $116 million primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, partially offset by a lower average DD&A rate, largely the result of an $89 million DD&A expense that was taken in 2010 associated with depleted fields in the Gulf of Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2010, DD&A increased $182 million primarily due to higher sales volumes and $89 million associated with the Gulf of Mexico, as discussed above, partially offset by a lower average DD&A rate attributable to reserve increases in the Marcellus shale and the Eagleford shale. For the year ended December 31, 2011, other taxes increased by $424 million primarily due to higher crude-oil prices and total sales volumes, resulting in increased Algerian exceptional profits tax of $172 million, increased U.S. production and severance taxes of $152 million, and increased Chinese windfall profits tax of $55 million. Additionally, ad valorem taxes increased by $46 million in 2011 due to higher assessed property values. For the year ended December 31, 2010, other taxes increased $322 million primarily due to higher commodity prices and total sales volumes, resulting in increased Algerian exceptional profits tax of $129 million, increased U.S. production and severance taxes of $118 million, and increased Chinese windfall profits tax of $44 million. In addition, higher assessed property values increased ad valorem taxes by $30 million. Refer to Note 17 Other Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Algerian exceptional profits tax. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment expense of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, included $1.2 billion related to oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties located in the United States, $458 million for midstream reporting segment properties, and $91 million related to the Company investment in Venezuelan assets. Impairment expense of $952 million for U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and $446 million for associated midstream properties was triggered by lower natural-gas prices. Impairment expense also included $162 million related to reserves revisions for certain Gulf of Mexico properties, and $100 million related to onshore properties due to changes in projected cash flows, which resulted from the Company intent to divest the properties. All of these assets were impaired to fair value. Further declines in commodity prices could result in additional price-related impairments. See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the risks associated with oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices. Impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, included $145 million related to oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties located in the United States. The properties in the United States include $114 million related to a production platform included in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment that remains idle with no immediate plan for use, and for which a limited market exists. The platform was impaired to its estimated fair value of $25 million. Impairments for the year ended December 31, 2010, also included $61 million related to the Company investment in Venezuelan assets that was impaired to its estimated fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2011, Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs included a $4.0 billion expense for the Company cash payment made to BP pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, as well as $93 million of legal expenses and other related costs associated with the Deepwater Horizon events. These amounts were partially offset by a $163 million gain recognized in the fourth quarter for insurance recoveries associated with the Deepwater Horizon events. Legal expenses of $15 million related to the Deepwater Horizon events for 2010, previously recorded to general and administrative expense, were reclassified to Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs. Although Anadarko has been indemnified by BP for certain costs, the Company may be required to recognize a liability for amounts in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. In all circumstances, however, the Company expects that any additional indemnified liability that may be recognized by the Company will be subsequently recovered from BP itself or through the guarantees of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. Additionally, as part of the Settlement Agreement, BP has agreed that, to the extent it receives value in the future from claims that it has asserted or could assert against third parties arising from or relating to the Deepwater Horizon events, it will make cash payments (not to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate) to Anadarko, on a current and continuing basis, equal to 12.5% of the aggregate value received by BP in excess of $1.5 billion. Any payments received by the Company pursuant to this arrangement will be accounted for as a reimbursement of the $4.0 billion payment made to BP as part of the Settlement Agreement.

Additionally, 2011 interest expense was lower due to items that occurred in 2010 with no similar expense in 2011, including $86 million associated with losses on early debt retirements, $17 million of commitment and structuring costs associated with a contemplated term-loan facility, and $9 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs recognized with the retirement of the Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party. These items were partially offset by $48 million from a higher average outstanding debt balance and weighted-average interest rate on outstanding debt, $29 million related to interest on capital lease obligations incurred in 2011, $24 million attributable to increased amortization of debt-issuance and credit-facility origination costs, and $20 million of higher fees on issued letters of credit and credit-facility commitment fees. Anadarko interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to the reversal of $78 million in 2009 for previously accrued interest expense related to the DWRRA dispute. In addition, $86 million of losses on early retirements of debt, $17 million of commitment and structuring costs, and $9 million of expensed unamortized debt issuance costs, discussed above, were incurred in 2010. The Company also incurred $12 million of amortized debt issuance costs associated with the $5.0 billion Facility. These increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized interest of $59 million due to higher construction-in-progress balances related to long-term capital projects.

In 2008 and 2009, Anadarko entered into interest-rate swap contracts as a fixed-rate payor to mitigate interest-rate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. In 2009, the Company revised the swap contract terms to increase the weighted-average interest rate of the swap portfolio, and realized a $552 million gain. In 2011, the Company extended the swap maturity dates from October 2011 to June 2014 for interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $1.85 billion. In connection with these extensions, the swap interest rates were also adjusted. In addition, interest-rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $150 million were settled for a loss of $57 million in October 2011.

The Brazilian tax matter is currently being considered by the Brazilian courts, and the Company expects this litigation to be resolved within the next 18 to 24 months. An unfavorable decision may require the Company to record an additional tax liability in its consolidated financial statements. See Note 16 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Tronox litigation. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For 2010, total other income increased primarily due to the reversal of the $95 million reimbursement obligation to Tronox as a result of the cancellation of the MSA by Tronox that occurred as part of Tronox bankruptcy proceedings. Under the terms of the MSA entered into between Kerr-McGee and Tronox, a former subsidiary of Kerr-McGee that held Kerr-McGee chemical business, Kerr-McGee agreed to reimburse Tronox for 50% of certain qualifying environmental-remediation costs incurred and paid by Tronox and its subsidiaries before November 28, 2012, subject to certain limitations and conditions. The reimbursement obligation under the MSA was limited to a maximum aggregate reimbursement of $100 million. The reversal of this liability in 2010 was partially offset by $54 million of unfavorable changes in foreign-currency exchange rates primarily attributable to cash denominated in Brazilian currency held in escrow. Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (856 ) $ 820 $ (5 ) Effective tax rate 25 % 50 % 5 % The Company reported a loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011. As a result, items that ordinarily increase or decrease the tax rate will have the opposite effect. The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily attributable to the following: tax expense associated with the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax, which is non-deductible for Algerian income tax purposes; U.S. tax on foreign income inclusions and distributions; foreign tax rate differential and valuation allowances; and items resulting from business acquisitions and other items. These amounts were partially offset by the following: U.S. income tax benefits associated with foreign losses and the restructuring of foreign operations; and state income tax benefits. The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily attributable to the following: tax expense associated with the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax; U.S. tax on foreign income inclusions and distributions; foreign tax rate differential and valuation allowances; and the unfavorable resolution of uncertain tax positions. These amounts were partially offset by the following: U.S. income tax impact from losses and restructuring of foreign operations; and the federal manufacturing deduction and other items. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2009, was primarily attributable to the following: tax expense associated with the accrual of the Algerian exceptional profits tax; foreign tax rate differential and valuation allowances; and U.S. tax on foreign income inclusions and distributions. These amounts were partially offset by the following: benefits associated with changes in uncertain tax positions; state income taxes, including a change in the state income tax rate expected to be in effect at the time the Company deferred state income tax liability is expected to be settled or realized; and U.S. income tax impact from losses and restructuring of foreign operations and other items. For additional information on income tax rates, see Note 18 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $81 million, $60 million, and $32 million, respectively, primarily related to the public ownership interests in Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Public ownership of WES was 54.7%, 51.5%, and 43.2% at year-end 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 8 Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. OPERATING RESULTS Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the performance of Anadarko reporting segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A, impairments, Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs, and unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (Adjusted EBITDAX). The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes exploration expense, as it is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Anadarko definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs as these costs are outside the normal operations of the Company. See Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Finally, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, net are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives are not considered to be a measure of asset operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to stockholders. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Anadarko consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) before income taxes, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX by reporting segment.

The prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. (2) In 2010, the Company revised the definition of Adjusted EBITDAX to exclude the impact of unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, net. The prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to the higher crude-oil and NGLs prices and higher sales volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower natural-gas prices and increased operating expenses, primarily other taxes, which increased as a result of higher sales volumes and crude-oil prices. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to the impact of higher commodity prices and higher sales volumes, partially offset by the 2009 reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with the DWRRA dispute. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Midstream The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2011, resulted from increased margins due to higher NGLs prices and volumes, lower prices for natural-gas purchases, and margins provided by 2011 asset acquisitions. Also contributing to the increase was the recognition of a $21 million gain from the acquisition-date fair-value remeasurement of the Company pre-acquisition 7% equity interest in the Wattenberg Plant. These increases were partially offset by losses related to midstream assets held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in Adjusted EBITDAX resulted primarily from an increase in revenue due to higher prices and NGLs volumes, which impacted revenues earned under the Company percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts. These increases were reduced by higher cost of product related to NGLs purchases, which increased due to higher NGLs prices, and margins associated with assets divested in 2009. Marketing Marketing earnings primarily represent the margin earned on sales of natural gas, oil, and NGLs purchased from third parties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2011, resulted primarily from lower margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory and an increase in transportation expense related to new transportation agreements effective January 2011. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to higher margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory, and lower transportation costs due to lower firm transportation amortization as a result of asset impairments in 2009. Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consist primarily of corporate costs, realized gains and losses on derivatives, and income from hard minerals investments and royalties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to lower realized gains on commodity derivatives in 2011, realized losses on interest rate swaps in 2011, $250 million Tronox-related contingent loss in 2011, exchange-rate changes applicable to foreign currency, and the 2010 reversal of the remaining $95 million reimbursement obligation that was provided by Kerr-McGee to Tronox pursuant to the terms of the MSA. See Note 16 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily due to realized gains on interest-rate swaps in 2009, partially offset by increased realized gains on commodity derivatives in 2010 and the reversal of the $95 million liability related to the reimbursement obligation discussed above. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Reserves Anadarko is focused on growth and profitability, and reserves replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability partially depends on commodity prices and the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserves growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery, or acquisition of producing properties. Additional reserves information is contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 00000 00000 00000 MMBOE 2011 2010 2009 Proved Reserves Beginning of year 2,422 2,304 2,277 Reserves additions and revisions Discoveries and extensions 174 83 70 Infill-drilling additions (1) 203 312 125 Drilling-related reserves additions and revisions 377 395 195 Other non-price-related revisions (1) 7 (66 ) 87 Acquisition of proved reserves in place 1 32 Price-related revisions (1) 8 29 (39 ) Total reserves additions and revisions 392 359 275 Sales in place (29 ) (6 ) (24 ) Production (246 ) (235 ) (224 ) End of year 2,539 2,422 2,304 Proved Developed Reserves Beginning of year 1,673 1,624 1,600 End of year 1,811 1,673 1,624 (1) Combined and reported as revisions of prior estimates in the Company Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Proved Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2011, the Company added 392 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries, and extensions) and revisions. The Company expects the majority of future reserves growth to come from revisions associated with infill drilling (reserves bookings related to infill wells are treated as positive revisions), extensions of current fields, new discoveries onshore United States and in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, successful exploration in international growth areas, and purchases of properties in strategic areas. Additions During 2011, Anadarko added 174 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful domestic drilling in the Marcellus and Eagleford shale areas and the Gulf of Mexico. Although shale plays represent only about 5% of the Company total proved reserves, growth in the shale plays contributed 119 MMBOE of total additions. The Company had no material acquisitions of proved reserves in place in 2011. During 2010, Anadarko added 83 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the United States. Shale plays represented about 2% of the Company total proved reserves at year-end 2010, but contributed 45 MMBOE of additions. During 2009, Anadarko added 70 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling. The Company also acquired 32 MMBOE of proved reserves in place related to onshore domestic assets in 2009. 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revisions Total revisions in 2011 were 218 MMBOE or 9% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. The revisions included an increase of 203 MMBOE related to the continuation of successful infill drilling in large onshore areas, including the Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Pinedale fields, 182 MMBOE of positive revisions to prior estimates and 8 MMBOE associated with higher oil prices. These positive revisions were partially offset by the transfer of 175 MMBOE of proved reserves to unproved categories primarily as a result of changes to development plans and economic conditions experienced during 2011. Total revisions in 2010 were 275 MMBOE or 12% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. The revisions included an increase of 312 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling in large onshore areas, 77 MMBOE of revisions to prior estimates, and 29 MMBOE associated with higher oil and gas prices. These positive revisions were partially offset by the transfer of 143 MMBOE of PUDs to unproved categories as a result of changes to development plans during 2010. Total revisions in 2009 were 173 MMBOE or 8% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. The revisions included an increase of 125 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling in large onshore areas and 87 MMBOE of revisions to prior estimates. The 2009 revisions also included a decrease of 39 MMBOE caused by lower natural-gas prices. Sales in Place In 2011, the Company sold U.S. properties containing 7 MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 22 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. This included a sale of working interest in the Maverick basin as well as sales of assets in South Texas and Alaska. In 2010, the Company sold properties located in the United States and Egypt that held 5 MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 1 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. In 2009, the Company sold properties located primarily in the Rockies, which accounted for 14 MMBOE of developed properties and 10 MMBOE of undeveloped properties. Discounted Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2011, the discounted estimated future net cash flows (at 10%) from Anadarko proved reserves was $26.5 billion (measured in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This amount was calculated based on the 12-month average beginning-of-month prices for the year, held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The increase of $5.0 billion or 23% in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily due to an increase in liquids prices and positive revisions of previous reserves estimates. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and natural gas. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarko generates cash needed to fund capital expenditures, debt-service obligations, and dividend payments primarily from operating activities, and enters into debt and equity transactions to maintain the desired capital structure and finance acquisition opportunities. Liquidity may also be enhanced through asset divestitures and joint ventures that reduce future capital expenditures. Consistent with this approach, cash flows from operating activities were the primary source for capital investment funding during 2011. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. At December 31, 2011, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $2.5 billion at a rate of 1.79% under the $5.0 billion Facility. These borrowings were used to fund a portion of the Company $4.0 billion payment to BP pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Company plans to repay these borrowings with a portion of the proceeds from the monetization of certain assets, potentially including onshore domestic properties, Indonesian properties, and its Brazilian subsidiary. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements At December 31, 2011, Anadarko scheduled 2012 debt maturities were $170 million. In addition, the Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to the Company in October 2012, as discussed below. The Company has a variety of funding sources available to satisfy these obligations, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements, and remaining available capacity under the $5.0 billion Facility. Management believes that the Company liquidity position, asset portfolio, and continued strong operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund current operations. Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility bear interest, at the Company election, at (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.50%, based on the Company credit rating, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.50%. Obligations incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as obligations Anadarko has to lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments as discussed in Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, are guaranteed by certain of the Company wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the United States and 65% of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The Company had available borrowing capacity of $2.1 billion at year-end 2011 ($5.0 billion maximum capacity, less $2.5 billion of outstanding borrowings and $400 million of letter-of-credit capacity maintained pursuant to the terms of the LOC Facility discussed below). During 2011, the Company entered into the LOC Facility. Compensating balances deposited with the financial institution provide for reduced fees under the LOC Facility. These compensating balances may be withdrawn at any time, resulting in higher fees. Cash and cash equivalents includes $328 million of demand deposits serving as compensating balances for outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2011. The LOC Facility requires the Company to maintain a senior debt revolving credit facility with minimum commitments of at least $1.0 billion and the availability to issue letters of credit of at least $400 million. Financial Covenants The $5.0 billion Facility contains various customary covenants with which Anadarko must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, liens on assets, and asset sales. Anadarko is also required to maintain, at the end of each quarter, (i) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 (relative to Consolidated EBITDAX for the most recent period of four calendar quarters), (ii) a ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities of no less than 1.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a Collateral Coverage Ratio of no less than 1.75 to 1.0, in each case, as defined in the $5.0 billion Facility. The Collateral Coverage Ratio is the ratio of an annually redetermined value of pledged assets to outstanding loans under the $5.0 billion Facility. Additionally, to borrow from the $5.0 billion Facility, the Collateral Coverage Ratio must be no less than 1.75 to 1.0 after giving pro forma effect to the requested borrowing. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, and there were no restrictions on its ability to utilize the available capacity of the $5.0 billion Facility. The covenants contained in certain of the Company credit agreements provide for a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered in order to ensure covenant compliance. At December 31, 2011, Anadarko was in compliance with all financial covenants. Zero-Coupon Notes In a 2006 private offering, Anadarko received $500 million of loan proceeds upon issuing the Zero Coupons. The Zero Coupons mature in October 2036 and have an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of $2.4 billion, reflecting a yield to maturity of 5.24%. The holder has the right to cause the Company to repay the then-accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons in October of each year starting in 2012. The accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons was $640 million at December 31, 2011, and will be $682 million in October 2012. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company considers its cash-flow-generating capacity and access to additional liquidity sufficient to continue to satisfy the Company debt-service and other obligations, including the potential early repayment of the outstanding Zero Coupons. WES Funding Sources WES, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, primarily uses cash flows from operations to fund ongoing operations (including capital investments in the ordinary course of business), service its debt, and make distributions to its equity holders. As needed, WES supplements cash generated from its operating activities with proceeds from debt or equity issuances or borrowings under its five-year, $800 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in March 2016 (RCF). During 2011, WES entered into its RCF which amended and restated its $450 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.30% to 1.90%, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.30% to 0.90%. At December 31, 2011, WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in the RCF, had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF, and had the entire $800 million of RCF borrowing capacity available. See Financing Activities below. Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage, which was obtained subsequent to the Deepwater Horizon events, includes physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis; $750 million for an offshore blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, and pollution from an offshore blowout ($75 million for onshore); $275 million for aircraft liability; and $675 million for third-party liabilities (including sudden and accidental pollution). The Company total limit is approximately $1.425 billion (which is reduced proportionally to the Company participating interest in a venture except for the $750 million portion dealing with an offshore blowout, which does not reduce below a 50% participating interest subject to certain reporting requirements) for the negative environmental impacts of an offshore blowout. There is currently no coverage for loss of production income from any facilities or for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, or restoration and redrill to the extent these items result from the effects of a named windstorm. Anadarko property and casualty insurance policies renew in June of each year, with the next renewals scheduled for June 2012. At that time, the Company may not be able to secure similar coverage for the same costs, if at all. Future insurance coverage costs for the oil and gas industry could increase and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that the Company considers economically acceptable. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows for the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. Forward-looking information related to the Company liquidity and capital resources is discussed in Outlook that follows. Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarko cash flows from operating activities in 2011 was $2.5 billion compared to $5.2 billion in 2010 and $3.9 billion in 2009. Cash flows for 2011 decreased primarily due to the $4.0 billion payment to BP related to the Settlement Agreement. Also contributing to the decline were lower natural-gas prices, increased operating expenses primarily due to other taxes (which increased as a result of higher sales volumes and commodity prices), and the impact of changes in working capital items. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude-oil and NGLs prices and higher sales volumes. Cash flows for 2010 increased primarily due to higher commodity prices, higher sales volumes, and the impact of changes in working capital items. One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is fluctuation in commodity prices, which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales-volume changes also impact cash flow, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko long-term cash flows from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, sales volumes, costs required for continued operations, and debt service. Investing Activities During 2011, 2010, and 2009, Anadarko received proceeds of $555 million, $70 million, and $176 million before income taxes, respectively, related to several property divestiture transactions. Financing Activities During 2011, Anadarko borrowed $2.5 billion at a rate of 1.79% under the $5.0 billion Facility to fund a portion of the $4.0 billion payment to BP associated with the Settlement Agreement (see Deepwater Horizon Settlement Costs below). In 2011, WES, a consolidated subsidiary of Anadarko, borrowed $320 million under its RCF primarily to fund a third-party asset acquisition and $250 million under its RCF to repay the senior unsecured term loan (Term Loan) as discussed in Uses of Cash . Also, during 2011, WES issued approximately 10 million common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $328 million, which was used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes. In addition, during 2011, WES completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021, with net proceeds from the offering used to repay amounts then outstanding under its RCF. During 2010, the Company received net proceeds of $2.7 billion related to the issuance of $2.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes and used the net proceeds, combined with cash on hand, to redeem $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2011 and 2012 debt maturities. See Uses of Cash for further information about debt repayments. In connection with entering into the $5.0 billion Facility in 2010 the Company paid upfront underwriting, structuring, arrangement, and other costs totaling $172 million. During 2010, WES borrowed a total of $670 million under its Term Loan and RCF primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from Anadarko. WES also issued approximately 13 million common units in two 2010 public offerings, realizing net proceeds of $338 million, which were used to repay a portion of outstanding RCF borrowings. During 2009, Anadarko raised $2.0 billion in connection with the public offering of senior notes and an additional $1.3 billion in connection with the public offering of 30 million shares of common stock. Proceeds from the offerings were used to fund the retirement of outstanding Floating Rate Notes and for general corporate purposes. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Uses of Cash Anadarko invests significant capital to acquire, explore, and develop oil and natural-gas resources and midstream infrastructure, in addition to funding ongoing operating costs, including interest cost and taxes, making debt repayments, and paying dividends to its shareholders. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the Company capital expenditures by category. 00000 00000 00000 millions 2011 2010 2009 Property Acquisitions Exploration $ 647 $ 519 $ 279 Development 22 266 Exploration 1,469 1,278 1,229 Development 3,525 3,267 2,886 Total oil and gas costs incurred (1) 5,641 5,086 4,660 Less: Corporate acquisitions and non-cash property exchanges (17 ) (37 ) (284 ) Less: Asset retirement costs (148 ) (86 ) (63 ) Less: Geological and geophysical, exploration overhead, delay rentals expenses, and other expenses (450 ) (291 ) (312 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures 5,026 4,672 4,001 Gathering, processing, and marketing and other (2) 1,527 497 557 Total capital expenditures (1) $ 6,553 $ 5,169 $ 4,558 (1) Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges, and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment and dry hole costs on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash-basis presentation. (2) Includes WES capital expenditures of $439 million, $81 million, and $32 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Company capital spending increased 27% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Anadarko increased its ownership interest in the Wattenberg Plant to 100% by acquiring an additional 93% interest for $576 million in May 2011. Also, during the first quarter of 2011, WES acquired Platte Valley from a third party for $302 million. These acquisitions, along with future expansion plans, align Anadarko natural-gas processing capacity with the Company anticipated production growth in the Rockies. In addition, these acquisitions position the Company to improve field recoveries and realize operational cost efficiencies. The increase to capital expenditures was also due to increased development drilling costs of $258 million primarily related to onshore U.S. properties and higher exploration expenditures of $191 million primarily resulting from exploration drilling in Ghana. Anadarko capital spending increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in exploration lease acquisitions onshore and offshore United States, higher development drilling onshore, and increased expenditures related to construction in Algeria. In early 2009, the Company began focusing its capital investments toward areas of the Company portfolio that have a higher liquids component and infrastructure advantages that enable Anadarko to extract higher-value liquids and access premium markets. See Outlook below for information regarding sources of cash used to fund capital expenditures for 2012. Deepwater Horizon Settlement Costs In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into the Settlement Agreement related to the Deepwater Horizon events. The Company paid $4.0 billion and transferred its interest in the Macondo well and Lease to BP. Refer to Note 2 Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pension Contributions During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company made contributions of $301 million to its funded pension plans, $10 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $17 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The increase in contributions to the funded pension plans during 2011 resulted from lower discount rates compared to the prior measurement period, which increased the pension liability and the corresponding funding target. Debt Retirements and Repayments During 2011, WES repaid $619 million of borrowings under its RCF and a $250 million Term Loan primarily from proceeds from public debt and equity offerings, as discussed in Sources of Cash . In addition, the Company repaid $285 million principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes that matured in September 2011. In 2010, the Company used $1.6 billion to repay the Midstream Subsidiary Note and $1.5 billion, including $86 million for early-tender premiums, to redeem senior notes scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2012. The repayments were funded with proceeds from new borrowings, as well as cash on hand. Also in 2010, WES repaid $371 million outstanding under its RCF primarily from proceeds related to its public offerings discussed in Sources of Cash . In 2009, using a portion of proceeds from new debt issuances, the Company repaid an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion of debt, including $1.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of Floating-Rate Notes due in 2009. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity, and interest rates, see Note 12 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Dividends and Distributions to Noncontrolling WES Interest Owners In 2011, 2010, and 2009, Anadarko paid $181 million, $180 million, and $176 million, respectively, in dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming an independent public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors. Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $72 million, $42 million, and $26 million during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its initial public offering in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.44 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2011. Other During 2011, the Company and its partners in the Jubilee project in Ghana purchased the FPSO. The Company cash contribution was $108 million. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Outlook Anadarko believes that its cash on hand and expected level of operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational and capital programs for 2012, while continuing to meet its other obligations. The Company cash on hand is available for use. If capital expenditures exceed operating cash flows and cash on hand, additional funding would likely be supplemented as needed through borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility, which provides available borrowing capacity of $2.1 billion ($5.0 billion maximum capacity, less $2.5 billion of outstanding borrowings and $400 million of letter-of-credit capacity maintained pursuant to the terms of the LOC Facility). The Company currently does not consider European sovereign debt events to pose significant risk to the Company ability to access available borrowing capacity under the $5.0 billion Facility. The Company may also enter into joint-venture arrangements and asset divestitures to supplement cash flow. The Company is marketing certain onshore domestic properties, Indonesian properties, and its Brazilian subsidiary, in order to redirect its operating activities and capital investment to other areas and to repay borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. In order to increase the predictability of 2012 cash flows, Anadarko entered into strategic derivative positions, which cover a portion of its anticipated natural-gas and crude-oil sales volumes for 2012 and 2013. For details of derivative positions at December 31, 2011, see Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In 2012, the Company entered into fixed-price swaps consisting of 60 MBbls/d at an average price of $107.20. The Company also entered into three-way collars for 45 MBbls/d, consisting of a sold call at $126, a purchased put at $105, and a sold put at $85, and for 15 MBbls/d, consisting of a sold call at $115, a purchased put at $95, and a sold put at $75. After the Company entered into the Settlement Agreement with BP in October 2011, the various credit rating agencies each reviewed the credit ratings assigned to Anadarko. Moody Investors Services placed the Company senior unsecured credit rating under review for upgrade. Standard & Poor affirmed its rating and revised its outlook from negative to stable. Fitch Ratings made no change to its rating or outlook. Any changes to the Company credit ratings could affect the Company requirement to provide financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements and derivative agreements, as well as the Company cost of future borrowing and ability to access capital markets. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company entered into a joint-venture agreement that requires a third-party partner to fund approximately $1.6 billion of Anadarko future capital costs in the Eagleford shale, located in southwest Texas, in exchange for a one-third interest in Anadarko Eagleford shale assets. The funding began in the second quarter of 2011 and covered $500 million of the Company 2011 development costs. The funding covers 90% of Anadarko development costs in subsequent years up to a $650 million annual limit. Based on expected activity, the third-party funding is expected to be fully utilized in the second half of 2013. At December 31, 2011, the Company had received $500 million of the total $1.6 billion funding obligation. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company entered into a joint-venture agreement whereby a third-party partner agreed to fund up to $1.5 billion of Anadarko share of future acquisition, drilling, completion, equipment, and other capital expenditures to earn a 32.5% interest in Anadarko Marcellus shale assets, primarily located in north-central Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2011, the Company had received $1.0 billion of the total $1.5 billion funding obligation. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. The Company material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Obligations and Commitments for more information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of the Company obligations at December 31, 2011. 0000000 0000000 0000000 0000000 0000000 Obligations by Period millions 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 2017 and beyond Total Total debt Principal current borrowings $ 170 $ $ $ $ 170 Principal long-term borrowings (1) 775 4,250 11,757 16,782 Investee entities debt (2) 2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 877 1,722 1,569 8,118 12,286 Investee entities interest (2) 46 158 258 4,123 4,585 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 573 943 829 599 2,944 Production platforms 46 106 80 168 400 Other 77 104 52 45 278 Asset retirement obligations 32 526 90 1,120 1,768 Midstream and marketing activities 393 840 783 1,547 3,563 Oil and gas activities 1,172 916 550 551 3,189 Derivative liabilities (3) 421 826 2 1,249 Uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties (4) 18 21 10 49 Environmental liabilities 20 8 3 61 92 Total (5) $ 3,845 $ 6,945 $ 8,476 $ 30,942 $ 50,208 (1) Represents the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of $2.4 billion as coming due after 2016. While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the holder has the right to put the outstanding Zero Coupons to the Company each October beginning in 2012 at the then-accreted value. The Company could be required to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupons at $682 million in October 2012. (2) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilities other for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note 9 Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) Represents Anadarko gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (4) See Note 18 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (5) This table does not include the Company pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 21 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include approximately $2.7 billion related to six offshore drilling vessels and $217 million related to certain contracts for onshore U.S. drilling rigs. Anadarko continues to manage its access to rigs in order to execute its drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with successful exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, are capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties. See Note 16 Contingencies Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on drilling rigs. 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company had $678 million in commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. For additional information, see Note 15 Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Company AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various transportation, storage, and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs in certain areas. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development, and production activities that extend beyond 2011. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic, and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $3.2 billion, comprised of $2.7 billion related to the United States and $500 million related to international locations. Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. At December 31, 2011, the Company balance sheet included a $92 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which relate to companies acquired by Anadarko. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For additional information on contracts, obligations, and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 10 Derivative Instruments, Note 12 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 15 Commitments, and Note 16 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the United States, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to the value of properties and equipment; proved reserves; goodwill; intangible assets; asset retirement obligations; litigation reserves; environmental liabilities; pension assets, liabilities, and costs; income taxes; and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection and development of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities. Under this method, acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves. Exploration geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of unproved properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Company current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, the Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rockies), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense. A majority of the Company unproved property costs are associated with properties acquired in the Kerr-McGee and Western acquisitions in 2006 and to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Company continuing exploration and development programs. Another portion of the Company unproved property costs are associated with the Land Grant acreage, where the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage. A change in the Company expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the Company unproved property. Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, which includes, for example, analyzing whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway or proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed in that period. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc., i.e., at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made. Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for derivatives, long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, guarantees, pension plan assets, initial measurements of AROs, and financial instruments that require fair-value disclosure, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or a market-observable price for a similar asset or liability, the Company utilizes the cost, income, or market valuation approach depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based upon management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. The market approach is based on management best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, future net cash flows, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the assets and liabilities of the acquired business to be recorded at fair value. Deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between asset and liability fair value and the tax basis of acquired assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Goodwill At December 31, 2011, the Company had $5.6 billion of goodwill, including $335 million as a result of the Wattenberg Plant acquisition. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Wattenberg Plant acquisition. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at October 1, or more often as facts and circumstances warrant. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. For the Company other gathering and processing, WES gathering and processing, and transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected 2012 EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include sustained price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets, as well as difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events. Based on the most recent goodwill impairment tests, the Company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the related reporting unit. Therefore, no impairment was indicated. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability is incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consults with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in forming the Company conclusion. 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment of Long-Lived Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an asset carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company utilizes a variety of fair-value measurement techniques when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments, other than those that satisfy specific exceptions, are recorded at fair value. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or determined through industry-standard valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange-traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments. Option fair values are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options. Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded to current earnings. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has non-contributory U.S. defined-benefit pension plans, including both qualified and supplemental plans, and a foreign contributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Determination of the benefit obligations for the Company defined-benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves many assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan benefit obligations, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded pension plans), the rate of future increases in compensation levels of participating employees, and the future level of health care costs. The Company amortizes prior service costs and credits on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. Actuarial gains and losses that exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Discount rate Accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments. The Company discounts those cash payments using a discount rate that reflects the weighted average of market-observed yields for select high quality (AA-rated) fixed-income securities with cash flows that correspond to the expected amounts and timing of benefit payments. Discount-rate selection for measurements prior to December 31, 2011, was based on a similar cash-flow-matching analysis, although, instead of using a portfolio of select high quality fixed-income securities to determine the effective settlement rate for a given plan obligation, the Company relied primarily on a published yield curve derived from market-observed yields for a universe of high quality bonds. Both methods are acceptable and result in a discount-rate assumption that represents an estimate of the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. However, the Company believes a discount rate reflecting yields for high-quality fixed-income securities better corresponds to the Company expectations as to the amount and timing of its benefit payments. Assumed rates of compensation increases for active participants vary by age group. The weighted-average assumed rate (weighted by the plan-level benefit obligation) used to measure the Company December 31, 2011 pension benefit obligations was 4.50%, and the weighted-average discount-rate assumption for other postretirement benefit obligations, which are longer in duration, was 4.75%. Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2011 pension investment balances by asset class and expected long-term asset allocation. The expected return for each asset class reflects capital-market projections formulated using a forward-looking building-block approach, while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions. Equity returns generally reflect long-term expectations of real earnings growth, dividend yield, and inflation. Returns on fixed-income securities are generally developed based on expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields have on the rate of return. Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed income markets. Because the assumption reflects the Company expectation of average annualized return over a long time horizon, generally, it is not expected to be significantly revised from year to year, even though actual rates of investment return from year to year often experience significant volatility. To measure the net periodic pension cost for its funded pension plans, Anadarko assumed an average long-term rate of return of 7.0%. A variation in this assumption of 25 basis points would have changed the measure of 2011 net periodic pension cost by approximately $3 million pretax, with higher investment return assumption resulting in lower recognized expense. Rate of compensation increases The Company rate of compensation increases assumption is based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions, and general labor cost inflation within the oil and gas industry. The benefit obligations at December 31, 2011, reflect assumed rates of long-term compensation increases for active participants that vary by age group, with the resulting weighted-average rate (weighted by the plan-level benefit obligation) of 4.5%. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. A 9% annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2012, decreasing gradually to 5% in 2018 and beyond. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS In 2011, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) that permits an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Thus, determining a reporting unit fair value is not required unless, as a result of a qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. This ASU is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Adoption of this ASU will have no impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
