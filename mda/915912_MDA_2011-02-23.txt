ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements included in this report. In addition, our actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements as a result of the factors discussed under Forward-Looking Statements as well as the risk factors described in Item 1a, Risk Factors, of this report. Executive Overview Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the United States. We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments, because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investm ent strategy or when pricing is attractive. Barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are located in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our strategy is to be leaders in market research and capital allocation, delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best-performing submarkets of the United States. Our communities are predominately upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. We also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of off ering a broad range of products and services. Financial Highlights and Outlook For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income available to common stockholders was $175,331,000 compared to $155,647,000 for 2009, an increase of 12.6%. The increase was due primarily to the loss on the redemption of unsecured notes and impairment loss recognized in 2009, with no comparable activity in 2010. Apartment fundamentals improved throughout 2010, driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate, modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product. Full year 2010 Established Communities NOI decreased 2.8% from the prior year as a result of a decline in rental revenue from the prior year experienced in the first half of 2010, as well as increased operating expenses during 2010. The trends we experienced in 2009 with respect to revenue and NOI growth improved throughout 2010. We experienced growth in Established Communities rental revenue over the prior year period for the second half of 2010, and our Established Communities NOI increased 2.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 over the prior year period. We expect Earnings per share diluted ( EPS ) will increase to between $3.09 and $3.34 for 2011 from $2.07 in 2010, driven primarily by gains on disposition of real estate as well as continued improvements in revenue and NOI from our Established Communities in 2011. This positive outlook reflects our expectations for (i) accelerated job growth, (ii) the expected continued weakness in the for-sale housing market during 2011, (iii) continued growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent and (iv) constrained levels of new supply. Our current financial outlook for 2011 provides for growth in rental revenue of between 4.0% and 5.5% in our Established Community portfolio resulting in a projected NOI growth for our Established Communities of 6.0% to 7.5%. 40 During 2010, we successfully raised or sourced capital totaling approximately $790,000,000 through sales of common equity in the public markets, issuance of unsecured debt in public and private markets, and asset sales. We used the proceeds received to fund our development and redevelopment activities, to acquire an indirect interest in assets through Fund II, to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt, and to repay floating rate debt, while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. The funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of three communities and our former corporate office for a gross sales price of $198,600,000. We expect to see continued strong investor demand for quality multifamily assets in 2011, due in part to the continued liquidity in the capital markets and continued constrained supply resulting from the decline in development activity in all markets. We increased development activity during 2010 from the prior year in anticipation of the continued improvement in the economy and apartment fundamentals, and believe that our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2010, we completed the development of four communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $566,700,000, which represents a savings from the original budgeted capitalized cost of $25,000,000. We started the development of 11 communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $643,400,000. Dur ing 2011, we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the market for a recovery in apartment fundamentals that we expect in 2011 and 2012. We anticipate new development starts in 2011 with a total projected capitalized cost of $800,000,000 to $900,000,000. Consistent with this view, we also expect to continue with our current level of redevelopment activity for our wholly-owned communities in 2011, during which we expect to start redevelopment of six wholly-owned communities. During 2011, we expect to disburse between $600,000,000 and $800,000,000 related to the 14 communities under development at December 31, 2010, the new development starts, and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development. We believe that our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2011. We expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt and/or common and preferred equity) and secured debt, as well as from disposition proceeds, joint ventures or from retained cash. We increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through development and acquisitions. During 2011, we expect to be active in both acquisition and disposition activity for our wholly-owned portfolio. This activity pertains primarily to portfolio shaping and repositioning, and is currently expected to have a nominal impact on our net capital position. Portfolio reshaping may also be accomplished through 1031 asset exchanges and we are actively pursuing such exchanges that do not materially impact our liquidity or geographic mix. In addition to this activity and our growth through our core competency of developing wholly-owned assets from capital sources, we also expect to acquire interests in additional assets through our investment in Fund II. We established Fund I and Fund II to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance of the Funds exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) visibility into the transactions occurring in multi-family assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio. Fund I is a discretionary real estate investment fund with nine institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund I and has invested approximately $50,000,000 in Fund I, representing a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund I was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in March 2008. Subsidiaries of Fund I have 21 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $434,163,000 with varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from October 2011 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. 41 In the third quarter of 2010, a lender ran a competitive bid process to sell a $26,000,000 non-recourse mortgage note secured by a Fund I asset. We participated in the bidding and purchased the note on an arms length basis for $24,000,000. The note pays interest-only through the maturity date of October 2014 at a stated interest rate of 6.06%. Subsequent to acquisition, we modified certain terms of the mortgage note, including (i) conforming the original principal balance to our purchase price, (ii) modifying the interest payment terms to require remittance of interest based on available cash flow with any deficiency in the monthly payment amount accruing to the principal due on the note, and (iii) modifying certain terms to help eliminate any potential conflicts between us and Fund I, such as removing any prepayment penalty. At the da te of acquisition and at December 31, 2010, the fair value of the underlying collateral exceeded the note carrying balance. Fund II is a discretionary real estate investment fund with six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and we have total equity commitments of $125,000,000, representing a 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund II had invested $493,135,000 as of December 31, 2010. Fund II has a term that expires in August 2018, plus two one-year extension options. Fund II now serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investment interests in apartment communities until August 2011 or, if earlier, until 90% of the committed capital of Fund II is invested, subject to certain exceptions. Fund II will not include or involve our development activities. We receive, in addition to any returns on our invested equity, asset mana gement fees, property management fees and redevelopment fees. We will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met. During the year ended December 31, 2010 subsidiaries of Fund II acquired the following six operating communities: Avalon Rothbury, a garden-style community consisting of 203 apartment homes located in Gaithersburg, MD, was acquired for a purchase price of $31,250,000; Creekside Meadows, a garden-style community consisting of 628 apartment homes located in Tustin (Orange County), CA, was acquired for a purchase price of $98,500,000; Grove Park Apartments, a garden-style community consisting of 684 apartment homes located in Gaithersburg, MD, was acquired for a purchase price of $101,000,000; The Apartments at Briarwood, a garden-style community consisting of 348 apartment homes located in Owings Mills, MD, was acquired for a purchase price of $44,750,000; Canyonwoods, a garden-style community consisting of 140 apartment homes located in Lake Forest, CA, was acquired for a purchase price of $24,700,000; and Fox Run Apartments, a garden-style community consisting of 776 apartment homes, located in Plainsboro, NJ, was acquired for a purchase price of $86,500,000. In conjunction with the acquisition of the community, the subsidiary of Fund II assumed the existing $45,000,000 4.4% fixed rate mortgage loan, which matures in November 2014. Subsidiaries of Fund II have eight loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $286,899,000 with varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from November 2014 to June 2019. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. In January 2011, a subsidiary of Fund II acquired Waterstone Carlsbad, a garden-style community in Carlsbad, CA containing 448 apartment homes for a purchase price of $78,100,000. As of January 31, 2011, Fund II had uncalled capital commitments of $166,300,000, of which $51,970,000 was our portion. 42 Communities Overview As of December 31, 2010, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 186 apartment communities containing 54,579 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which 14 communities were under construction and nine communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 30 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including 18 owned by subsidiaries of Fund I and eight owned by subsidiaries of Fund II. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 26 wholly owned communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 7,313 apartment homes. Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, Development Communities, and Development Rights. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity.

Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased $245,386,000, or 61.2%, in 2009 from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in gains from the sale of communities. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group o f assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 to net income for each year, are as follows (dollars in thousands): 44 For the year ended 12-31-10 12-31-09 12-31-08 Net income $ 174,079 $ 154,274 $ 410,746 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 30,246 30,315 33,010 Investments and investment management expense 3,824 3,844 4,787 Expensed development and other pursuit costs 2,741 5,842 12,511 Interest expense, net 175,209 150,323 114,910 (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net -- 25,910 (1,839 ) General and administrative expense 26,846 28,748 42,781 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (762 ) (1,441 ) (4,566 ) Depreciation expense 232,571 209,260 183,266 Impairment loss - land holdings -- 21,152 57,899 Gain on sale of real estate assets (74,074 ) (68,717 ) (284,901 ) Income from discontinued operations (1,937 ) (13,437 ) (26,767 ) Net operating income $ 568,743 $ 546,073 $ 541,837 The NOI increases for both 2010 and 2009, as compared to the prior year period, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): Full Year Full Year 2010 2009 Established Communities $ (11,896 ) $ (21,909 ) Other Stabilized Communities 24,154 32,599 Development and Redevelopment Communities 10,412 (6,454 ) Total $ 22,670 $ 4,236 The NOI decrease in Established Communities in 2010 is due to the rental revenue declines as a result of the job losses experienced in 2008 and 2009, coupled with increases in community operating expenses. During 2010, we experienced sequential increases in rental rates, while maintaining occupancy of at least 94% in all regions. We anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will increase in 2011 such that overall Established Communities rental revenue will increase between 4.0% and 5.5%. The projected revenue increase is due to our expectation of a continued economic recovery, coupled with favorable apartment market fundamentals. Expense growth also impacts growth in NOI, and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth. We expect operating expenses to increase in 2011 over 2010 between 0.0% and 2.0%. As a result, we expect NOI for our Established Communities to increase between 6.0% and 7.5%. These projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in 2011, both nationally and in the markets where we operate, the individual demand/supply c haracteristics of each submarket in which we operate and assessment of each community potential performance for the upcoming year. There can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions and/or their impact on our operating results will be accurate, and actual results could differ materially. Please see "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements" and other discussions in this report on Form 10-K for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations. Rental and other income increased in both 2010 and 2009 as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed communities, offset somewhat by decreased rental income from our Established Communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 40,489 apartment homes for 2010 as compared to 38,233 homes for 2009 and 37,886 homes for 2008. The increase in 2010 over 2009 is due to homes available from newly developed communities, offset partially by communities sold during 2010. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,823 for 2010 as compared to $1,910 in 2009 and $1,921 in 2008. 45 Established Communities Rental revenue decreased $6,137,000, or 0.9%, for 2010 and $11,014,000, or 1.7%, for 2009. The decrease in 2010 from 2009 is due primarily to lower rental rates. For 2010, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased 1.3% to $1,836 compared to $1,861 in 2009. There was an increase in year-over-year average economic occupancy for 2010 of 0.4 % to 96.0% compared to 95.6% in 2009. The decrease in rental revenue in 2009 from the prior year is due to a combination of lower rental rates and decreased occupancy. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupan cy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in rental revenue for our Established Community Eastern regions, and decreases in Established Communities rental revenue in our three West Coast regions for 2010 as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below. The Metro New York/New Jersey region, which accounted for approximately 28% of Established Community rental revenue for 2010, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 0.2% for full-year 2010 as compared to full-year 2009. Average rental rates decreased 0.1% to $2,272, but economic occupancy increased 0.3% to 96.2% during 2010 as compared to 2009. During 2010, the improving economy and moderate job growth in both New York City and surrounding suburban markets supported the return to positive results in 2010 over the prior year. We expect apartment market conditions to continue to improve at a moderate pace in 2011, with the strength of the recovery dependent largely on job and income growth in the region's large financial services industry. The New England region accounted for approximately 22% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 0.8% over the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 0.1% to $1,930 and economic occupancy increased 0.9% to 96.2% for 2010, as compared to 2009. Reduced competition from a weak housing market and a lower volume of new multifamily supply has contributed to the improvement in apartment market conditions. Job growth in the Boston area has been broad-based but with southwest Connecticut lagging given greater dependence on the financial service and manufacturing sectors. The Mid-Atlantic/Midwest region, which represented approximately 19% of Established Community rental revenue during 2010, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 1.0% as compared to 2009. Average rental rates increased by 1.5% to $1,753, while economic occupancy decreased by 0.5% from 96.5% to 96.0% for 2010 as compared to 2009. This region continues to benefit from the impact of government and government services employment, which has served to stabilize the economy relative to other regions. Northern California accounted for approximately 18% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 3.8% from the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 4.1% to $1,724, offset partially by an increase in economic occupancy of 0.3% to 96.1% for 2010 as compared to 2009. The region's large high-tech sector is generating positive job growth, while job growth in financial services and construction remains weak. The recovery in apartment market conditions in Northern California and other West Coast regions is lagging the recovery experienced to date in East Coast regions. We expect fundamentals will improve in 2011, driven by an improving economy. Southern California accounted for approximately 9% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 3.6% from the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 4.8% to $1,487, offset by an increase in economic occupancy of 1.2% to 95.3% for 2010 as compared to 2009. Apartment market conditions remain weak given a slow economic recovery in the region, however we expect conditions to improve in 2011, particularly in Orange County, as job growth resumes in line with a strengthening U.S. economy. The Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 4% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2010 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 6.5% from the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 7.2% to $1,190, offset partially by an increase in economic occupancy of 0.7% to 94.9% for 2010 as compared to 2009. Job growth in the region is broad-based, driven by improvement in both aerospace and high-tech. However, apartment fundamentals in the region remain challenging, due to a large amount of new rental supply in several submarkets. 46 Management, development and other fees increased $26,000, or 0.4%, in 2010 and increased $760,000, or 11.6%, in 2009. The increase in 2009 was due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from Fund II. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $12,006,000, or 5.6% in 2010 and increased $22,864,000, or 12.0%, for 2009 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes. In addition, 2009 increased over the prior year due to increased bad debt expense resulting from the recession. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $2,282,000, or 1.4% to $160,342,000 for 2010 and $7,746,000, or 5.2% to $158,060,000 for 2009. The increase in 2010 over 2009 is due primarily to increased community maintenance related costs, impacted by the severe weather in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, offset partially by a decrease in administrative and insurance related expenses. The decreases in administrative expense are primarily due to decreased bad debt. The increase in 2009 over 2008 was due primarily to increased administrative and community maintenance related costs, offset partially by a decrease in insurance and utility related expenses. The increases in administrative expense were primarily due to inc reased bad debt. Property taxes increased $9,686,000, or 11.6% and $9,863,000, or 13.4% in 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments. Property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals. For Established Communities, property taxes increased by $3,455,000, or 5.2% and $3,531,000, or 5.6% for 2010 and 2009, respectively over the prior year, due to both higher assessments throughout all regions, as well as the size and timing of successful appeals. The impact of the challenging economic environment experienced during 2008 and 2009 is only partially reflected in current assessments, as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments. However, tax rates have continued to increase despite downward adjustments in assessed values. We expect property taxes in 2011 to continue to increase over 2010 due primarily to higher tax rates. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change i n the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). We evaluate property tax increases internally, and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased by $272,000, or 0.7% in 2010 and decreased $2,315,000, or 5.8% in 2009 over the prior years. The decrease in 2009 from 2008 is due primarily to decreases in compensation costs, coupled with a reduction in costs associated with the initial start up of our Customer Care Center. The Customer Care Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia opened in 2007 and expanded in 2008 to centralize certain community-related accounting, administrative and customer service functions. Investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions and investment management. Investments and investment management costs decreased in 2010 by $20,000 or 0.5% from the prior year. Investments and investment management costs decreased in 2009 by $943,000 or 19.7% from 2008 due primarily to lower compensation and travel-related costs. Expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. Expensed development and other pursuit costs decreased in 2010 and 2009 from the prior years due to decreases in abandoned development pursuits attributable to continued economic improvement. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. 47 Interest expense, net increased $24,886,000, or 16.6% and $35,413,000, or 30.8% in 2010 and 2009, respectively over the prior years. This category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized and interest income. The increases in 2010 and 2009 are due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized in each of the respective years as compared to the prior year, coupled with increased interest expense in 2010 and 2009 compared to the prior years from additional secured and unsecured debt issued. The decrease in interest capitalized is due to the reduction in development activity in 2010 and 2009 as compared to the prior years. (Gain) loss on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects the impact of our debt repurchase activity for payments above or below the carrying basis. The net loss in 2009 is due to the $310,100,000 in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium, offset by the gain recognized from our January 2009 tender offer. We did not recognize any gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt in 2010. Depreciation expens e increased in 2010 and 2009 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities, offset by assets sold during the years. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) decreased $1,902,000, or 6.6% in 2010 and decreased $14,033,000, or 32.8% in 2009 as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2010 and 2009 as compared to the prior year is due primarily to decreases in compensation related expenses. The decrease in 2009 from the prior year is due primarily to higher severance and related costs in 2008 associated with the decrease in our planned development activity, higher federal excise tax expense in 2008 resulting from gains on disposition activity and organization costs for the formation of Fund II incurred in 2008. Impairment loss for 2009 and 2008 was due to the write down of eleven land parcels which we concluded that we did not plan to develop at the time of impairment. We did not recognize an impairment loss in 2010. Gain on sale of land decreased in 2010 and increased in 2009 as compared to the prior years due to the sale of two land parcels in 2009, without comparable activity in 2010 or 2008. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased $679,000 or 47.1% in 2010 and $3,125,000 or 68.4% in 2009 from the prior years. The decrease in 2010 is due to acquisition costs from Fund II which were not significant in 2009 or present in 2008. The decrease in 2009 is due primarily to the recognition of our proportionate amount of an impairment loss that one of our unconsolidated investments recognized on one of its operating communities in 2009. In addition, gains from both the sale of a community by an unconsolidated joint venture as well as from an investment in a joint venture formed to develop for sale homes occurred in 2008 that were not present in 2009. These amounts were partially offset by the recognition of our promoted interest in the joint venture that owns Avalon Chrystie Place in 2009. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010. This income decreased for 2010 and 2009 due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period. See Note 7, Real Estate Disposition Activities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on sale of communities increased in 2010 and decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior years as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year. The amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2010 resulted in income to us for the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of $1,252,000 compared to income of $1,373,000 in 2009 and income of $741,000 in 2008. The increase in income in 2009 relative to 2010 and 2008 is due primarily to reimbursement to us in 2009 for our joint venture partners portion of expenses incurred by Fund II. The conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2008 and 2009 also contributed to the increase in 2009 over 2008, thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests. 48 FFO FFO is considered by management and the industry to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Sele cted Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically prior to maturity; normal recurring operating expenses; DownREIT partnership unit distributions; and capital calls for Fund II, as required. Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended December 31, 2010, raising approximately $589,000,000 in the form of public equity and unsecured debt. In 2011, we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including cash balances on hand, and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below, as well as our operating activities. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. At December 31, 2010, we have unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow of $479,769,000 available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities, of which $93,440,000 relates to a Development Right for which we have not begun construction. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $306,426,000 at December 31, 2010, an increase of $200,735,000 from $105,691,000 at December 31, 2009. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $332,106,000 in 2010 from $378,600,000 in 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by the timing of general corporate expenditures in 2010 as compared to 2009. 49 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $298,936,000 in 2010 related to investments in assets through development and redevelopment. In total, we invested $447,045,000 during 2010 in the following areas: We invested approximately $429,853,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities. We had capital expenditures of $17,192,000 for real estate and non-real estate assets. These amounts are partially offset by the proceeds from the disposition of real estate of $194,009,000. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $167,565,000 in 2010. The net cash provided is due primarily to the issuance of common shares, primarily through the two continuous equity programs that we initiated in August 2009 and November 2010, for aggregate net proceeds of $381,365,000, and issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of $250,000,000, offset by the payment of cash dividends in the amount of $298,090,000 and repayment of unsecured notes at maturity of $89,576,000, and the repayment of secured notes of $69,327,000. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We currently have a $1,000,000,000 revolving variable rate Credit Facility with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in November 2011. We pay an annual facility fee of approximately $1,250,000. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.40% per annum (0.66% on January 31, 2011). The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.325% to LIBOR plus 1.00% based on our credit rating. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $650,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pr icing provided by the Credit Facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. At January 31, 2011, there were no amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility, $52,923,000 was used to provide letters of credit, and $947,077,000 was available for borrowing under the Credit Facility. We expect to refinance the Credit Facility prior to maturity in November 2011. The market for bank credit has changed materially since our existing facility was established in 2006. We expect the cost of the new facility will increase as compared to our current Credit Facility. While market conditions likely support an ability to retain our current capacity, a reduction in capacity may be appropriate to avoid increased costs to maintain that capacity. We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The financial covenants include the following: limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; limitation on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and minimum levels of debt service coverage. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2010. In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. We believe that these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured. Continuous Equity Offering Programs In August 2009, we commenced our first continuous equity program ( CEP I ), under which we were authorized to sell up to $400,000,000 of our common stock until August 2012. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we completed the sale of common stock authorized under CEP I. During 2010 we sold 3,080,204 shares for an average sales price of $95.88 and net proceeds of $290,884,000. From inception of CEP I in August 2009 through completion of the offering in the third quarter of 2010, we sold a total of 4,585,105 shares at an average sales price of $87.24 for net proceeds of $393,993,000. 50 In November 2010, we commenced our second continuous equity program ( CEP II ), under which we may sell up to $500,000,000 of our common stock from time to time during a 36-month period. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP II, we engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. During the three months ended December 31, 2010 we sold 432,832 shares under CEP II at an average sales price of $112.44 per share, for net proceeds of $47,935,000. In January 2011, we issued an additional 177,837 shares at an average price of $111.15 per share, for net proceeds of $19, 470,000. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in 2008 and 2009. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our Credit Facility or by equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently antici pated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. In addition to the proceeds received under CEP I and CEP II discussed above, the following financing activity occurred during 2010. In February 2010, we repaid a 6.47% fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $13,961,000 in advance of its March 2012 scheduled maturity date. In March 2010, we repaid a 6.95% fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $11,226,000 in advance of its February 2025 scheduled maturity date. In October 2010, we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $28,989,000 in accordance with its scheduled maturity date. Also in October 2010, we repaid a 5.17% fixed rate secured mortgage note in the amount of $9,780,000 in advance of its July 2024 scheduled maturity date In November 2010, we issued $250,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement. The notes had an all-in interest rate of 4.04%, maturing in January 2021. In December 2010, we repaid $89,576,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in accordance with their scheduled maturity. After considering applicable hedging instruments, the notes had an all-in interest rate of 7.31%. The following table details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands). 51 All-In Principal interest maturity Balance outstanding Scheduled maturities Community rate (1) date 12-31-09 12-31-10 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter

(2) Variable rate, tax-exempt debt for which the interest rate on a portion of this debt was effectively fixed through an interest rate swap agreement through the maturity of the swap in early June 2010. Concurrent with the maturity of the interest rate swap, we executed an interest rate cap limiting the maximum interest rate paid on the portion of the debt hedged. The entire outstanding balance has therefore been presented as variable rate financing beginning June 30, 2010. 52 (3) Variable rates are given as of December 31, 2010. (4) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (5) Represents full amount of the debt as of December 31, 2010. Actual amounts drawn on the debt as of December 31, 2010 are $47,074 for Bowery Place II, $90,000 for Morningside Park, $104,781 for Walnut Creek, and $0 for West Chelsea. (6) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and are not net of $760 and $2,448 of debt discount and basis adjustments associated with the hedged unsecured notes as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, as reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. (7) In October 2009, we executed interest rate swaps allowing us to effectively convert principal of our fixed rate unsecured notes to floating rate debt. (8) In October 2010, we elected to fix the borrowing rate until June 2011, at which point we will select the updated term and mode for the bonds. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2010, we had 14 new wholly-owned communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $466,991,000 remained to be invested. We also had nine wholly owned communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $73,518,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we may be required to contribute our proportionate share of capital to Fund II, if or to the extent that Fund II makes capital calls in conjunction with additional community acquisitions during 2011. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, as well as for equity contributions to Fund II, will be funded from: cash currently on hand, including cash in construction escrows, invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles; the remaining capacity under our existing $1,000,000,000 Credit Facility; retained operating cash; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding, including joint venture activity. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the Funds, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. 53 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, Investments in Real Estate Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. CVP I, LLC has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturing in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We have agreed to guarantee, under limited circumstances, the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of CVP I, LLC repayment obligations under the bonds . We have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that CVP I, LLC will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project (Chrystie Place in New York City), which is expected in 2011. Our 80% partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations. The estimated fair value of and our obligation under these guarantees, both at inception and as of December 31, 2010, were not significant. ; As a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at December 31, 2010. Subsidiaries of Fund I have 21 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $434,163,000, including $24,060,000 for the mortgage note we purchased during 2010 as discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Fund I subsidiary loans have varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid), ranging from October 2011 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund I with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund I, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund I be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund I, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund I, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund I (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $7,500,000 as of December 31, 2010). As of December 31, 2010, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund I is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund I liquidation scenario. The es timated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2010 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2010. Subsidiaries of Fund II have eight loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $286,899,000 with maturity dates that vary from November 2014 to June 2019. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund II with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed, beyond our proportionate share of capital commitments supporting the debt of Fund II, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund II be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $5,842,500 as of December 31, 2010). As of December 31, 2010, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund II is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund II liquidation scenario. 160; The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2010 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2010. 54 Each individual mortgage loan of Fund I or Fund II was made to a special purpose, single asset subsidiary of the Funds. Each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only, except under exceptional circumstances (such as fraud or misapplication of funds) in which case the respective Fund could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan. In no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in the Funds, including against us or our wholly owned subsidiaries that invest in the Funds. A default by a Fund or a Fund subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other non-Fund subsidiaries or affiliates. If a Fund subsidiary or a Fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, the value of our investment in that Fund would likely d ecline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to one of the Fund partners in each Fund as described above. If a Fund subsidiary or a Fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we and/or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support the Fund through additional equity contributions and/or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default (such as foreclosure of a Fund asset). However, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide such voluntary support, or take such other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the Fund and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve. MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $105,000,000. The loan is a fixed rate, interest-only note bearing interest at 6.02%, maturing in December 2015. We have not guaranteed the debt of MVP I, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should MVP I, LLC be unable to do so. Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $45,068,000 maturing in April 2016. The variable rate loan had an interest rate of 3.60% at December 31, 2010. We have not guaranteed the debt of Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC be unable to do so. Aria at Hathorne Hill, LLC is a joint venture in which we have a non-managing member interest. The LLC is developing for-sale town homes in Danvers, Massachusetts. The LLC has a variable rate loan for $1,860,000 at an interest rate of 4.19% that matured in June 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the amounts under this borrowing have not been repaid, and the venture is negotiating an extension or refinancing of the amounts outstanding. The lender has not to date declared an event of default with respect to the note or required the venture to pay a default rate of interest. Although we bear no responsibility to repay the amounts outstanding, we have the right to cure any event of default by the venture. In 2007 we entered into a non-cancelable commitment (the Commitment ) to acquire parcels of land in Brooklyn, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111,000,000 subject to escalations based on the timing of the acquisitions. Under the terms of the Commitment, we are closing on the various parcels over a period determined by the seller ability to execute unrelated purchase transactions and achieve deferral of gains for the land sold under this Commitment. However, under no circumstances will the Commitment extend beyond 2011, at which time either we or the seller can compel execution of the remaining transactions. At December 31, 2010, we have an outstanding commitment to purchase the remaining land for approximately $49,979,000. There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. Contractual Obligations There have not been any material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2010. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): 55 Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt Obligations $ 4,068,417 $ 237,337 $ 882,777 $ 578,792 $ 2,369,511 Operating Lease Obligations (1)(2) 3,342,326 23,747 53,361 54,119 3,211,099 Total $ 7,410,743 $ 261,084 $ 936,138 $ 632,911 $ 5,580,610 (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and April 2095. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. (2) Includes cash payments under a land lease related to a development pursuit of $5,400 in 2011 and between $8,000 and $12,000 per year through the expiration date of the lease in 2105, which at January 31, 2011, were being offset in their entirety by cash receipts from subleases. In February 2011 we exercised a termination provision under this land lease, eliminating all of our future obligations under the land lease, reducing both our future cash payments due under the land lease and offsetting cash receipts under the associated subleases. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including the recent economic downturn; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. 56 We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future res ults, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition to the factors referred to below, you should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., Risk Factors, in this document for a discussion of additional risks associated with our business and these forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of Fund I, Fund II or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective Fund; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. 57 We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2010, our assets would have increased by $1,360,241,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $990,766,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we beli eve cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2010 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our operating expenses would have increased by $2,148,000. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have decreased by $7,725,000. 58 Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable. Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and the availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development by us no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. We expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits, which includes the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits, in the amounts of $2,741,000 in 2 010 and $5,842,000 in 2009. These costs are included in operating expenses, excluding property taxes on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. We did not recognize any charges for impairment during 2010. During 2009 and 2008, we concluded that the economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning. This resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of $21,152,000 and $57,899,000 respectively related to the impairment of 11 land parcels which we concluded we no longer intended to develop at that time. We used both internal models and third party pricing estimates to determine the fair values of the land parcels considered to be impaired. For assets zoned for multifamily residential use, we used an internal model and used third-party pricing for all other assets. Both approaches incorporated significant other unobservable i nputs and are therefore considered to be Level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy. Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1a., Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular cor porate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2010, our net income would have decreased by approximately $70,100,000. Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.
