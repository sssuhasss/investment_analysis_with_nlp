Overview Newmont is one of the world largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and the Fortune 500, and has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World for five consecutive years. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and gold/copper properties. We have significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Mexico and New Zealand. 48 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Our vision is to be the most valued and respected mining company through industry leading performance. In 2011, we successfully executed on the key benchmarks that we set out at the beginning of the year. Delivering strong operating performance. Record Cash flow from continuing operations of $3,591, an increase of 13% over 2010; Gold operating margin (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 83) of $971 per ounce in 2011, an increase of 32% over 2010 compared to an increase of 28% in the average realized gold price for the same period; Record Sales of $10,358, an increase of 9% over 2010; Consolidated gold production of approximately 5.9 million ounces (5.2 million ounces attributable to Newmont) at Costs applicable to sales of $591 per ounce; Consolidated copper production of approximately 352 million pounds (206 million pounds attributable to Newmont) at Costs applicable to sales of $1.26 per pound; Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders of $0.74 per share, Adjusted net income (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 83) of $4.39 per share; and Net increase of 5.3 million ounces of gold reserves, after depletion, to a record 98.8 million ounces at December 31, 2011. Advancing our project pipeline. Our current plans reflect the intended development of assets within our global development portfolio to increase annual attributable gold production to approximately 7 million ounces by 2017. This production target represents a potential increase of approximately 35% in anticipated 2017 annual production from the Company 2011 attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces. We also manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects, including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities. Our development opportunities that have advanced to full funding approval during 2011, and comprise a significant part of the Company growth strategy, include Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami Shaft in Australia, as described further below. Akyem, Ghana . Since full funding approval by the Board of Directors (the Board ) in March 2011, the project has continued to advance with award of the main civil and mechanical construction contracts, commencement of bulk earthworks, major civil work and underground utilities. First structural concrete was placed in August 2011 and the establishment of the first set of households at the resettlement villages took place in October 2011. First production is expected in late 2013 to early 2014 with approximately three to six months expected for ramp-up to commercial production. Gold production is expected to be approximately 350,000 to 450,000 ounces per year at Costs applicable to sales of $450 to $550 per ounce for the first five years of the mine operating life of approximately 16 years (based on current gold reserves). Capital costs are estimated at $850 to $1,100, of which approximately $450 have been incurred at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, we reported 7.4 million ounces of gold reserves at Akyem. Conga, Peru . Following the full funding approval by the Board in July 2011, the project progressed infrastructure works, earthworks construction, drilling, detailed engineering and procurement of equipment and materials. Construction activities on the Conga project were suspended on November 30, 2011, at the request of Peru central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central 49 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved by the central government in October 2010, will be reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. Construction will remain suspended for the duration of the review; however, progress continues on engineering and procurement work. Should we be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga, we may reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia. If the project proceeds, gold production is expected to be approximately 300,000 to 350,000 attributable ounces per year during the first five years of production at average Costs applicable to sales of $400 to $450 per ounce. Copper production is expected to be approximately 80 to 120 million pounds per year during the first five years of production at average Costs applicable to sales of $1.25 to $1.75 per pound. The project has an anticipated mine life of approximately 19 years, with additional district exploration potential. Capital costs are estimated at $4,000 to $4,800 ($2,000 to $2,400 attributable to Newmont) of which approximately $1,000 have been incurred at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011 we reported 6.5 million attributable ounces of gold reserves and 1,690 million attributable pounds of copper reserves at Conga. See Risk Factor Our operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga Project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks, which have resulted most recently in the suspension of construction activities in our Conga project for a description of political risks related to the project development. Tanami Shaft, Australia . Following the full funding approval by the Board in July 2011, development efforts have progressed. The project will support underground expansion at the Callie and Auron ore bodies, reduce cut-off grade, enhance productivity and facilitate possible additional mine expansion. The project is expected to add gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces per year during the first five years of production while lowering Costs applicable to sales for the first five years by approximately $100 per ounce. First production is expected in 2015. Capital costs are expected to be approximately $400 to $450, of which approximately $30 have been incurred at December 31, 2011. In addition to these projects receiving full funding decisions in 2011, as described above, we advanced approximately 20 earlier stage development assets through our project pipeline in our four operating regions. The exploration, construction and operation of these earlier stage development assets will require significant funding when they go into execution. Two of these projects are described further below: Merian, Suriname . Feasibility study work for the Merian project began in the third quarter of 2011 and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. The Company has also recently commenced negotiations for a mineral agreement with the government of Suriname. The development of the Merian project allows Newmont to pursue a new district with upside potential and the opportunity to grow and extend the operating life of the South American region. First production is targeted for 2015 with initial estimated attributable gold production of approximately 300,000 ounces per year. Long Canyon, Nevada . Since completing the acquisition of Fronteer Gold Inc. ( Fronteer ) in April 2011, the project entered into the pre-feasibility stage as we further develop our understanding of what we expect could be another Carlin-type trend at Long Canyon. We have received an expanded exploration area permit allowing access to project targets. We continue to make progress on the drilling program. A total of 72 kilometers of drilling was completed in 2011 and we anticipate an additional 65 kilometers to be drilled in 2012. Our intention is to bring the project into production in 2017 with initial estimated gold production of approximately 200,000 to 300,000 ounces per year. Hope Bay, Canada. On January 31, 2012, we announced that our Hope Bay project was placed on care and maintenance following our evaluation of development options and economic feasibility for the project compared with other project and development opportunities within our wider project pipeline. The Hope Bay project is not included as part of our 2017 strategic growth plan or capital 50 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION expenditure outlook for 2012. At December 31, 2011, we recorded an impairment of $2,097 related to Hope Bay. Gold Price-Linked Dividend In April 2011, the Company introduced the first gold price-linked dividend policy, followed by the announcement of an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy in September 2011, under which the Company annual dividend has the potential to increase to $4.70 per share if the Company average realized gold price exceeds $2,500 per ounce. Under the policy, unless otherwise determined by the Board, the dividend will be calculated based upon our average realized gold price during the preceding quarter in the manner highlighted in the table below: Average Realized Gold Price Quarterly Dividend Annualized Dividend $1,100 - $1,199 $0.100 $0.40 $1,200 - $1,299 $0.150 $0.60 $1,300 - $1,399 $0.200 $0.80 $1,400 - $1,499 $0.250 $1.00 $1,500 - $1,599 $0.300 $1.20 $1,600 - $1,699 $0.350 $1.40 $1,700 - $1,799 $0.425 $1.70 $1,800 - $1,899 $0.500 $2.00 $1,900 - $1,999 $0.575 $2.30 $2,000 - $2,099 $0.675 $2.70 $2,100 - $2,199 $0.775 $3.10 $2,200 - $2,299 $0.875 $3.50 $2,300 - $2,399 $0.975 $3.90 $2,400 - $2,499 $1.075 $4.30 $2,500 - $2,599 $1.175 $4.70 The fourth quarter 2011 dividend under this policy of $0.35 per share (based on our third quarter 2011 average realized gold price of $1,695 per ounce) represents an increase of 17% over the $0.30 dividend paid in the third quarter of 2011, and an increase of 133% over the fourth quarter 2010 dividend. This dividend policy is intended as a non-binding guideline which will be periodically reviewed and reassessed by the Board. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. 51 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Performance Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 10,358 $ 9,540 $ 7,705 Income from continuing operations $ 1,108 $ 3,144 $ 2,109 Net income $ 972 $ 3,116 $ 2,093 Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 366 $ 2,277 $ 1,297 Per common share, basic Income from continuing operations $ 1.02 $ 4.69 $ 2.68 Net income $ 0.74 $ 4.63 $ 2.66 Adjusted net income (1) $ 2,170 $ 1,893 $ 1,359 Adjusted net income per share (1) $ 4.39 $ 3.85 $ 2.79 Gold ounces produced (thousands) Consolidated 5,897 6,451 6,521 Attributable to Newmont (2) 5,185 5,392 5,237 Copper pounds produced (millions) Consolidated 352 600 504 Attributable to Newmont 206 327 227 Gold ounces sold (thousands) Consolidated 5,820 6,296 6,534 Attributable to Newmont 5,104 5,274 5,217 Copper pounds sold (millions) Consolidated 356 539 507 Attributable to Newmont 203 292 226 Average price realized, net Gold (per ounce) $ 1,562 $ 1,222 $ 977 Copper (per pound) $ 3.54 $ 3.43 $ 2.60 Costs applicable to sales (3) Gold (per ounce) $ 591 $ 485 $ 411 Copper (per pound) $ 1.26 $ 0.80 $ 0.64 Operating margin (1) Gold (per ounce) $ 971 $ 737 $ 566 Copper (per pound) $ 2.28 $ 2.63 $ 1.96 (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 83. (2) Includes 64 and 21 thousand ounces in 2011 and 2010, respectively, from our non-consolidated interest in La Zanja and 17 and 5 thousand ounces in 2011 and 2010, respectively, from our non-consolidated interest in Duketon and 32 thousand ounces from discontinued operations at Kori Kollo, Bolivia in 2009. (3) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . Consolidated Financial Performance Sales increased 9% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher average realized gold and copper prices, partially offset by fewer consolidated gold ounces and copper pounds sold. The average realized gold price increased 28% to $1,562 per ounce in 2011 from $1,222 per ounce in 2010. The average realized copper price, including $92 unfavorable mark to market adjustments on provisionally priced copper sales, increased 3% to $3.54 per pound in 2011 compared to $3.43 per pound in 2010. Gold ounces sold decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower production in Asia Pacific, 52 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION primarily Batu Hijau, and South America, partially offset by higher production in North America. Copper pounds sold decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower production at Batu Hijau, partially offset by higher production at Boddington. Costs applicable to sales increased 12% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher waste mining activities, higher milling and royalty costs, higher diesel prices and a stronger Australian dollar. Liquidity Our financial position was as follows: At December 31, 2011 2010 Debt $ 4,313 $ 4,441 Newmont stockholders equity $ 12,896 $ 13,345 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,760 $ 4,056 Investments $ 1,566 $ 1,681 During 2011, our debt and liquidity positions were affected by the following: Net cash provided from continuing operations of $3,591; Capital expenditures of $2,787; Acquisition of Fronteer for $2,257; Income and mining taxes paid of $1,526; Debt payments of $262, net; Dividends paid to common shareholders of $494; and Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of $117. Looking Forward We will continue to focus on operational and project excellence in 2012 to deliver on our plans and continue the advancement of our project pipeline, resulting in the following expectations for 2012: Attributable gold production of approximately 5.0 to 5.2 million ounces, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau as it continues with Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher production at Nevada and Ahafo; Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold of $625 to $675 due to lower production at Batu Hijau combined with higher expected costs for energy, labor and contracted services; Attributable copper production of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds, primarily due to the continuation of Phase 6 stripping at Batu Hijau, at Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold of approximately $1.80 to $2.20 due to lower production at Batu Hijau; Consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $4,000 to $4,300 in 2012, with approximately 60% to be spent on major project initiatives, including further development of Akyem in Ghana, the Tanami shaft in Australia and potentially Conga in Peru. The remaining 40% is expected to be spent on sustaining and maintenance capital; Exploration expense of approximately $400 to $430 focused primarily on Ahafo in Africa, Long Canyon in Nevada, Tanami in Australia and other projects in all regions; and Advanced projects, research and development expense of approximately $475 to $525 focused primarily on Merian in Suriname, Midas, Long Canyon and Vista Vein in Nevada, Chaquicocha underground in Peru, Elang in Indonesia and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa. 53 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Certain key factors will affect our future financial and operating results. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Our 2012 expectations, particularly with respect to production volumes and Costs applicable to sales per ounce or pound, may differ significantly from actual quarter and full year results due to variations in mine planning and sequencing, ore grades and hardness, metal recoveries, waste removal, commodity input prices and foreign currency exchange rates; and Future investments in the Akyem project in Ghana, the Conga project in Peru, the Long Canyon project in Nevada, the Merian project in Suriname and the Tanami shaft in Australia will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow may become insufficient to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices and our operational performance, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. In 2011, we entered into forward starting swap contracts with a total notional amount of $2,000. These contracts hedge movements in treasury rates related to an expected debt issuance in the first half of 2012. At December 31, 2011, the hedge contracts were in a liability position of $399. The proceeds from the expected debt issuance will be adjusted by the fair value of the swap contracts at the time of issuance. If the anticipated debt issuance does not proceed, we will be required to cash settle the swap contracts with the full amount of the payment charged against earnings. In 2011, the Company expressed the intent to exercise the early purchase option on the refractory ore treatment plant capital lease related to Mill 6 in Nevada. As a result, we anticipate aggregate principal payments of approximately $165 in 2012. Accounting Developments For a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. Amortization Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and 54 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the units-of-production ( UOP ) method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. Major development costs incurred after the commencement of production are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. The expected useful lives used in amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of amortization calculations. Carrying Value of Stockpiles Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of stockpiled material may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide ore stockpiles are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore, including applicable overhead and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed at each stockpile average cost per recoverable ounce of gold or pound of copper as material is processed. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, stockpiles had a total carrying value of $2,410 and $1,786, respectively. 55 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following is a summary of our ore stockpiles: At December 31, At December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 414 $ 324 $ 152 $ 175 Yanacocha 108 69 166 167 Boddington 345 192 467 348 Other Australia/New Zealand 161 145 338 308 Batu Hijau 185 142 287 172 Ahafo 173 121 314 307 Total/Weighted Average $ 1,386 $ 993 $ 239 $ 220 At December 31, At December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010 ($ in millions) ($ per pound) Copper Boddington $ 90 $ 56 $ 1.09 $ 0.95 Batu Hijau 934 737 0.67 0.47 Total/Weighted Average $ 1,024 $ 793 $ 0.69 $ 0.49 We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ( NRV ), and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2011 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.50 per pound and a U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00. If short-term and long-term metals prices decrease, the value of the stockpiles decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles to NRV. The NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Carrying Value of Ore on Leach Pads Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad. Estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads 56 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. Although the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of gold on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to NRV are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumptions in determining the NRV for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2011 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation included a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. If short-term and long-term gold prices decrease, the value of the ore on leach pads decrease, and it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to NRV. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, leach pads had a total carrying value of $532 and $588, respectively. The following is a summary of our ore on leach pads: At December 31, At December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010 ($ in millions) ($ per ounce) Gold Nevada $ 122 $ 155 $ 389 $ 431 La Herradura 6 6 535 526 Yanacocha 404 427 730 558 Total/Weighted Average $ 532 $ 588 $ 606 $ 517 Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset, including goodwill, if any. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, trends and related factors), production levels, operating costs, capital requirements and reclamation costs, all based on life-of-mine plans. The significant assumptions in determining the future cash flows for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2011 apart from production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, included a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, a long-term copper price of $3.50 per pound and U.S. to Australian dollar exchange rate of $1.00 per A$1.00. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairments of $2,084, $6, and $7, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of property, plant and mine development as part of Write-down of property, plant and mine development. Existing proven and probable reserves and value beyond proven and probable reserves, including mineralization other than proven and probable reserves are included when determining the fair value of mine site reporting units at acquisition and, subsequently, in determining whether the assets are impaired. The term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment. Estimates of 57 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION recoverable minerals from such exploration stage mineral interests are risk adjusted based on management relative confidence in such materials. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. As discussed above under Amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves. Additionally, production, capital and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. Derivative Instruments With the exception of the Call Spread Transactions (as described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the statements of consolidated income, except for the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, whereby the effective portion of changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. The derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges are designated against foreign currency expenditures, diesel purchases, or future debt interest payments where management believes the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to the statements of consolidated income immediately. Reclamation and Remediation Obligations Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and remediation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine. Reclamation obligations for inactive mines are accrued based on management best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred at a site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and 58 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required. Any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation. Income and Mining Taxes We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Refer above to Carrying Value of Long-Lived Assets for a discussion of the factors that could cause future cash flows to differ from estimates. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date. Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If an estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax expense . Consolidated Financial Results Gold Sales increased $1,404 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a $340 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges, partially offset by 476,000 fewer ounces sold. Gold Sales increased $1,306 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a $245 per ounce increase in the average realized price after treatment and refining charges, partially offset by 238,000 fewer ounces sold.

The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to a full year of Boddington production and higher mining and milling costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher silver by-product credits and a build-up of inventories and stockpiles. Costs applicable to sales for copper increased in 2011 from 2010 due to higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and milling costs at Boddington, partially offset by a higher allocation of costs to gold. The increase in 2010 from 2009 was due to higher production and waste mining costs at Batu Hijau and a full year of Boddington production. For a complete discussion regarding variations in operations, see Results of Consolidated Operations below. Amortization expense increased in 2011 from 2010 due to additional investments in mine development and equipment and higher asset retirement costs. Amortization expense increased in 2010 from 2009 due to a full year of Boddington production, additional equipment purchases and higher capitalized mine development. Amortization expense fluctuates as capital expenditures increase or decrease and as production levels increase or decrease due to the use of the units-of-production 62 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION amortization method for mineral interests and mine development. For a complete discussion, see Results of Consolidated Operations , below. We expect Amortization expense to be approximately $1,050 to $1,080 in 2012. The following is a summary of Costs applicable to sales and Amortization by operation: Costs Applicable to Sales Amortization Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Gold North America: Nevada $ 1,039 $ 974 $ 1,019 $ 277 $ 271 $ 261 La Herradura 110 73 42 20 19 11 1,149 1,047 1,061 297 290 272 South America: Yanacocha 711 630 642 234 162 168 Asia Pacific: Boddington 470 400 45 122 113 15 Batu Hijau 164 155 118 35 42 30 Kalgoorlie 235 211 210 17 15 15 Jundee 140 132 136 56 33 49 Tanami 205 173 174 40 43 47 Waihi 101 69 57 22 17 25 1,315 1,140 740 292 263 181 Africa: Ahafo 265 237 242 76 78 68 3,440 3,054 2,685 899 793 689 Copper Asia Pacific: Batu Hijau 332 337 307 71 90 78 Boddington 118 93 16 28 25 4 450 430 323 99 115 82 Other Hope Bay 14 13 12 Asia Pacific 3 2 3 Corporate and other 21 22 20 38 37 35 $ 3,890 $ 3,484 $ 3,008 $ 1,036 $ 945 $ 806 Exploration expense increased to $350 in 2011 from $218 in 2010 due to additional near mine expenditures in all regions, with the largest increases at Nevada, Yanacocha, Ahafo, Jundee and Tanami and increased regional expenditures at Long Canyon and Hope Bay. Exploration expense increased in 2010 from $187 in 2009 due to additional near mine expenditures in all regions, with the largest increase in Nevada at Leeville/Turf and Midas. We expect Exploration expense to increase to approximately $400 to $430 in 2012, focused primarily on Long Canyon in Nevada, Tanami in Australia and other projects in all other regions. 63 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION During 2011, we added 11.6 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.3 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Ahafo (2.7 million ounces), Carlin open pit, (2.3 million ounces), Phoenix (1.5 million ounces), Carlin underground (1.2 million ounces), Kalgoorlie (1.0 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in all regions (2.2 million ounces). The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 3.3 million ounces. During 2010, we added 8.2 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.5 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Leeville (1.8 million ounces), Ahafo (1.5 million ounces), Twin Creeks (1.4 million ounces), Phoenix (0.8 million ounces), La Herradura (0.7 million ounces) and Tanami (0.7 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in the United States, Australia and South America (1.8 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 0.5 million ounces at Akyem in Ghana, primarily due to new mining assumptions and higher cutoff grades. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million ounces. During 2009, we added 6.4 million ounces to proven and probable reserves, with 6.8 million ounces of depletion. Reserve additions were primarily due to conversion of mineralized material at Gold Quarry (2.9 million ounces), Boddington (1.3 million ounces), Tanami (0.5 million ounces) and Ahafo (0.5 million ounces) with most of the remaining additions coming from open pit and underground sources in Australia and South America (0.6 million ounces). Gold reserves were revised down by 0.3 million ounces at Phoenix in Nevada, primarily due to metallurgy, geology and modeling impacts. The estimated impact of the change in gold price assumption on these reserve additions was an increase of 1.7 million ounces. Advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and certain drilling costs. Advanced projects, research and development expense increased 73% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to increased spending to accelerate internal growth opportunities across our portfolio. Projects in North America include Hope Bay in Canada, the Nevada portfolio project including Long Canyon, Vista Vein and the Phoenix copper leach. Projects in South America include the Conga and Chaquicocha projects in Peru and the Merian gold project in Suriname. Projects in Asia Pacific include Elang in Indonesia. Projects in Africa include the Akyem gold project in Ghana and Subika expansion at Ahafo in Ghana. We expect Advanced projects, research and development expense to be approximately $475 to $525 in 2012 focused primarily on Merian in Suriname, Midas, Long Canyon and Vista Vein in Nevada, Chaquicocha underground in Peru, Elang in Indonesia and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa. 64 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 North America Nevada $ 24 $ 10 $ 14 La Herradura 2 Hope Bay 155 74 25 South America Yanacocha 19 15 7 Conga 20 8 4 Other South America 13 2 2 Asia Pacific Boddington 5 25 Batu Hijau 6 3 Other Australia/New Zealand 5 9 5 Africa Ahafo 10 11 2 Akyem 5 5 8 Corporate and Other Technical and project services 89 57 24 Corporate 20 22 19 $ 373 $ 216 $ 135 General and administrative expense increased to $198 in 2011 compared to $178 in 2010 due to higher benefit and compensation costs and higher consulting fees. General and administrative expense increased in 2010 compared to $159 in 2009 due to higher benefit and compensation costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage of Sales was 1.9% in 2011, compared to 1.9% and 2.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect General and administrative expense to be approximately $210 to $230 in 2012. Write-down of property, plant and mine development totaled $2,084, $6 and $7 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The write-down in 2011 is primarily related to the Hope Bay project that resulted from our decision to place the project on care and maintenance and to focus on environmental and regulatory compliance spending. We placed the Hope Bay project on care and maintenance after evaluating development options and economic feasibility for the project compared with other project and development opportunities within our wider project pipeline. The 2010 write-down is primarily related to asset impairments at Nevada and the 2009 write-down is primarily related to asset impairments at Batu Hijau. Other expense, net was $265, $261 and $358 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to Fronteer acquisition costs, an impairment of materials and supplies related to a decision to place the Hope Bay project on care and maintenance and higher regional and administration costs, partially offset by lower community development costs at Batu Hijau. The decrease in 2010 over 2009 is due to costs related to acquiring the remaining interest in Boddington in 2009, higher charges related to the Western Australian power plant in 2009, and a workforce reduction that impacted 3% of our global workforce in 2009, partially offset by higher community development costs at Batu Hijau in 2010. 65 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Other income, net was $12, $109 and $88 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in 2011 over 2010 is due to other-than-temporary impairment charges for marketable securities primarily acquired with the Fronteer acquisition of $180 in 2011, a decrease in Canadian Oil Sands dividends as well as the sale of non-core assets in 2010, partially offset by the gain on the sale of other marketable equity securities, an increase in income from developing projects and a decrease in foreign exchange losses. The increase in 2010 over 2009 is primarily related to an increase in Canadian Oil Sands dividends due to higher oil prices in 2010 and sales of non-core assets, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses. Interest expense, net was $244, $279 and $120 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled $52, $21 and $111 in each year, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the increase in capitalized interest for the advancement of our Conga and Akyem projects. Interest expense, net increased in 2010 from 2009 due to the reduction in capitalized interest as Boddington achieved commercial production in November 2009 and interest related to the 2019 and 2039 senior notes issued during September 2009, partially offset by lower interest due to the prepayment in 2010 of the PTNNT project financing and Yanacocha senior notes and credit facility. We expect Interest expense, net to be approximately $240 to $260 in 2012. Income and mining tax expense was $713, $856 and $829 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rates were 39%, 21% and 28% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The higher tax rate in 2011 is primarily due to the impairment related to the Hope Bay project and the impact it had on the realizability of our Canadian deferred tax assets. Without the write-down on the Hope Bay project, the annual effective tax rate would have been 30%. The impairment resulted in a 12% tax rate increase due to the recording of valuation allowances on Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by a 3% benefit from other items. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 is primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of check the box elections made with respect to certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of the elections, the subsidiaries are treated as flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Without the restructuring, the effective tax rate for 2010 would have been 32%. The factors that most significantly impacted our effective tax rates for the three periods are percentage depletion, changes in estimates of reserves for income tax uncertainties, valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, and the impact of certain specific transactions. Many of these factors are sensitive to the average realized price of gold and other metals. For a complete discussion, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a Technical Advice Memorandum ( TAM ) to the Company regarding the U.S. income tax treatment of the Price Capped Forward Sales Contracts settled in cash in 2007. The TAM provides guidance which is unfavorable to the Company. The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions through all processes available to it and believes it should prevail. Based on the uncertainty and inherent unpredictability of the factors influencing our effective tax rate and the sensitivity of such factors to gold and other metals prices as discussed above, the effective tax rate is expected to be volatile in future periods. The effective tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 32% in 2012. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Yanacocha $ 326 $ 292 $ 354 Batu Hijau 287 549 445 Other (7 ) (2 ) (3 ) $ 606 $ 839 $ 796 66 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased in 2011 from 2010 as a result of decreased earnings at Batu Hijau, partially offset by increased earnings at Yanacocha. The 2010 increase over 2009 was a result of higher earnings at Batu Hijau and the required March 2010 divestiture of shares in Batu Hijau, partially offset by lower earnings at Yanacocha and the additional 17% economic interest in Batu Hijau as a result of advancing funds to certain noncontrolling shareholders in exchange for an assignment of their Batu Hijau dividends, net of withholding tax. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our Batu Hijau ownership and economic interests. Equity income (loss) of affiliates was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Minera La Zanja S.R.L. (46.9%) $ 52 $ 10 $ (4 ) Euronimba Ltd. (43.5%) (41 ) (10 ) (17 ) AGR Matthey Joint Venture 3 5 $ 11 $ 3 $ (16 ) We have a 46.94% interest in Minera La Zanja, S.R.L. ( La Zanja ), a gold project near the city of Cajamarca, Peru. The remaining interest is held by Compa ia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. ( Buenaventura ). The mine commenced operations in September 2010 and is operated by Buenaventura. Newmont received dividends of $31 during 2011 from its interest in La Zanja. We have a 43.50% interest in Euronimba Ltd. ( Euronimba ), with the remaining interests held by BHP Billiton (43.50%) and Areva (13%). Euronimba owns 95% of the Nimba iron ore project located in the Republic of Guinea which is in the early stages of development. The AGR Matthey Joint Venture ( AGR ), a gold refinery in which Newmont held a 40% interest, was dissolved on March 30, 2010. Newmont received consideration of $14 from the dissolution and recorded a gain of $6 during 2010. Newmont received dividends of $7 and $2 during 2010 and 2009, respectively, from its interests in AGR. Loss from discontinued operations was as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ $ $ 32 Income from operations $ $ $ 1 Non-operating loss (143 ) (40 ) (44 ) Pre-tax loss (143 ) (40 ) (43 ) Income tax benefit 7 12 27 Loss from discontinued operations $ (136 ) $ (28 ) $ (16 ) Discontinued operations include Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property ( Holt property ) that was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. ( St. Andrew ) in 2006. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation ( Newmont Canada ) liable for a sliding scale royalty on production from the Holt property, which Newmont Canada appealed. In 2010, we recognized a $28 charge, net of tax benefits of $12, related to these legal claims. In 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court ruling resulting in an additional $136 charge, net of tax benefits of $7. In 2009, we sold our interest in Kori Kollo in Bolivia. As part of the transaction, a reclamation trust fund was established with the proceeds to be made available exclusively to pay for closure and reclamation costs when operations eventually cease. We recognized a $16 charge in 2009, net of tax benefits of $27, related to the sale. 67 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Other comprehensive loss, net of tax was $456 in 2011 and included non-cash adjustments for a $195 net loss in value of marketable securities primarily related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $8 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $60 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate and lower than expected return on plan assets, and a $209 net loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to a loss on forward starting swap contracts partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $484 in 2010 and included non-cash adjustments for a $269 net gain in value of marketable securities primarily related to Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Regis Resources Ltd., a $98 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $13 net loss related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a lower discount rate, and a $130 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $882 in 2009 and included non-cash adjustments for a $418 net gain in value of marketable securities related to Canadian Oil Sands Trust and Gabriel Resources Ltd., a $264 net gain on the translation of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, a $14 net gain related to pension and other post-retirement benefit adjustments primarily as a result of utilizing a higher discount rate, and a $186 net gain on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges due mainly to foreign currency hedge gains.

Consolidated copper pounds produced decreased 41% due to higher waste stripping in Phase 6 at Batu Hijau resulting in processing lower grade stockpiled material, partially offset by higher grade and throughput at Boddington. Attributable gold ounces produced decreased 4% due to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, partially offset by higher production from La Herradura. Lower attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 22% due to lower production from Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, higher royalty and waste mining costs, higher co-product allocation of costs to gold and a stronger Australian dollar, partially offset by higher silver and copper by-product credits. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold increased 58% due to lower production from Batu Hijau, higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, partially offset by lower co-product allocation of costs to copper. 2010 compared to 2009 Consolidated gold ounces produced decreased slightly due to: lower production from South America due to mine sequencing at Yanacocha resulting in increased waste mining, lower leach placement and lower mill ore grade; and lower production from North America due to completion of mining at Deep Post in 2009 and geotechnical issues at Gold Quarry in Nevada; mostly offset by higher production from Asia Pacific due to a full year of Boddington production and higher ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau; and higher production from Africa due to higher ore grade at Ahafo. Consolidated copper pounds produced increased 19% due to higher ore grade and throughput at Batu Hijau and a full year of Boddington production. Attributable gold ounces produced increased 3% due to higher production from Batu Hijau and a full year of production from Boddington, partially offset by lower production from Yanacocha and Nevada. Higher attributable copper pounds produced also resulted from higher production from Batu Hijau and full year of production from Boddington. 69 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Costs applicable to sales per consolidated gold ounce sold increased 18% due to lower production from South America, a full year of higher cost production at Boddington and higher diesel, royalty and waste mining costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. Costs applicable to sales per consolidated copper pound sold increased 25% due to higher waste mining at Batu Hijau and a full year of higher cost production at Boddington, partially offset by higher production at Batu Hijau. We expect 2012 gold production of approximately 5.0 to 5.2 million ounces attributable to Newmont, primarily due to lower production at Batu Hijau as it continues to process lower grade stockpiled ore during Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher production at Nevada and Ahafo. Consolidated Costs applicable to sales per ounce for 2012 are expected to be approximately $625 to $675 due to lower production at Batu Hijau combined with higher expected costs for energy, labor and contracted services. We expect 2012 copper production attributable to Newmont of approximately 150 to 170 million pounds at consolidated Costs applicable to sales per pound of approximately $1.80 to $2.20 due to lower production at Batu Hijau.

Gold and copper production increased 2% and 19%, respectively, due to higher mill throughput and higher copper grade, partially offset by lower recoveries and lower gold grade. Costs applicable to sales increased 16% per ounce and 9% per pound, respectively, due to higher mining and mill maintenance costs, higher royalty costs and a stronger Australian dollar, net of hedging gains, partially offset by higher production and higher silver by-product credits. Changes in Australia exchange rates increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce by $33 and per pound by $0.08. Costs applicable to sales and Amortization per ounce and per pound were also impacted by a higher allocation of costs to gold. Batu Hijau, Indonesia . Copper and gold production decreased 48% and 57%, respectively, due to lower throughput, grade and recovery as a result of processing more stockpiled material, compared to a higher proportion of high grade Phase 5 ore in 2010, and mill down time from motor replacements during the second and third quarters of 2011. Waste tons mined increased 135% as Phase 6 waste removal continues as planned. The Company expects to process primarily stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed in late 2013. Costs applicable to sales increased 61% per pound and 101% per ounce due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor. Amortization increased 26% per pound and 62% per ounce due to equipment additions and lower production. Costs applicable to sales and Amortization per pound and per ounce were also impacted by a higher allocation of costs to gold. Other Australia/New Zealand.

Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper at Costs applicable to sales of $590 per ounce and $1.86 per pound. As Boddington continued to ramp-up in 2010, production was below original expectations due to lower than anticipated gold grade and mill throughput. Costs applicable to sales were higher than expected due to higher mining and mill maintenance costs. Changes in Australia exchange rates increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce and per pound by $59 and $0.19, respectively. Amortization per ounce was higher than expected due to lower production. Batu Hijau, Indonesia . Copper and gold production increased 10% and 32%, respectively, due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore, partially offset by lower recovery. Unseasonably dry weather permitted additional mining in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% per pound and per ounce due to higher waste mining and milling costs, including higher labor and diesel costs. Amortization increased 19% per pound and 15% per ounce due to equipment additions, partially offset by higher production. Other Australia/New Zealand. Gold production decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by higher grade, throughput and recovery at Kalgoorlie.

Gold ounces produced increased 4% due to higher throughput and recovery. Ore tons mined increased 28% from a full year of production at Amoma. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 5% due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production. Amortization per ounce decreased 9% due to higher production. 2010 compared to 2009 Ahafo, Ghana. Gold ounces produced increased due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu in 2010 and the commencement of production at Amoma in October 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased slightly due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production. Amortization per ounce increased 20% due to higher capitalized mine development and equipment additions. Gold production for the Africa operations is expected to increase in 2012 to approximately 570,000 to 600,000 ounces due to higher ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per ounce of approximately $500 to $550 are expected for 2012, primarily as a result of higher mining and milling costs. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and Costs applicable to sales to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Approximately 43%, 36% and 24% of our Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our Costs applicable to sales are most significantly impacted by variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. We estimate that every $0.10 increase in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate increases annually the U.S. dollar Costs applicable to sales by approximately $90 for each ounce of gold sold from operations in Australia before taking into account the impact of currency hedging. However, variations in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate historically have been strongly correlated to variations in the U.S. dollar gold price over the long-term. Changes in costs at Australian locations due to exchange rate changes have therefore tended to be mitigated by changes in sales reported in U.S. dollars at Australian locations. No assurance, however, can be given that the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate will continue to be strongly correlated to the U.S. dollar gold price in the future. 74 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Variations in foreign currency exchange rates increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $9, net of hedging, in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased Costs applicable to sales per ounce $10, net of hedging, in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to movements in the Australian dollar. We hedge a portion of our forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. At December 31, 2011, we have hedged 76%, 62%, 46%, 26% and 10% of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, at an average rate of 0.91, 0.92, 0.89, 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our determination of proven and probable reserves. However, if a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Australian dollar, and/or to other foreign currencies that impact our cost structure, were not mitigated by offsetting increases in the U.S. dollar gold price or by other factors, the amount of proven and probable reserves in the applicable foreign country could be reduced as certain proven and probable reserves may no longer be economic. The extent of any such reduction would be dependent on a variety of factors including the length of time of any such weakening of the U.S. dollar, and management long-term view of the applicable exchange rate. Future reductions of proven and probable reserves would primarily result in reduced gold or copper sales and increased amortization and, depending on the level of reduction, could also result in impairments of property, plant and mine development, mineral interests and/or goodwill. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided from Operations Net cash provided from continuing operations was $3,591, $3,180 and $2,914 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and was impacted by the following key factors: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Consolidated gold ounces sold (in thousands) 5,820 6,296 6,534 Average price received per ounce of gold, net $ 1,562 $ 1,222 $ 977 Costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold (1) (591 ) (485 ) (411 ) Operating margin per ounce of gold (2) $ 971 $ 737 $ 566 Consolidated copper pounds sold (in millions) 356 539 507 Average price received per pound of copper, net $ 3.54 $ 3.43 $ 2.60 Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper (1) (1.26 ) (0.80 ) (0.64 ) Operating margin per pound of copper (2) $ 2.28 $ 2.63 $ 1.96 (1) Excludes Amortization and Reclamation and remediation . (2) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 83. Net cash provided from continuing operations was a record $3,591 in 2011, an increase of $411 from 2010 due to higher realized gold prices resulting in an increase in gold operating margin and a lower increase in working capital of $443 (trade receivables, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities); partially offset by higher Costs applicable to sales resulting in a decrease in copper operating margin and lower gold and copper sales volumes as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results. The increase was also partially offset by higher investments in advanced projects of $157 and exploration of $132 and higher current income and mining tax expense of $148. Cash flow provided from operations during 2010 was $3,180, an increase of $266 from 2009 due to higher realized gold and copper prices resulting in an increase in operating margins and increased consolidated copper sales volume; partially offset by 75 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION decreased gold sales volume as discussed above in Consolidated Financial Results. The increase was also partially offset by higher Costs applicable to sales , primarily from a full year of Boddington operations, higher interest expense of $159, higher current income and mining tax expense of $408, and an additional $527 investment in working capital (trade receivables, inventories, stockpiles and ore on leach pads).

We also received $34 from the sale of other assets including non-core assets held at Tanami. During 2009, proceeds included $14 for the sale of other mining projects. Financing Activities Net cash provided from (used in) financing activities of continuing operations was $(854) in 2011, compared to $(915) and $2,572 in 2010 and 2009, respectively, for the reasons explained below. Proceeds from debt, net. During 2011, we borrowed $2,041 under our revolving credit facility and paid debt issuance costs of $30. During 2009, we received proceeds from debt of $4,299, including $1,756 under our revolving credit facility, $1,080 net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes due in 2039, $895 net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes due in 2019, $504 net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes due in 2012 and $64 from other credit facilities. At December 31, 2011, $244 of the $2,500 revolving credit facility was used to secure the issuance of letters of credit, primarily supporting reclamation obligations (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below) and $33 was used in outstanding borrowings. Repayment of debt . During 2011, we repaid $2,273 of debt, including repayment of $2,008 under our revolving credit facility and scheduled debt repayments of $223 for our 8 5/8% debentures, $30 related to the sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant (classified as a capital lease) and $12 on other credit facilities and capital leases.

Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $689 in 2012, $10 in 2013, $522 in 2014, $10 in 2015, $43 in 2016 and $3,039 thereafter. We expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from Net cash provided by operating activities , short-term investments, existing cash balances, available credit facilities and an expected debt issuance in the first half of 2012. 78 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with all required debt covenants and other restrictions related to our debt agreements. Proceeds from stock issuance, net. We received proceeds of $40, $60 and $1,278 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the issuance of common stock. In February 2009, we completed a public offering of 34,500,000 shares of common stock at $37 per share for net proceeds of $1,236. Sale of noncontrolling interests. In March 2010, November 2009 and December 2009, NTPBV completed the sale of 7%, 10% and 7%, respectively, of shares in PTNNT to a third party buyer. These transactions reduced our ownership interest in PTNNT to 31.5%. Cash proceeds from the 2010 and 2009 sales were $229 and $638, respectively, with our 56.25% share being $129 and $359, respectively, and the remaining balances paid to our NTPBV partner. Acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In June 2010, PTPI, an unrelated noncontrolling shareholder of PTNNT, completed the sale of a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PTIMI. To enable the transaction to proceed, we released our rights to the dividends payable on this 2.2% interest and released our security interest in the associated shares. We agreed to advance certain funds to PTIMI to enable it to purchase the 2.2% interest in exchange for (i) a pledge of their share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, and (iii) a commitment to support the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. The funds that we advanced to PTIMI and which it paid to PTPI for the shares were used by PTPI to reduce its outstanding loan balance with us. Upon completion of this transaction, PTPI requested and was allowed to make additional draw-downs under our agreement with PTPI. Our economic interest in PTPI and PTIMI combined 20% ownership interest in PTNNT remains at 17% and did not change as a result of these transactions. In December 2009, we entered into a transaction with PTPI whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for (i) a pledge of its 20% share of PTNNT, (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax, (iii) a commitment to support the application of Newmont standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine, and (iv) as of September 16, 2011, powers of attorney to vote and sell PTNNT shares in support of the pledge, enforceable in the event of default as further security for the funding. As a result, our effective economic interest in PTNNT increased by 17%. Dividends paid to noncontrolling interests. We paid dividends of $117, $462 and $394 to noncontrolling interests during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The payments in 2011 included $15 of Indonesian withholding taxes related to dividends paid to noncontrolling interests in December 2010. The dividends paid in 2010 and 2009, included $100 and $279, respectively, for our NTPBV partner share of the interest sold in Batu Hijau during those years. Dividends paid to common stockholders. We paid annual dividends of $1.00, $0.50 and $0.40 per common share during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additionally, Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, paid annual dividends of C$1.00, C$0.52 and C$0.46 during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On February 22, 2012, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, payable March 30, 2012 to holders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2012. Total dividends paid to common stockholders were $494, $246 and $196 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Discontinued Operations Net operating cash provided from (used in) discontinued operations was $(7) in 2011, compared to $(13) and $33 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Discontinued operations in 2011 relate to payments on the Holt property royalty. The 2010 and 2009 amounts related to the Kori Kollo operation in Bolivia which was sold in 2009. 79 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations was $2 in 2009 for repayment of debt at Kori Kollo. Corporate Revolving Credit Facility Effective May 20, 2011, the Company entered into a new uncollateralized $2,500 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. This new revolving credit facility replaced the existing revolving credit facility which was cancelled upon the effectiveness of the new facility. The new facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars and contains a letter of credit sub-facility. The new facility matures in May 2016. Facility fees vary based on the credit ratings of the Company senior, uncollateralized, long-term debt. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a market based rate plus a margin determined by the Company credit rating. At December 31, 2011, we had $33 borrowings outstanding under the facility. There was $244 and $153 outstanding in letters of credit at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Subsidiary Financings PTNNT Revolving Credit Facility Effective May 27, 2011, PTNNT entered into a new $600 reducing revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This new reducing revolving facility provides for borrowings in U.S. dollars. The facility matures in March 2017. The facility is non-recourse to Newmont and substantially all of PTNNT assets are pledged as collateral. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 4.00%. Commitment fees currently accrue on the daily average unused amount of the commitment of each lender at an annual rate of 2.00%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2011. Debt Covenants The Company senior notes and sale-leaseback of the refractory ore treatment plant debt facilities contain various covenants and default provisions including payment defaults, limitation on liens, limitation on sales and leaseback agreements and merger restrictions. The Ahafo project facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income and mining taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio of less than or equal to 4.0 and a net debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. In addition to the covenants noted above, the corporate revolving credit facility contains a financial ratio covenant requiring the Company to maintain a net debt (total debt net of cash and cash equivalents) to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to 62.5%. Furthermore, the corporate revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting the sale of all or substantially all of the Company assets, certain change of control provisions and a negative pledge on certain assets. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults. Shelf Registration Statement In September 2009, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 which enables the Company to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices. It also included the resale of an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities. 80 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt (1) $ 7,374 $ 701 $ 1,038 $ 815 $ 4,820 Capital lease obligations (2) 168 167 1 Reclamation and remediation obligations (3) 1,959 72 214 152 1,521 Employee-related benefits (4) 657 71 136 84 366 Uncertain income tax liabilities and interest (5) 88 88 Operating leases 100 23 40 20 17 Minimum royalty payments 362 28 83 55 196 Purchase obligations (6) 725 142 188 89 306 Other (7) 884 258 482 70 74 $ 12,317 $ 1,462 $ 2,182 $ 1,285 $ 7,388 (1) Amounts represent principal ($4,147) and estimated interest payments ($3,227) assuming no early extinguishment. (2) Amounts represent principal ($166) and estimated interest payments ($2) which includes the early buy-out option of the refractory ore treatment plant discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these reclamation and remediation obligations are reflected here. For more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefits include severance, workers participation, pension and other benefit plans. Pension plan benefit payments beyond 2016 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. (5) We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments beyond 2012 due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. (6) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. (7) Other includes accrued Boddington contingent consideration of $54, the accrued Holt royalty of $176 and other obligations which are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements including labor and service contracts. Payments related to derivative contracts cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as disclosed in the above table) and $1,354 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 81 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION We also have sales agreements to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in thousands of tons): 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Batu Hijau 327 344 518 Boddington 220 243 154 154 154 253 Nevada 75 622 587 672 154 154 253 For information regarding these copper sales agreements, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Hedging, Provisional Copper and Gold Sales, below. Future Cash Flows We anticipate significant future capital expenditures (see Investing Activities, above), funding of exploration and advanced projects, debt repayments and dividends to both common shareholders and noncontrolling interests will impact Net cash used in investing activities and Net cash used in financing activities and exceed Net cash provided by operations . Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. For information on our long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2011, we entered into forward starting swaps position amounts with a total notional value of $2,000. These swaps hedge movements in treasury rates related to an expected debt issuance in the first half of 2012. At December 31, 2011, the hedge contracts were in a liability position of $399. The proceeds from the expected debt issuance will be impacted by the fair value of the swap contracts at the time of issuance. If the anticipated debt issuance does not proceed, we will be required to cash settle the swap contracts with the full amount of the payment charged against earnings. Cash flows are expected to be impacted by variations in the realized prices of gold and copper. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided by operations to metal prices, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Cash flows are also expected to be impacted by variations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Australian dollar. Accordingly, we have entered into derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of Costs applicable to sales in Asia Pacific. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Results of Consolidated Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, above. For information on the sensitivity of our Net cash provided from operations to foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Net cash provided from operations will also be impacted in 2012 as a result of planned contributions of $35 for our post-retirement benefit programs. Based on expected attributable production of between 5.0 and 5.2 million ounces of gold and between 150 and 170 million pounds of copper in 2012, we do not anticipate reasonably expected 82 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION variations in our production profile alone to influence our ability to pay our debt and other obligations in 2012. Environmental Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $1,070 and $904, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently, recently producing or developmental stage mineral properties, of which $47 is classified as a current liability. For more information on the Company reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $170 and $144 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We spent $15, $23 and $20 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for environmental obligations related to former, primarily historic, mining activities, and have classified $24 as a current liability. Expenditures for 2011 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada which was acquired as part of the Miramar acquisition, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, which is a legacy Normandy site and the Dawn mill site in Washington State. Expenditures for 2010 related primarily to the Con mine in Canada, the Mt. Leyshon property in Australia, the Dawn mill site in Washington State and Resurrection, a mine site in Leadville, Colorado. Expenditures for 2009 related primarily to Grass Valley in California, the Mt. Leyshon property, the Dawn mill site and the Con mine. For more information on the Company obligations associated with former mining activities, see Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in capital expenditures were $172, $118 and $131 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. Ongoing costs to comply with environmental regulations have not been a significant component of Costs applicable to sales . Forward-Looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1, Business. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income Management of the Company uses Adjusted net income to evaluate the Company operating performance, and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding exceptional or unusual items. Management determination of the components of Adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry 83 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION analysts. Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 366 $ 2,277 $ 1,297 Hope Bay impairment 1,609 Loss from discontinued operations 136 28 11 Other impairments/asset sales 105 (35 ) (8 ) Acquisition costs 18 44 Boddington contingent consideration 1 1 15 PTNNT community contribution 13 Income tax planning, net (65 ) (391 ) Adjusted net income $ 2,170 $ 1,893 $ 1,359 Net income per share $ 0.74 $ 4.63 $ 2.66 Adjusted net income per share $ 4.39 $ 3.85 $ 2.79 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on both a consolidated and attributable to Newmont basis. Attributable costs applicable to sales are based on our economic interest in production from our mines. For operations where we hold less than a 100% economic share in the production, we exclude the share of gold or copper production attributable to the noncontrolling interest. We include attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to provide management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce measures the benefit of copper produced in conjunction with gold, as a credit against the cost of producing gold. A number of other gold producers present their costs net of the contribution from copper and other non-gold sales. We believe that including a measure on this basis provides management, investors and analysts with information with which to compare our performance to other gold producers, and to better assess the overall performance of our business. In addition, this measure provides information to enable investors and analysts to understand the importance of non-gold revenues to our cost structure. 84 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound Gold Copper Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Costs applicable to sales: Consolidated per financial statements $ 3,440 $ 3,054 $ 2,685 $ 450 $ 430 $ 323 Noncontrolling interests (1) (442 ) (395 ) (391 ) (171 ) (169 ) (174 ) Attributable to Newmont $ 2,998 $ 2,659 $ 2,294 $ 279 $ 261 $ 149 Gold/Copper sold (thousand ounces/million pounds): Consolidated 5,820 6,296 6,534 356 539 507 Noncontrolling interests (1) (795 ) (1,043 ) (1,317 ) (153 ) (246 ) (281 ) Attributable to Newmont 5,025 5,253 5,217 203 293 226 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound: Consolidated $ 591 $ 485 $ 411 $ 1.26 $ 0.80 $ 0.64 Attributable to Newmont $ 597 $ 506 $ 440 $ 1.37 $ 0.89 $ 0.66 85 Table of Contents NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Attributable costs applicable to sales: Gold $ 2,998 $ 2,659 $ 2,294 Copper 279 261 149 3,277 2,920 2,443 Copper revenue: Consolidated (1,262 ) (1,848 ) (1,319 ) Noncontrolling interests (1) 542 847 730 (720 ) (1,001 ) (589 ) Net attributable costs applicable to sales $ 2,557 $ 1,919 $ 1,854 Attributable gold ounces sold (thousands) 5,025 5,253 5,217 Net attributable costs applicable to sales per ounce $ 509 $ 365 $ 355 (1) Relates to partners interests in Batu Hijau and Yanacocha. Operating margin per ounce/pound Operating margin per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by subtracting the costs applicable to sales per ounce of gold and per pound of copper from the average realized gold price per ounce and copper price per pound, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Operating margin per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.
