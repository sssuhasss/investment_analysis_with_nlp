ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The consolidated financial statements of Humana Inc. in this document present the Company financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis. References to we, us, our, Company, and Humana mean Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. This discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, investor presentations, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update these factors in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except as required by law. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward looking events discussed in this document might not occur. There may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Overview Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nation largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2006 revenues of $21.4 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and consumer-choice plans for government-sponsored programs, employer groups, and individuals. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 11.3 million members in our medical benefit programs, as well as approximately 1.9 million members in our specialty products programs. We manage our business with two segments: Government and Commercial. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government-sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, TRICARE, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes two lines of business: medical (fully and self insured) and specialty. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of SFAS 131 , which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We believe our customer, membership, revenue and pretax income diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success. We adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment , or SFAS 123R, on January 1, 2006. We have adjusted prior period amounts to reflect the effect of expensing stock awards under the modified retrospective application method of SFAS 123R as discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our results are impacted by many factors, but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive 31 Table of Contents premium, ASO fee, and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs. Medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces, including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures, increasing capacity and supply of medical services, new prescription drugs and therapies, an aging population, lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking, the tort liability system, and government regulations. Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. MER, which is computed by taking total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The SG&A expense ratio, which is computed by taking total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. Government Segment Our strategy and commitment to the expanded Medicare programs, including new product choices and pharmacy benefits for seniors, led to substantial growth during 2006. Medicare Advantage membership increased to 1,002,600 members at December 31, 2006, up 79.7% from 557,800 members at December 31, 2005, primarily due to sales of our PFFS product. Our new Medicare stand-alone PDP products added 3,536,600 members during 2006. Medicare premium revenues more than doubled to $11.5 billion during 2006 primarily as a result of this membership growth. Pretax earnings in the Government segment of $513.8 million in 2006 were 62% higher than 2005. This increase resulted primarily from the membership and associated revenue growth in our Medicare Advantage plans, partially offset by results for the new Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings. Our Complete stand-alone PDP offering, one of three stand-alone PDP offerings representing 12% of our stand-alone PDP membership, operated at a loss with a MER of 116% in 2006. The reason for the operating loss primarily related to the product design, including covering brand name prescription drugs in the coverage gap. The coverage gap represents the stage of coverage where the member would be responsible for the cost under a standard plan. The Complete stand-alone PDP offering was re-designed for 2007. In addition, the new stand-alone PDP benefit designs impacted our quarterly earnings pattern. These benefit designs result in coverage that varies as a member cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member plan period as specified under the standard plan defined by CMS. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages of a member plan period and less in the later stages for the plans which comprise the majority of our membership. This generally produces results that improve as the year progresses. For example, during 2006 our Standard and Enhanced stand-alone PDP offerings resulted in an MER of 97.7% during the first quarter, improving to 74.7% during the fourth quarter. Commercial Segment Commercial segment medical membership increased 113,000 members, or 3.6% from December 31, 2005 to 3,283,800 at December 31, 2006 as a result of the May 1, 2006 CHA acquisition which added 88,400 members and higher ASO, individual and consumer-choice membership, partially offset by a decline in our fully insured group membership. ASO membership at December 31, 2006 was up 31% from December 31, 2005. Individual membership increased 15% and consumer-choice membership increased 13% during 2006. These three areas, together with our small group business, now represent more than 84% of our Commercial medical membership. Other Highlights Year over year comparisons have been impacted by litigation and Hurricane Katrina expenses in 2005 that did not recur in 2006, as more fully discussed in the next section. 32 Table of Contents Cash flows from operations increased $1,076.6 million to $1,686.7 million for 2006 compared to $610.1 million for 2005 primarily due to Medicare enrollment growth, improved earnings and the impact of our new Part D offering. Our operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the Part D provisions of our Medicare contracts, including $738.7 million in estimated net amounts owed to CMS under the Part D risk corridor provisions which are expected to be settled in mid-2007. Net gains of $75.7 million from sales of venture capital investments contributed to investment income during 2006. The effective income tax rate was 36.0% for 2006 compared to 26.3% for 2005. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 primarily reflects the favorable impact from the resolution of a contingent gain of $22.8 million. We issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016 in May 2006, replaced our existing 5-year $600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a new 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement in July 2006, and repaid our $300 million of 7.25% senior notes in August 2006. These transactions are more fully described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements. 2005 Settlement of Class Action Litigation On October 17, 2005, we reached an agreement with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians to settle a nationwide class action suit. In connection with the settlement and other related litigation costs, we recorded pretax administrative expenses of $71.9 million ($44.8 million after taxes, or $0.27 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2005. Of the $71.9 million, $33.4 million was included in the Government segment results and the remaining $38.5 million was included in the Commercial segment results. These amounts were paid in 2006. 2005 Hurricane Katrina Certain of our operations, primarily the Louisiana market, were negatively affected by the impact of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Expenses related to Hurricane Katrina primarily stemmed from our efforts, in cooperation with Departments of Insurance in the affected states, to help our members by offering participating-provider benefits at non-participating providers rates, paying claims for members who were unable at the time to meet their premium obligations and similar measures. In connection with Hurricane Katrina, we recorded pretax medical and administrative expenses of $27.0 million ($16.9 million after taxes, or $0.10 per diluted common share) during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Of the $27.0 million, $5.9 million was included in the Government segment results and the remaining $21.1 million was included in the Commercial segment results. Recent Acquisitions On May 1, 2006, our Commercial segment acquired CHA Service Company, or CHA Health, a health plan serving employer groups in Kentucky, for cash consideration of $67.5 million, including a $1.7 million contingent purchase price settlement paid in January 2007. This acquisition strengthens our position in the Kentucky market. The acquisition of CHA Health added approximately 60,100 fully insured group members and 28,300 ASO members to our Commercial segment medical membership. This transaction did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations for 2006. 33 Table of Contents On December 20, 2005, our Commercial segment acquired Corphealth, Inc., a behavioral health care management company, for cash consideration of approximately $54.0 million. This acquisition allows Humana to integrate coverage of medical and behavior health benefits. On February 16, 2005, we acquired CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, or CarePlus, as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately $444.9 million in cash, adding approximately 50,400 Medicare Advantage members in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. This acquisition enhances our Medicare market position in South Florida. On April 1, 2004, we acquired Ochsner Health Plan, or Ochsner, from the Ochsner Clinic Foundation for $157.1 million in cash. Ochsner, a Louisiana health plan, added approximately 152,600 commercial medical members, primarily in fully insured large group accounts, and approximately 33,100 members in the Medicare Advantage program. During 2006, we paid $5.8 million in contingent purchase price settlements related to the Corphealth, CarePlus, and Ochsner acquisitions. These transactions are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 , or FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive, annual, tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48, which became effective for us beginning January 1, 2007, requires the change in net assets that results from the application of the new accounting model to be reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans , or SFAS 158. We adopted SFAS 158 prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2006 for the year ending December 31, 2006. SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position and revises certain disclosure requirements. The benefit obligation is defined as the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and as the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on our financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require new fair value measurements. We are required to adopt SFAS 157 in the first quarter of 2008. We currently are evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157, however, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2006 and 2005 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Change 2006 2005 Dollars Percentage (dollars in thousands) Premium revenues: Medicare Advantage $ 8,499,064 $ 4,590,362 $ 3,908,702 85.2 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,050,304 3,050,304 100.0 % Total Medicare 11,549,368 4,590,362 6,959,006 151.6 % TRICARE 2,543,930 2,407,653 136,277 5.7 % Medicaid 520,520 548,714 (28,194 ) (5.1 )% Total Government 14,613,818 7,546,729 7,067,089 93.6 % Fully insured 5,704,378 6,068,115 (363,737 ) (6.0 )% Specialty 410,986 386,747 24,239 6.3 % Total Commercial 6,115,364 6,454,862 (339,498 ) (5.3 )% Total $ 20,729,182 $ 14,001,591 $ 6,727,591 48.0 % Administrative services fees: Government $ 49,442 $ 50,059 $ (617 ) (1.2 )% Commercial 291,769 209,378 82,391 39.4 % Total $ 341,211 $ 259,437 $ 81,774 31.5 % Income before income taxes(a): Government $ 513,845 $ 316,676 $ 197,169 62.3 % Commercial 248,240 86,204 162,036 188.0 % Total $ 762,085 $ 402,880 $ 359,205 89.2 % Medical expense ratios(b): Government 85.0 % 83.1 % 1.9 % Commercial 81.7 % 83.3 % (1.6 )% Total 84.0 % 83.2 % 0.8 % SG&A expense ratios(a)(c): Government 11.8 % 12.7 % (0.9 )% Commercial 20.2 % 18.5 % 1.7 % Total 14.3 % 15.4 % (1.1 )% (a) Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the expensing of stock awards under the modified retrospective application method of SFAS 123R as more fully discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Summary Net income was $487.4 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2006 compared to $296.7 million, or $1.79 per diluted common share, in 2005. Net income for 2005 included expenses resulting from the physician class action settlement ($44.8 million after taxes, or $0.27 per diluted common share) and costs associated with Hurricane Katrina ($16.9 million after taxes, or $0.10 per diluted common share) described previously. Net income for 2005 also included the beneficial effect of an effective tax rate of approximately 26.3% compared to 36.0% in 2006, primarily due to the resolution of a contingent gain ($22.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share) during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year. After considering litigation and Hurricane Katrina expenses and the favorable tax gain contingency in 2005, the remaining year over year improvement in 2006 results from earnings increases in both the Government and Commercial segments. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Premium revenues increased 48.0% to $20.7 billion for 2006, compared to $14.0 billion for 2005. Higher Government segment premium revenues were partially offset by a decrease in Commercial segment premium revenues. Premium revenues reflect higher enrollment in our Medicare Advantage plans and the addition of our stand-alone PDP business. Government segment premium revenues increased $7.1 billion, or 93.6% to $14.6 billion for 2006, compared to $7.5 billion for 2005. This increase primarily was attributable to the expanded participation in various Medicare products and geographic markets. Sales of our PFFS products drove the majority of the 79.7% 36 Table of Contents increase in Medicare Advantage members since December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, approximately 47% of the company Medicare Advantage members were in PFFS plans versus 22% at December 31, 2005. Additionally, our new Medicare stand-alone PDP products added 3,536,600 members and $3.1 billion in new premium revenues during 2006. Medicaid membership increased 111,200 members from December 31, 2005 due primarily to the award of a new Puerto Rico regional ASO contract in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by eligible Puerto Rico Medicaid members choosing to move into the Medicare program. Commercial segment premium revenues decreased 5.3% to $6.1 billion for 2006 compared to $6.5 billion for 2005. Lower premium revenues primarily resulted from a reduction of fully insured membership. Our fully insured membership decreased 12.3%, or 245,600 members, to 1,754,200 at December 31, 2006 compared to 1,999,800 at December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of continued attrition within the fully insured group accounts, partially offset by membership gains from the CHA acquisition, and membership increases in the individual and consumer-choice product lines. Attrition in the fully insured group accounts results from a competitive pricing environment. Average per member premiums for our fully insured group medical members increased approximately 5.7% from 2005 to 2006. The average per member premium increase reflects a shift in the mix in our fully insured group membership from large groups to individuals and small groups as large groups continue to move to an administrative services only offering. Average per member premiums are lower for individuals and small groups than large groups. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees for 2006 were $341.2 million, an increase of $81.8 million, or 31.5%, from $259.4 million for 2005. The increase was due to increases in our Commercial segment administrative services fees. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $82.4 million, or 39.4%, from $209.4 million for 2005 to $291.8 million for 2006. This increase resulted from increased membership. ASO membership of 1,171,000 members at December 31, 2005 increased 30.6% to 1,529,600 at December 31, 2006. Average per member fees increased approximately 19% in 2006. ASO fees from our Commercial segment represent 86% of total ASO fees. Investment Income Investment income totaled $291.9 million for 2006, an increase of $148.9 million from $143.0 million for 2005. The increase in investment income for 2006 primarily resulted from higher venture capital gains, and higher average invested balances and interest rates. Investment income for 2006 includes $75.7 million in net realized gains related to venture capital investments compared to $5.7 million in 2005. Other Revenue Other revenue totaled $54.3 million for 2006, an increase of $40.2 million from $14.1 million for 2005. The increase primarily was attributable to revenue from our new in-house mail order pharmacy operations in 2006. Medical Expense Consolidated medical expense was $17.4 billion for 2006, an increase of $5.7 billion, or 48.7%, from $11.7 billion for 2005. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in the number of members, particularly higher cost Medicare members, and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation. The consolidated MER for 2006 was 84.0%, an 80 basis point increase from 83.2% for 2005. Higher medical expenses from Hurricane Katrina increased the 2005 MER 20 basis points. An improvement in the Commercial segment MER was more than offset by a higher Government segment MER impacted by the new Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings. 37 Table of Contents The Government segment medical expenses increased $6.2 billion, or 98.1%, during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of Medicare members, including those enrolled in our stand-alone PDPs. The Government segment MER for 2006 was 85.0%, a 190 basis point increase from 2005 of 83.1%. The increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of the stand-alone PDPs in January 2006 with an MER of 92.5% for 2006. The stand-alone PDP MER was negatively impacted by an MER in our Complete plan of 115.9% for 2006, one of three stand-alone PDP offerings representing approximately 12% of our stand-alone PDP members. We expect MER to improve in 2007 to approximately 82% to 84% for our combined Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP offerings. The Commercial segment medical expenses decreased $382.3 million, or 7.1%, from 2005 to 2006. This decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs. The increase in average per member claims costs for fully insured group members was approximately 6% for 2006 and is expected to range from 5% to 6% for 2007. The MER for the Commercial segment of 81.7% in 2006 decreased 160 basis points from 2005 MER of 83.3%. Higher medical expenses from Hurricane Katrina increased the 2005 MER 30 basis points. The decrease in MER primarily reflects improving medical cost utilization trends and an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fully insured block. Individual and smaller group accounts generally carry a lower MER than larger group accounts. SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $825.9 million, or 37.6%, during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees and increased sales and marketing costs due to the Medicare expansion offset by prior year litigation expenses which did not recur in 2006. The number of employees increased by 3,600 to 22,300 from 18,700 at December 31, 2005, primarily in the customer service and marketing functions associated with the growth in the Medicare business. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2006 was 14.3%, decreasing 110 basis points from 15.4% for 2005. Expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005. After considering the effects of the litigation settlement, the remaining decrease resulted from growth in revenues from higher average medical membership outpacing the related increase in administrative spending on a consolidated basis during 2006. Our Government and Commercial segments bear direct and indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Government segment SG&A expenses of $1,730.2 million for 2006 increased $766.9 million, or 79.6%, from 2005. The increase primarily resulted from higher expenses associated with the infrastructure build out of our expanded Medicare offerings in the latter half of 2005 through the first half of 2006 as well as increased sales and marketing costs in 2006 also related to the Medicare expansion. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 90 basis points from 12.7% for 2005 to 11.8% for 2006. Expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005. After considering the effect of the litigation, the decrease from 2005 to 2006 resulted from average membership and related revenue associated with the Medicare expansion reaching the levels contemplated by the now complete build-out of infrastructure and support functions which began in the latter half of 2005, providing more leverage against administrative costs in 2006. 38 Table of Contents The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $59.0 million, or 4.8%, during 2006 compared to 2005. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio of 20.2% for 2006 increased 170 basis points from 18.5% for 2005. Expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 60 basis points for 2005. After considering the effect of the litigation, the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the percentage of small group members comprising our total fully insured membership as well as the continued shift in the mix of membership towards ASO. At December 31, 2005, 37% of our Commercial segment medical membership related to ASO business compared to 47% at December 31, 2006. Small group accounts bear a higher SG&A ratio than larger group accounts and ASO business bears a significantly higher SG&A ratio than fully insured business. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2006 totaled $148.6 million compared to $128.9 million in 2005, an increase of $19.7 million, or 15.3%. The increase resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the Medicare expansion. Interest Expense Interest expense was $63.1 million for 2006, compared to $39.3 million for 2005, an increase of $23.8 million. This increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt and higher interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2006 of 36.0% increased 9.7% compared to the 26.3% effective tax rate for 2005. The higher effective tax rate for 2006 is primarily due to the resolution of a contingent tax gain of $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year which did not recur in 2006. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. We expect the 2007 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37%. 39 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2005 and 2004 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Change 2005 2004 Dollars Percentage (dollars in thousands) Premium revenues: Medicare Advantage $ 4,590,362 $ 3,086,598 $ 1,503,764 48.7 % TRICARE 2,407,653 2,127,595 280,058 13.2 % Medicaid 548,714 511,193 37,521 7.3 % Total Government 7,546,729 5,725,386 1,821,343 31.8 % Fully insured 6,068,115 6,614,482 (546,367 ) (8.3 )% Specialty 386,747 349,564 37,183 10.6 % Total Commercial 6,454,862 6,964,046 (509,184 ) (7.3 )% Total $ 14,001,591 $ 12,689,432 $ 1,312,159 10.3 % Administrative services fees: Government $ 50,059 $ 106,764 $ (56,705 ) (53.1 )% Commercial 209,378 166,032 43,346 26.1 % Total $ 259,437 $ 272,796 $ (13,359 ) (4.9 )% Income before income taxes(a): Government $ 316,676 $ 269,063 $ 47,613 17.7 % Commercial 86,204 130,315 (44,111 ) (33.8 )% Total $ 402,880 $ 399,378 $ 3,502 0.9 % Medical expense ratios(b): Government 83.1 % 84.3 % (1.2 )% Commercial 83.3 % 83.9 % (0.6 )% Total 83.2 % 84.1 % (0.9 )% SG&A expense ratios(a)(c): Government 12.7 % 12.3 % 0.4 % Commercial 18.5 % 16.5 % 2.0 % Total 15.4 % 14.6 % 0.8 % (a) Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the expensing of stock awards under the modified retrospective application method of SFAS 123R as more fully discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Summary Net income was $296.7 million, or $1.79 per diluted common share, in 2005 compared to $269.9 million, or $1.66 per diluted common share, in 2004. The increase in net income primarily resulted from improved profits in our Government segment, driven by gains in Medicare Advantage membership and improved pretax results in both our Medicare Advantage and TRICARE operations. Net income for 2005 included expenses resulting from the class action litigation settlement ($44.8 million after taxes, or $0.27 per diluted common share) and costs associated with Hurricane Katrina ($16.9 million after taxes, or $0.10 per diluted common share). Net income for 2005 also included the favorable effect of an effective tax rate of approximately 26.3% compared to 32.4% in 2004, primarily due to the resolution of a contingent tax gain ($22.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share) during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 10.3% to $14.0 billion for 2005, compared to $12.7 billion for 2004. Higher Government segment premium revenues were partially offset by a decrease in Commercial segment premium revenues. Government segment premium revenues increased 31.8% to $7.5 billion for 2005, compared to $5.7 billion for 2004. This increase primarily was attributable to our Medicare Advantage operations and the effects of transitioning to the TRICARE South Region contract during 2004. Medicare Advantage membership was 557,800 at December 31, 2005, compared to 377,200 at December 31, 2004, an increase of 180,600 members, or 47.9%. This increase was due to expanded participation in various Medicare Advantage programs and geographic markets, as well as the CarePlus acquisition. The February 16, 2005 CarePlus acquisition added 50,400 members and $486.3 million in premium revenues in 2005. Average per member premiums for our Medicare Advantage business increased approximately 12% during 2005. This reflects a shift in our Medicare Advantage membership mix to higher reimbursement markets, due primarily to the South Florida CarePlus acquisition. TRICARE premium revenues increased 13.2% in 2005, reflecting the transition to the new South Region contract during 2004 which included a temporary loss of approximately 1 million members for 4 months in 2004. Medicaid membership declined by 20,700 members from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 41 Table of Contents primarily due to the fact that we did not renew our participation in the Medicaid program for the State of Illinois on July 31, 2005. The Illinois Medicaid business was not material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Commercial segment premium revenues decreased 7.3% to $6.5 billion for 2005, compared to $7.0 billion for 2004. Lower premium revenues primarily resulted from a reduction of fully insured membership partially offset by increases in average per member premiums. Our fully insured membership decreased 12.5%, or 286,700 members, to 1,999,800 at December 31, 2005 compared to 2,286,500 at December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily due to the relinquishment of an 89,000-member unprofitable account on January 1, 2005 and continued attrition due to the ongoing competitive environment within the fully insured group accounts, partially offset by membership gains in the individual and consumer-choice product lines. Average per member premiums for our fully insured group medical members increased approximately 7.4% in 2005. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees for 2005 were $259.4 million, a decrease of $13.4 million, or 4.9%, from $272.8 million for 2004. Administrative services fees for the Government segment decreased $56.7 million, or 53.1%, from $106.8 million for 2004 to $50.1 million for 2005. This decline resulted from the transition to the new South Region contract which carved out certain government programs including the administration of pharmacy and medical benefits to senior members over the age of 65. We transitioned services under these separate programs to other providers during 2004. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $43.4 million, or 26.1%, from $166.0 million for 2004 to $209.4 million for 2005. This increase resulted from increased membership and higher average per member fees. ASO membership of 1,171,000 members at December 31, 2005 increased 15.0% compared to 1,018,600 at December 31, 2004. Average per member fees increased approximately 8% in 2005. Investment Income Investment income totaled $143.0 million in 2005, an increase of $10.2 million from $132.8 million in 2004. This increase primarily was attributable to higher interest rates and average invested balances offset by lower capital gains. Net realized capital gains of $18.3 million in 2005 decreased $9.9 million from $28.2 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had an unrealized gain of $52.3 million related to a venture capital investment which was realized in the first quarter of 2006. Medical Expense Consolidated medical expenses increased $981.8 million or 9.2% during 2005. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation and incremental medical expenses related to the CarePlus acquisition. The consolidated MER for 2005 was 83.2%, decreasing 90 basis points from 84.1% for 2004 due to improvements in both the Commercial and Government segments as further discussed below. The 2005 consolidated MER includes 20 basis points for expenses associated with Hurricane Katrina. The Government segment medical expenses increased $1.4 billion, or 30.0% during 2005 primarily due to the increase in average per member claims costs and the increase in the number of Medicare Advantage members, including those related to the CarePlus acquisition. The increase in average per member claims costs for Medicare Advantage approximated 8% to 10% during 2005. The Government segment MER for 2005 was 83.1%, a 120 basis point decrease from the 2004 rate of 84.3%. Excluding a 10 basis point increase in the 2005 MER from Hurricane Katrina, the decrease was primarily 42 Table of Contents attributable to the increase in Medicare Advantage revenues as a percentage of total Government segment revenues and average per member Medicare Advantage premiums outpacing average per member Medicare Advantage claim costs. The Commercial segment medical expenses decreased $465.2 million, or 8.0%. This decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs. The increase in average per member claims costs for fully insured group members was approximately 7% to 9% for 2005. The MER for the Commercial segment of 83.3% in 2005 decreased 60 basis points from the 2004 MER of 83.9%. Higher medical expenses from Hurricane Katrina increased the 2005 MER 30 basis points. After considering the effect of Hurricane Katrina, the decrease in MER for the 2005 period primarily reflects the absence of the unprofitable 89,000-member large group account that lapsed on January 1, 2005. SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $301.3 million or 15.9% during 2005 primarily resulting from an increase in the number of employees due to the Medicare expansion, the class action litigation settlement, and increased advertising and marketing costs also due to the Medicare expansion. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses associated with transitioning to the TRICARE South Region contract in 2004. During 2005, the number of employees increased 5,000 to 18,700 at December 31, 2005, primarily in the sales and customer service functions associated with the growth in the Medicare business, as well as approximately 1,200 employees added with the CarePlus acquisition. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2005 was 15.4%, increasing 80 basis points from 14.6% for 2004. Expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005. After considering the effect of litigation expenses, the SG&A expense ratio increase primarily resulted from a commercial membership mix shift and increased spending associated with the Medicare expansion. Our Government and Commercial segments bear direct and indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. SG&A expenses in the Government segment increased $248.1 million, or 34.7% during 2005 due to the CarePlus acquisition, increased spending associated with the Medicare expansion, and the class action litigation settlement. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in TRICARE expenses from the transition to the South Region contract in 2004. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio increased 40 basis points from 12.3% for 2004 to 12.7% for 2005. Expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005. The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $53.2 million, or 4.5% during 2005. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 200 basis points from 16.5% for 2004 to 18.5% for 2005. Expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 60 basis points for 2005. After considering the effect of litigation expenses, this increase resulted from the continued shift in the mix of membership towards ASO. ASO business bears a significantly higher SG&A ratio than fully insured business. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2005 totaled $128.9 million compared to $117.8 million for 2004, an increase of $11.1 million, or 9.4%. Amortization of other intangible assets increased $13.3 million during 2005 primarily as a result of intangible assets recorded in connection with the CarePlus acquisition. 43 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense was $39.3 million for 2005, compared to $23.2 million for 2004, an increase of $16.1 million. This increase primarily resulted from higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2005 of 26.3% decreased 6.1% compared to the 32.4% effective tax rate in 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005 reflects the favorable impact from the resolution of a contingent tax gain of $22.8 million during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. Liquidity Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, ASO fees, CMS settlements, investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, SG&A expenses, CMS settlements, interest expense, taxes, purchases of investment securities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and payments on borrowings. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months in many instances, our business should normally produce positive cash flows during a period of increasing enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during a period of shrinking enrollment. We have recently been experiencing improving operating cash flows associated with growth in Medicare enrollment. The use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $1,740.3 million at December 31, 2006 from $732.0 million at December 31, 2005. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is summarized as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,686,712 $ 610,082 $ 344,061 Net cash used in investing activities (1,654,066 ) (767,276 ) (624,081 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 975,642 309,131 (71,305 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,008,288 $ 151,937 $ (351,325 ) Cash Flow from Operating Activities The increase in operating cash flows for 2006 resulted from Medicare enrollment growth, improved earnings, and the timing of cash flows associated with our new Medicare Part D offerings. Our Part D results related to both stand-alone PDP and MA-PD offerings reflect provisions for net amounts payable to CMS of $738.7 million under the risk corridor terms of our contracts with CMS. This risk corridor amount, which is expected to be paid mid-2007, reflects favorable experience on allowable risk corridor costs during the second half of 2006 compared to the expectations set out in our original annual bid for 2006 contracts with CMS. The favorable experience was associated with the Medicare Part D portion of our MA-PD offerings as well as our Standard and Enhanced stand-alone plans. Comparisons of our operating cash flows between 2005 and 2004 were significantly impacted by the timing of the Medicare premium remittance which is payable to us on the first day of each month. When the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, we historically received this payment at the end of the previous month. As such, the Medicare receipt for January 2004 of $211.9 million was received in December 2003 because January 1 is a holiday. 44 Table of Contents Beginning in 2005, the monthly premium payment schedule included a change in timing from previous practice. This new practice made an exception to the holiday rule for the January 1 payment. Although January 1 always represents a holiday, the new practice results in the January 1 payment being received on the first business day of January. As a result of this change, the January 2005 payment of $290.3 million originally scheduled to be received on Friday, December 31, 2004, was changed to Monday, January 3, 2005, or one business day later. Therefore, we received 12 monthly Medicare premium remittances in 2006 and 2005, compared to only 11 in 2004. In addition to the impact from the timing of the Medicare premium receipts, higher earnings and Medicare enrollment growth contributed to increased operating cash flows in 2005 and 2004. Comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and ASO fees and payments of medical expenses. We illustrate these changes with the following summary of receivables and medical and other expenses payable. The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 (in thousands) TRICARE: Base receivable $ 452,509 $ 509,444 $ 396,355 $ (56,935 ) $ 113,089 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 25,601 (25,601 ) Change orders 4,247 32,285 6,021 (28,038 ) 26,264 TRICARE subtotal 456,756 541,729 427,977 (84,973 ) 113,752 Medicare 143,875 66,536 2,287 77,339 64,249 Commercial and other 125,899 162,944 183,857 (37,045 ) (20,913 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts (45,589 ) (32,557 ) (34,506 ) (13,032 ) 1,949 Total net receivables $ 680,941 $ 738,652 $ 579,615 (57,711 ) 159,037 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Provision for doubtful accounts 20,901 4,566 Receivables from acquisition (843 ) (2,289 ) Change in receivables per cash flow statement $ (37,653 ) $ 161,314 TRICARE base receivables consist of estimated amounts owed from the federal government for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported, or IBNR, and underwriting fees. The claim reimbursement component of TRICARE base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period. The $56.9 million decrease in base receivables resulted primarily from a timing difference in our claim reimbursements partially offset by an increase in underwriting fee receivables. The increase in TRICARE base receivables from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to the transition to the reimbursement model under the South Region contract beginning on August 1, 2004 and higher claims inventories at our third party claims processing vendor. The transition to the South region contract had the effect of increasing the TRICARE base receivable and a corresponding increase in TRICARE claims payable. The $28.0 million decrease in TRICARE change order receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the collection of receivables in 2006 related to an equitable adjustment to the contract price negotiated in late 2005 for services not originally specified in the contract. 45 Table of Contents The $77.3 million increase in Medicare receivables in 2006 resulted from the growth in Medicare membership while the $64.2 million increase in 2005 was due to an increase in receivables associated with CMS risk adjustment model. The decline in Commercial and other receivables since December 31, 2004 results from the change in the mix of members from fully insured to ASO. The detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 (in thousands) IBNR(1) $ 1,678,052 $ 1,074,489 $ 879,871 $ 603,563 $ 194,618 TRICARE claims payable(2) 430,674 514,426 315,535 (83,752 ) 198,891 Reported claims in process(3) 98,033 67,065 73,883 30,968 (6,818 ) Other medical expenses payable(4) 281,502 253,702 152,721 27,800 100,981 Total medical and other expenses payable $ 2,488,261 $ 1,909,682 $ 1,422,010 578,579 487,672 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Medical and other expenses payable from acquisition (21,198 ) (37,375 ) Change in medical and other expenses payable in cash flow statement $ 557,381 $ 450,297 (1) IBNR represents an estimate of medical expenses payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) TRICARE claims payable includes all activity associated with TRICARE, including IBNR and payables for risk sharing with the federal government for cost overruns. (3) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling. (4) Other medical expenses payable includes capitation and pharmacy payables. The balance due to our pharmacy benefit administrator fluctuates due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. Medical and other expenses payable primarily increased during 2006 due growth in Medicare membership and to a lesser extent medical claims inflation. Medical and other expenses payable primarily increased during 2005 due to (1) growth in Medicare membership, (2) medical claims inflation, (3) the transition to the new South region contract, (4) an increase in the TRICARE payable resulting from an increase in claims inventory at our third party claims processing vendor as discussed under the total net receivables table on the previous page, and (5) an increase in the capitation payable to physicians under risk sharing arrangements. Cash Flow from Investing Activities We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows over the last several years in investment securities, primarily short-duration fixed income securities, totaling $862.1 million in 2006, $233.3 million in 2005, and $407.3 million in 2004. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $193.2 million 46 Table of Contents in 2006, $165.8 million in 2005, and $114.1 million in 2004. The increased spending in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from our Medicare expansion initiatives. Excluding acquisitions, we expect total capital expenditures in 2007 of approximately $200 million. During 2006, we paid $22.3 million to acquire CHA Health, net of $43.5 million of cash acquired, and we paid $5.8 million in contingent purchase price settlements related to prior years acquisitions. During 2005, we paid $352.8 million to acquire CarePlus, net of $92.1 million of cash acquired, and we paid $50.0 million to acquire Corphealth, net of $4.0 million of cash acquired. During 2004, we paid $141.8 million to acquire Ochsner, net of $15.3 million of cash acquired. During 2004, proceeds of $30.5 million from the sale of property and equipment relate primarily to consolidating our service centers in Jacksonville and San Antonio, including the sale of the Jacksonville office tower in 2004 for $14.8 million. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During 2006, we issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016. Our net proceeds, reduced for the discount and cost of the offering were $494.3 million. We used the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement, which at the time of the issuance was $200 million, and the repayment of our $300 million 7.25% senior notes which matured on August 1, 2006. During 2006, our borrowings of $550 million and repayments of $300 million under our credit agreements related to the timing of our senior notes issuance and repayment and funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2006 in conjunction with growth in Medicare revenues. During 2005, we borrowed $494 million under our 5-year $600 million credit agreement. This amount included $294 million which we borrowed temporarily to finance the CarePlus acquisition and repaid in 2005. Subsidies from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claims for which we do not assume risk were $122.3 million less than the claim payments, as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The remainder of financing activities in 2006, 2005, and 2004 resulted primarily from the change in the securities lending payable, proceeds from stock option exercises, tax benefits of stock-based compensation, and the change in the book overdraft. The increase in securities lending in 2006 coincides with a change in banking vendors and higher average balances of investments to lend. In connection with employee stock plans, we acquired common shares totaling 467,767 in 2006 and 68,296 in 2005 for an aggregate cost of $26.2 million in 2006 and $2.4 million in 2005. In 2004, we repurchased 3.6 million common shares in open market transactions and 0.2 million common shares in connection with employee stock plans for $67.0 million at an average price of $17.83 per share. The Board of Directors authorization for open market transactions expired in January 2005. Senior Notes In May 2006, we issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016 as discussed previously. We paid $300 million when our 7.25% senior notes matured on August 1, 2006. Our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Credit Agreement On July 14, 2006, we replaced our existing 5-year $600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement. We entered into the credit agreement for general corporate purposes. Under the credit agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance 47 Table of Contents basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 27 to 80 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 10 basis points, may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of the total $1 billion commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. The credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth and a maximum leverage ratio. The terms of the credit agreement also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. We have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. At this time, we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to us. At December 31, 2006, we had $450 million of borrowings under the credit agreement outstanding at an interest rate of 5.73%. In addition, we have outstanding letters of credit of $3.4 million secured under the credit agreement. No amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had $546.6 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement. We have other relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the credit agreement. Other Long-Term Borrowings Other long-term borrowings of $3.1 million at December 31, 2006 represent financing for the renovation of a building, bear interest at 2% per annum, are collateralized by the building, and are payable in various installments through 2014. Shelf Registration On March 31, 2006, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC. We are considered a well known seasoned issuer under the Securities Offering Reform Act that became effective in December 2005. The universal shelf registration allows us to sell our debt or equity securities, from time to time, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. The net proceeds from any future sales of our securities under the universal shelf registration may be used for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. Liquidity Requirements We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, to fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, and to refinance debt as it matures. Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2006 was Baa3 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s, and BBB, according to Standard & Poor Ratings Services, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moody and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a $300 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement. Assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on December 31, 48 Table of Contents 2006, we would have received $6.1 million, net, and future net interest payments would increase assuming LIBOR does not change. Other than the swap agreements, adverse changes in our credit ratings do not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the parent company increased $4.8 million to $424.4 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $419.6 million at December 31, 2005 reflecting funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2006 in conjunction with growth in Medicare revenues offset by additional borrowings in 2006. See Schedule I to this Form 10-K beginning on page 106 for our parent company only financial information. Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $2,066.0 million in our state regulated subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $1,430.3 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Given our anticipated continued premium growth in 2007, capital requirements will increase. We expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from Humana Inc., our parent company, in the range of $325 million to $425 million in 2007. Most states rely on risk-based capital requirements, or RBC, to define their required levels of equity discussed above. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entity solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. If RBC were adopted by the remaining states and Puerto Rico at December 31, 2006, each of our subsidiaries would be in substantial compliance and we would have $516.2 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under RBC, or individual state requirements. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2006 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt $ 1,253,065 $ 540 $ 1,080 $ 450,987 $ 800,458 Interest(1) 633,181 76,880 153,727 141,078 261,496 Operating leases(2) 284,879 88,196 117,191 64,124 15,368 Purchase and other obligations(3) 49,668 27,395 18,212 4,061 Total $ 2,220,793 $ 193,011 $ 290,210 $ 660,250 $ 1,077,322 (1) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements net of the effect of the associated swap agreements assuming no change in the LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2006. 49 Table of Contents (2) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease, accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases , is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased such asset, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (3) Purchase and other obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we are not involved in any SPE transactions. Guarantees and Indemnifications Our operating lease of an airplane, which expires January 1, 2010, provides for a residual value payment of no more than $4.8 million at the end of the lease term. At the end of the term, we have the right to exercise a purchase option for $8.9 million or the airplane can be sold to a third party. The residual value payment will be reduced by the net sales proceeds in excess of $4.2 million from the sale of the airplane to a third party. Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our TRICARE subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held April 26, 2007 see Certain Transactions with Management and Others. Government Contracts Our Medicare business, which accounted for approximately 55% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily consisted of products covered under the Medicare Advantage and stand-alone PDP contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies Humana of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the contract year, or Humana notifies CMS of its decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the contract year. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare business have been renewed for 2007. 50 Table of Contents Our TRICARE business, which accounted for approximately 12% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily consisted of the South Region contract. The 5-year South Region contract is subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year at the government option. Effective April 1, 2006, the South Region contract was extended into the third option period, which runs from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2007. We have received a notice from the government of its intent to renew the fourth option period. The 5-year South Region contract expires March 31, 2009. As required under the contract, the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for the third option period were negotiated. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business. These changes may include, for example, an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our Medicaid business, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida. Our Medicaid contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration accounted for approximately 2% of our total premium and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2006. We currently are operating under the terms of our contracts that expired October 31, 2006. Due to several ongoing and unresolved issues with the program, the government of Puerto Rico has decided to delay the bid process for new contracts. We currently are working with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration regarding terms and rates which is expected to result in an extension of the existing contracts through September 30, 2007. There is no assurance that the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration will request such an extension, and we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that any government policy or fiscal decisions might have on the continuation of our Medicaid contracts in Puerto Rico. The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legal Proceedings We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including employment matters, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings of Item 3 in Part 1. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents Medical Expense Recognition Medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows: December 31, 2006 Percentage of Total December 31, 2005 Percentage of Total (dollars in thousands) IBNR $ 1,996,636 80.3 % $ 1,483,902 77.7 % Reported claims in process 115,424 4.6 % 83,635 4.4 % Other medical expenses payable 376,201 15.1 % 342,145 17.9 % Total medical and other expenses payable $ 2,488,261 100.0 % $ 1,909,682 100.0 % Estimating IBNR is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results of operations and overall financial position. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a short-tail . As such, we expect that substantially all of the December 31, 2006 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2007. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim experience. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes. Completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, product mix, and weekday seasonality. The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Changes in claim processes, including receipt cycle times, inventories, recoveries of overpayments, outsourcing, system conversions, and disruptions due to weather affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors. The receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received. Increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years. For example, the average number of receipt cycle time days has decreased from 16.5 days in 2005 to 15.9 days in 2006 which represents a 3.6% reduction in cycle time. 52 Table of Contents Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, prescription drugs, and new medical technologies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services, an aging population, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2006 data: Completion Factor(a): Claims Trend Factor(b): Factor Change Increase (Decrease) in Medical and Other Expenses Payable Factor Change (Decrease) Increase in Medical and Other Expenses Payable (dollars in thousands) 1.50% $ (143,500 ) (10 %) $ (347,500 ) 1.00% $ (95,700 ) (8 %) $ (278,000 ) 0.50% $ (47,800 ) (6 %) $ (208,500 ) 0.25% $ (23,900 ) (4 %) $ (139,000 ) (0.50%) $ 47,800 (2 %) $ (69,500 ) (1.00%) $ 95,700 2 % $ 69,500 (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months. IBNR established in connection with our TRICARE contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than for our other operations, because there are more variables that impact the estimate. These additional variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries, changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions. Many of these variables are impacted by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the United States armed forces. We have considered all of these factors in establishing our IBNR estimate. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. As more fully described on page 57, our TRICARE contract contains risk-sharing provisions with the Department of Defense and with subcontractors, which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid. As a result of these contract provisions, the impact of changes in estimates for prior year TRICARE medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially, whether positive or negative. 53 Table of Contents As more fully described on pages 11 and 12, we have a significant percentage of our Medicare and Medicaid membership under risk-sharing arrangements with providers. Accordingly, the impact of changes in estimates for prior year medical claims payable on our results of operations that are attributable to our Medicare and Medicaid lines of business may also be significantly reduced, whether positive or negative. The following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our medical and other expense payable. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated medical expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Balances at January 1 $ 1,909,682 $ 1,422,010 $ 1,272,156 Acquisitions 21,198 37,375 71,063 Incurred related to: Current year 17,696,654 11,765,662 10,763,105 Prior years (275,450 ) (114,192 ) (93,458 ) Total incurred 17,421,204 11,651,470 10,669,647 Paid related to: Current year (15,532,079 ) (9,979,449 ) (9,504,331 ) Prior years (1,331,744 ) (1,221,724 ) (1,086,525 ) Total paid (16,863,823 ) (11,201,173 ) (10,590,856 ) Balances at December 31 $ 2,488,261 $ 1,909,682 $ 1,422,010 Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). As summarized in the previous table, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2005 ultimately settled during 2006 for $275.5 million less than the amounts originally estimated. During 2005, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2004 ultimately settled for $114.2 million less than the amounts originally estimated. This $161.3 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2006 as compared to 2005 consisted of $106.2 million attributable to our Medicare and commercial lines of business, as well as $55.1 million attributable to our TRICARE line of business. Amounts attributable to our TRICARE line of business are discussed separately due to the additional variability and risk sharing provisions with the Department of Defense and subcontractors. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. In our Medicare and commercial operations, both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions at December 31, 2005 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to (1) the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2005 ultimately being lower than estimated, (2) the impact of hurricanes in Florida and Louisiana in the second half of 2005 on both utilization of services and claims processing, (3) significant growth in our Medicare PFFS product, (4) reductions in receipt cycle times driven by an increase in electronic claims submissions, and (5) an increase in claim overpayment recovery levels versus our historical overpayment recovery rate. In our TRICARE line of business, both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2005 ultimately being lower than estimated, changes in claim payment patterns resulting from fluctuations in claim inventory levels, and an increase in claim overpayment recovery levels versus our historical overpayment recovery rate. During 2004, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2003 ultimately settled during 2004 for $93.5 million less than the amounts originally estimated. The $20.7 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2005 as compared to 2004 consisted of $16.3 million attributable to our TRICARE line of business and 54 Table of Contents $4.4 million attributable to our Medicare and commercial lines of business. In each of these lines of business, our trend factor assumptions at December 31, 2004 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2004 ultimately being lower than originally estimated. As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. An increase in the absolute dollar amount of redundancy over the last three years has resulted from the growth in our business, coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for medical and other expenses payable. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year contracts with commercial employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with the federal government renew annually while our Medicaid and TRICARE contracts with state and federal governments, respectively, are generally multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member. However, our Medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section. Premium revenues and ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay. Enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group, an individual, or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on available data and historical trends. We monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period revenue. We bill and collect premium and ASO fee remittances from employer groups, the federal and state governments, and individual members monthly. Premium and ASO fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Premiums and ASO fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues. Medicare Part D Provisions On January 1, 2006, we began covering prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with CMS. The payments we receive monthly from CMS and members, which are determined from our annual bid, represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract. Our CMS payment is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. In addition, we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk, as described more fully below. The risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues 55 Table of Contents related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement. The estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions, which is not expected to be applied against the rigors of a final settlement with CMS until mid-2007, requires us to consider factors that may not be certain. These factors include some first year implementation issues such as member eligibility differences with CMS, as well as interpretations of CMS operational guidance. Our estimate of the settlement associated with the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions was a net liability of $738.7 million at December 31, 2006. Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for CMS portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMS prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. We account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We do not recognize premium revenues or claims expense for these subsidies. Receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period. Gross financing receipts were $2,002.5 million and gross financing withdrawals were $2,124.7 million during 2006. CMS subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 was $450.0 million to other current assets and $327.7 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses. In order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage, CMS provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage, or coverage beyond CMS defined standard benefits. The demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which CMS pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage. The capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer. We chose the demonstration payment option for all of our enhanced benefit plans. This capitation amount, derived from our annual bid submissions, is recorded as premium revenue. The variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 6 months after the close of each calendar year. This reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. Medicare Risk Adjustment Provisions CMS has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs, as more fully described on page 5. Under this risk adjustment methodology, diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us. We collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to CMS and ultimately accepted by CMS. We do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our stand-alone PDP members. 56 Table of Contents CMS has transitioned to the risk adjustment model while the old demographic model was phased out. The demographic model based the monthly premiums paid to health plans on factors such as age, sex and disability status. The monthly premium amount for each member is separately determined under both the risk adjustment and demographic model. These separate payment amounts are then blended according to the transition schedule. CMS transitioned to the risk adjustment model for Medicare Advantage plans as follows: 30% in 2004, 50% in 2005, 75% in 2006 and 100% in 2007. The stand-alone PDP payment methodology is based 100% on the risk adjustment model. As a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment model, as well as budget neutrality as described on page 5, our CMS monthly premium payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. TRICARE Contract In 2006, TRICARE revenues represented 12% of total premiums and administrative services fees. The single TRICARE contract for the South Region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables . We allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries; (2) health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government; and (3) ASO fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, disease management and other services. We recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health care services are provided. Administrative service fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed. The TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits. Annually, we negotiate a target health care cost amount, or target cost, with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee. Any variance from the target cost is shared. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost. We receive 20% for any cost underrun, subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10% of the target cost. We pay 20% for any cost overrun, subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4% of the target cost. A final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies. We defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in medical expenses. We continually review these medical expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. The TRICARE contract contains provisions to negotiate change orders. Change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract. Under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $3,607.2 million, or 36% of total assets at December 31, 2006. Debt securities totaled $3,598.3 million, or 99% of this investment portfolio. More than 97% of our debt securities were of investment-grade quality, with an average credit rating of AA+ by S&P at December 31, 2006. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end (BB or better) of the non-investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. 57 Table of Contents Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3.3 years at December 31, 2006. Given that short term interest rates were higher than long term rates during most of 2006, cash was invested in cash equivalents instead of longer duration investment securities. Including cash equivalents, the average duration lowers to 2.2 years. Based on the duration including cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately $117 million. Our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Non-traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor. Fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately held are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies where an observable quoted market price does not exist. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders equity and comprehensive income until realized from a sale or impairment. Gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2006, included the following: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total 2006 Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses (in thousands) U.S. Government obligations $ 389,393 $ (3,073 ) $ 339,043 $ (7,255 ) $ 728,436 $ (10,328 ) Tax exempt municipal securities 533,409 (1,659 ) 501,129 (10,943 ) 1,034,538 (12,602 ) Corporate and other securities 162,169 (846 ) 167,415 (2,978 ) 329,584 (3,824 ) Mortgage-backed securities 184,394 (1,523 ) 72,449 (3,136 ) 256,843 (4,659 ) Debt securities 1,269,365 (7,101 ) 1,080,036 (24,312 ) 2,349,401 (31,413 ) Non-redeemable preferred stocks 7,959 (16 ) 7,959 (16 ) Total investment securities $ 1,277,324 $ (7,117 ) $ 1,080,036 $ (24,312 ) $ 2,357,360 $ (31,429 ) We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the issuer, factors affecting the industry the issuer operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investment fair value has been below cost, the severity of the decline, the near term prospects for recovery to cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2006 resulted from 425 positions out of a total of 758 positions held. Approximately 30% of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year. Of these investment securities in an unrealized loss position longer than a 58 Table of Contents year, approximately 97% are within 5% of recovering fair value up to cost. No single issue was below cost by more than 15%. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2006 primarily were caused by increases in interest rates. All issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities. After taking into account these and other factors, including the severity of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity, we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and, as such, no impairment was required. There were impairment losses of $0.2 million in 2006, and none in 2005 or 2004. Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2006, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 19% of total assets and 64% of total stockholders equity. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that we not amortize goodwill to earnings, but instead that we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is one level below our Commercial and Government segments. The Commercial segment two reporting units consist of medical (fully and self insured) and specialty. The Government segment three reporting units consist of Medicare, TRICARE and Medicaid. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. Outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital. Key assumptions, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. There were no impairment losses in 2006 or 2005. We recognized losses due to accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of $9.3 million in 2004.
