Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General . Grainger distributes facilities maintenance products and provides related services and information used by businesses and institutions primarily in the United States, Canada, Japan and Mexico to keep their facilities and equipment running. Grainger has two reportable segments: the United States and Canada. Grainger integrated the Lab Safety Supply business into the Grainger Industrial Supply business in 2009 and results are now reported under the United States segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands Grainger Inc. Other businesses include the following: MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (Japan), Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Grainger Industrial Supply India Private Limited (India), Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico), Grainger China LLC (China) and Grainger Panama S.A. (Panama). Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, direct marketing materials and catalogs. Grainger serves approximately 2.0 million customers through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers and multiple Web sites. Business Environment . Several economic factors and industry trends shape Grainger business environment and projections for the coming year. Historically, Grainger sales trends have tended to correlate positively with industrial production and non-farm payrolls. In February 2010, Consensus Forecast-USA reported a 2009 decline of 9.7% and 2.4% for Industrial Production and GDP, respectively. According to the Federal Reserve, non-farm payrolls decreased 3.1% from December 2008 to December 2009. The continued decline in the economy affected Grainger sales growth for 2009, which declined 9 percent. In February 2010, Consensus Forecast-USA projected 2010 GDP growth of 3.1% and Industrial Production growth of 4.9% for the United States. In February 2010, Consensus Forecast-USA projected GDP growth of 2.7% for Canada, as compared with a 2.5% estimated decline in 2009. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 24% of Grainger total 2009 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States declined approximately 9.9% from December 2008 to December 2009, while manufacturing output decreased 1.3% from December 2008 to December 2009. This decline in manufacturing employment and output contributed to a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a high single-digit decline in the light manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2009. Outlook . While in early 2010 there are some initial signs of improvement in the overall economy, job growth is expected to lag the economic recovery. Grainger expects positive sales growth in 2010 of 6 to 10 percent which will be realized through the impact of acquisitions made in 2009, favorable foreign exchange rates and organic growth. Beginning in 2006, Grainger has added approximately 234,000 new products as part of its multiyear product line expansion program in the United States, of which 70,000 were added to the 2010 catalog, issued in February. Products were added to supplement the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines. The product line expansion program has been a positive contributor to sales since being launched, and is expected to continue to be a driver of growth in 2010 and beyond. Grainger plans to continue to invest in the business and may choose to fund some additional sales and marketing programs to increase market share if sales trends accelerate in 2010. Operating expenses are expected to increase in 2010 compared to 2009, due in part to incremental expenses from the businesses acquired in 2009. In addition, part of the expenses eliminated in 2009 as a result of lowering the cost structure will return, such as merit increases and incentive compensation. Grainger expects some reduction in operating expenses in 2010 from changes in its paid time off program, partially offsetting these increases. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $150 million to $175 million in 2010. Projected investments include continued investments in distribution centers, information technology, and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects to fund 2010 capital investments from operating cash flows. Matters Affecting Comparability . There were 255 sales days in 2009 and 2007, compared to 256 sales days in 2008. Grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2008 and 2009, all of which were immaterial individually, and in the aggregate. Grainger operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition date. Effective January 1, 2009, Grainger revised its segment disclosure. Prior year amounts have been restated in a consistent manner. 11 Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (9.2 )% 6.7 % Cost of merchandise sold 58.2 59.0 59.4 (10.4 ) 6.0 Gross profit 41.8 41.0 40.6 (7.5 ) 7.9 Operating expenses 31.1 29.6 30.1 (4.6 ) 4.8 Operating earnings 10.7 11.4 10.5 (15.0 ) 16.7 Other income (expense) 0.7 (0.1 ) 0.2 (545.5 ) (184.3 ) Income taxes 4.5 4.4 4.1 (7.2 ) 13.8 Noncontrolling interest 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net earnings attributable to W.W. Grainger, Inc. 6.9 % 6.9 % 6.6 % (9.4 )% 13.1 % 2009 Compared to 2008 Grainger net sales of $6,222.0 million for 2009 decreased 9.2% when compared with net sales of $6,850.0 million for 2008. There was one less selling day in 2009 versus 2008. Daily sales were down 8.8%. Sales were negatively affected by a decline in volume of approximately 14 percentage points, partially offset by price increases of approximately 5 percentage points. In addition, sales were negatively affected by 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange, while sales from acquisitions contributed approximately 1 percentage point. The overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector, followed by a low 20 percent decline in the reseller customer sector and a mid-teen percent decline in the contractor customer sector. The government customer sector performed the strongest as sales were flat for 2009, followed by a mid single-digit decline in the commercial customer sector. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $2,598.5 million for 2009 decreased 7.5%. The gross profit margin for 2009 increased 0.8 percentage point to 41.8% from 41.0% in 2008. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the mix of sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins. Operating expenses of $1,933.3 million for 2009 decreased 4.6% from $2,025.6 million for 2008. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of lower headcount, profit sharing and incentive compensation. Non-payroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts. Operating earnings of $665.2 million for 2009 decreased 15.0% from $782.7 million for 2008. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to the decline in sales combined with operating expenses, which declined at a lower rate than sales. These declines were partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. Net earnings for 2009 decreased by 9.4% to $430.5 million from $475.4 million in 2008. The decline in net earnings for 2009 primarily resulted from the decline in operating earnings, partially offset by the one-time noncash pre-tax gain of $47.4 million ($28 million after tax) from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner in September 2009. Diluted earnings per share of $5.62 in 2009 were 5.9% lower than $5.97 for 2008, primarily due to the decline in net earnings, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. In the first quarter of 2009, Grainger adopted authoritative guidance regarding Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities, resulting in a seven cent reduction to the previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment and business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $5,445.4 million for 2009, a decrease of $612.4 million, or 10.1%, when compared with net sales of $6,057.8 million for 2008. Daily sales in the United States were down 9.8%. All customer sectors were negatively impacted by economic conditions. The overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and in the reseller customer sector. The contractor and light manufacturing customer sectors declined in the mid-teens and high single digits, respectively, while the government customer sector 12 performed the strongest with flat sales for 2009. Due to the impact of acquisitions made in 2009, favorable foreign exchange rates and organic growth, sales are expected to improve in 2010. Beginning in 2006, Grainger has added approximately 234,000 new products to supplement the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of the business ongoing product line expansion initiative. The most recent catalog, issued in February 2010, offers a total of 307,000 products, an increase of 70,000 products over the 2009 catalog. The segment gross profit margin increased 1.3 percentage points in 2009 over 2008. The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers. Operating expenses in this segment were down 4.6% for 2009. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of reduced headcount, lower profit sharing and no incentive compensation, partially offset by an increase in severance costs. Non-payroll related expenses also decreased due to cost containment efforts. For the segment, operating earnings of $735.6 million for 2009 decreased 12.5% over $840.4 million for 2008. This decrease in operating earnings for 2009 was primarily due to the decline in net sales and operating expenses which declined at a lower rate than sales, partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. Canada Net sales were $651.2 million for 2009, a decrease of $76.8 million, or 10.6%, when compared with $728.0 million for 2008. Daily sales were down 10.2% and in local currency, daily sales decreased 3.9% for 2009. The decrease in net sales was led by declines in the heavy manufacturing and contractor customer sectors driven by economic conditions. Partially offsetting these declines were strong sales to the utilities customer sector driven by special projects, and to higher sales to the government. The gross profit margin decreased 1.1 percentage points in 2009 over 2008. The decline in the gross profit margin was primarily due to cost increases exceeding price increases and an increase in the mix of lower margin sales, particularly to large customers. Operating expenses decreased 11.5% in 2009. In local currency, operating expenses decreased 5.6% primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation accruals, and non-payroll related expenses including lower travel and advertising costs. In addition, 2008 included expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services. Operating earnings of $43.7 million for 2009 were down $10.5 million, or 19.4% for 2009. In local currency, operating earnings decreased 15.6% primarily due to the decline in net sales and gross profit margin. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China and Panama, were up 47.7% for 2009. Daily sales increased 48.3%. The increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of results from the acquisitions of the businesses in India and Japan, along with a positive contribution from China. Operating losses for other businesses were $11.6 million for 2009, a 1.6% improvement compared to operating losses of $11.8 million for 2008. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $42.1 million of income in 2009, an increase of $51.6 million as compared with $9.5 million of expense in 2008. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ (7,408 ) $ (9,416 ) Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 1,497 3,642 Gain (write-off) of investment in unconsolidated entities 47,343 (6,031 ) Other non-operating income 964 2,668 Other non-operating expense (283 ) (317 ) $ 42,113 $ (9,454 ) The change from net expense to net income was primarily attributable to the one-time noncash gain of $47.4 million from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner in September 2009. In addition, 2008 included the write-off of a joint venture investment in India as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating income is lower primarily due to lower foreign currency transactions gains versus 2008. 13 Income Taxes Income taxes of $276.6 million in 2009 decreased 7.2% as compared with $297.9 million in 2008. Grainger effective tax rates were 39.1% and 38.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the tax rate in 2009 was primarily driven by increased U.S. state tax rates. For 2010, Grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 39.3%. The increase is primarily due to current estimates of the U.S. state tax rates and unfavorable impacts of non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. 2008 Compared to 2007 Grainger net sales of $6,850.0 million for 2008 increased 6.7% when compared with net sales of $6,418.0 million for 2007. There was one more selling day in 2008 versus 2007. Daily sales were up 6.3%. The increase in net sales was led by high single-digit sales growth in the government sector, and mid single-digit sales growth in the commercial and reseller sectors. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sales growth came from Grainger product line expansion initiative and approximately 5 percentage points came from price and volume. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further detail of Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives. The gross profit margin for 2008 improved 0.4 percentage point to 41.0% from 40.6% in 2007. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases exceeding cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the mix of sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins. Operating earnings of $782.7 million for 2008 increased 16.7% over the $670.7 million for 2007. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and positive operating expense leverage. Net earnings for 2008 increased by 13.1% to $475.4 million from $420.1 million in 2007. The growth in net earnings for 2008 primarily resulted from the improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by lower interest income, higher interest expense and the write-off of Grainger $6.0 million investment in Grainger Industrial Supply India Private Limited, formerly known as Asia Pacific Brands India Private Limited. Diluted earnings per share of $5.97 in 2008 were 21.6% higher than the $4.91 for 2007. This improvement was higher than the percentage increase for net earnings due to the effect of Grainger share repurchase program. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment and business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. United States Net sales were $6,057.8 million for 2008, an increase of $328.5 million, or 5.7%, when compared with net sales of $5,729.3 million for 2007. Daily sales were up 5.3%. Sales were led by high single-digit sales growth in the government sector, and mid single-digit sales growth in the commercial and reseller sectors. Approximately 2 percentage points of the sales growth came from the product line expansion initiative and approximately 4 percentage points came from price and volume. Sales volume was negatively affected by approximately 1 percentage point due to a decline in sales of seasonal products. In 2004, a multiyear market expansion program was launched to strengthen Grainger presence in top metropolitan markets and better position it to serve local customers. The market expansion program was completed in 2008, however, the benefits realized from this initiative are expected to continue. Consistent with the overall downturn in the economy, beginning in October most of these markets saw negative sales growth, which significantly affected sales growth for 2008. Results for the market expansion program were as follows: Daily Sales Increase 2008 vs. 2007 Phase 1 (Atlanta, Denver, Seattle) 7% Phase 2 (Four markets in Southern California) 5% Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, Tampa) 10% Phase 4 (Baltimore, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.) 2% Phase 5 (Dallas, Detroit, New York, Phoenix) 3% Phase 6 (Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco) 6% Over the past three years, over 150,000 new products have been added to supplement the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of the business ongoing product line expansion initiative. The catalog, issued in 2009, offered a total of 237,000 products, an increase of 50,000 products over the 2008 catalog. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2008 over 2007, driven primarily by price increases exceeding cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers. 14 Operating expenses in this segment were up 3.3% in 2008. Expenses grew at a slower rate than sales primarily due to lower advertising expenses, incentive compensation, severance and lower bad debt expense, the result of improved collection efficiency. For the segment, operating earnings of $840.4 million for 2008 increased 14.9% over the $731.6 million for 2007. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and positive operating expense leverage. Canada Net sales were $728.0 million for 2008, an increase of $91.5 million, or 14.4%, when compared with $636.5 million for 2007. Daily sales were up 13.9%. In local currency, daily sales increased 13.1%. The increase was led by sales growth in the contractor, agriculture and mining and government sectors. Macro economic factors such as higher commodity prices for oil, gas and mineral products drove a significant portion of this growth due to an increase in customer demand in these sectors. Sales to new customers and increased sales penetration to existing customers was also a contributing factor to these increases. The gross profit margin increased 0.3 percentage points in 2008 over 2007. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to price increases exceeding cost increases. Operating expenses were up 13.7% in 2008. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to payroll and benefits as a result of increased headcount, merit increases and commissions, and higher advertising and occupancy expenses, and expenses related to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services. Operating earnings of $54.3 million for 2008 were up $10.0 million, or 22.7%. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than sales. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include Mexico, Puerto Rico, China and Panama, were up 19.5% for 2008. Daily sales increased 19.0%. The increase in net sales was due primarily to Mexico as sales increased 11.9% in 2008 versus 2007. Daily sales were up 11.5%. In local currency, daily sales were up 12.7%, driven primarily by increased market share coming from the ongoing branch expansion program. Operating losses for other businesses were $11.8 million for 2008, a 57.8% increase over operating losses of $7.5 million for 2007. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $9.5 million of expense in 2008, compared with $11.2 million of income in 2007. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ (9,416 ) $ 9,151 Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 3,642 2,016 Write-off of investment in unconsolidated entity (6,031 ) Other non-operating income 2,668 404 Other non-operating expense (317 ) (363 ) $ (9,454 ) $ 11,208 The change from net interest income to net interest expense was primarily attributable to the four-year bank term loan obtained in May 2008. The write-off of the investment relates to Grainger Industrial Supply India Private Limited, formerly known as Asia Pacific Brands India Private Limited as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other non-operating income increased primarily due to higher foreign exchange transaction gains. Income Taxes Income taxes of $297.9 million in 2008 increased 13.8% as compared with $261.7 million in 2007. Grainger effective tax rates were 38.5% and 38.4% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 15 Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as pay cash dividends. Cash Flow Net cash flows from operations of $732.4 million in 2009, $530.1 million in 2008 and $468.9 million in 2007 continued to improve Grainger financial position and serve as the primary source of funding. Contributing to cash flows from operations were net earnings for 2009 of $430.8 million and the effect of noncash expenses such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, partially offset by the noncash pre-tax gain of $47.3 million from unconsolidated entities after Grainger became a majority owner. Also contributing to net cash provided by operating activities were changes in operating assets and liabilities, which resulted in a net source of cash of $121.8 million for 2009. The principal operating source of cash was a decrease in inventory due to lower purchases. Other current liabilities declined primarily due to reduced profit sharing and incentive compensation accruals. Net cash provided by operations increased $61.2 million in 2008 over 2007, driven primarily by increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions reduced cash by $143.1 million in 2008. This use of cash was driven primarily by an increase in inventory due to the product line expansion initiative. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $262.6 million, $202.6 million and $197.0 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software was $142.4 million, $195.0 million and $197.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. In 2009, Grainger funded infrastructure improvement projects in the distribution centers in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and paid $121.8 million for business acquisitions and other investments, net of cash received. In 2008, Grainger continued to fund the Company market expansion initiative. Net cash flows used in financing activities for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $413.5 million, $36.8 million and $513.9 million, respectively. Proceeds from the four-year bank term loan of $500 million were included in 2008. Treasury stock purchases were $372.7 million in 2009 as Grainger repurchased 4.5 million shares compared to purchases of $394.2 million in 2008 to repurchase 5.5 million shares. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock remained available under Grainger repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $134.7 million in 2009 versus $121.5 million in 2008. Grainger also used cash in financing activities to repay $18.9 million of long-term debt borrowings in 2009 and $81.4 million to repay short-term borrowings in 2008. In 2007, treasury stock purchases were $647.3 million for 7.2 million shares and dividends paid to shareholders were $113.1 million. Working Capital Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and of funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital was $1,354.7 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $1,382.4 million at December 31, 2008 and $974.4 million at December 31, 2007. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.7, 2.8 and 2.2. Working capital and the current ratio were essentially flat in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in the current ratio and working capital from 2007 to 2008 primarily related to increases in cash and inventories and the replacement of short-term borrowings with long-term borrowings. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 67,917 $ 107,688 $ 100,380 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 63,667 76,163 87,389 Subtotal 131,584 183,851 187,769 Capitalized software 8,367 12,297 8,556 Total $ 139,951 $ 196,148 $ 196,325 In 2009, significant capital expenditures included investments in the United States distribution center network. In addition, there was continued investment in Canada and other international branches and distribution centers, as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment. 16 In 2008, Grainger substantially completed its investments in the market expansion program in the United States which realigned branches in the top 25 major metropolitan areas. In addition, there was continued international investment, including branch expansion in Mexico, as well as the normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2007, Grainger investments included the market expansion program, Mexico and China expansion and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $150 million to $175 million in 2010. Projected investments include continued investments in distribution centers, information technology, and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects to fund 2010 capital investments from operating cash flows. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. A four-year bank term loan of $500 million was obtained in May 2008. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2009, Grainger long-term debt rating by Standard & Poor was AA+. Grainger available lines of credit, as further discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were $250.0 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 19.1%, 20.7% and 5.0% as of the same dates. The increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization in 2008 was primarily the result of the $500 million bank term loan. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2009, Grainger contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars): Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years Long-term debt obligations $ 490,628 $ 53,128 $ 437,500 $ $ Interest on long-term debt 10,214 4,668 5,453 93 Operating lease obligations 216,924 42,832 69,741 52,900 51,451 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 42,025 24,215 17,810 Commitments to purchase inventory 212,700 212,694 6 Other purchase obligations 135,694 64,836 35,659 31,146 4,053 Other liabilities 191,346 10,726 17,264 20,343 143,013 Total $ 1,299,531 $ 413,099 $ 583,433 $ 104,482 $ 198,517 Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections. Other employment-related benefits costs of $39.1 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 9 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of $27.9 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2009. This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. 17 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Write-offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends. Inventory Reserves . Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates, affecting Grainger inventory values and cost of merchandise sold. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on Grainger results of operations. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets . Grainger business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment write-downs that Grainger may incur in future periods. Grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger determines fair value using an income approach, in conjunction with relevant market information which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability of acquired businesses. Grainger believes that it does not have a material amount of goodwill at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test; however, due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and market conditions, impairment charges could occur in future periods. Stock Incentive Plans . Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 used the following assumptions: For the years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Risk-free interest rate 2.4 % 3.2 % 4.6 % Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 28.8 % 25.2 % 24.3 % Expected dividend yield 2.3 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 18 The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employee related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. As of December 31, 2009, Grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 5.9% to 6.0% to reflect the increase in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that this increase in the discount rate will increase 2010 pretax earnings by approximately $0.6 million, although other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor 500 Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2009, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2009 results (in thousands of dollars): 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 5,278 $ (4,100 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 44,290 (34,925 ) In 2009, Grainger changed the mortality table used in the postretirement valuation from RP2000 to the IRS 2008 Fully Generational Mortality Table which builds in future increases in healthcare rates and expenses due to improved mortality rates. This change resulted in a $13.9 million increase of the postretirement healthcare obligation as of December 31, 2009, and is estimated to decrease 2010 pretax earnings by approximately $2.5 million. Other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. 19 Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and, therefore, may affect Grainger retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves . Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period results of operations. Income Taxes . Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Other. Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 New Accounting Standards The following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on Grainger upon adoption. In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding employer disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets, codified primarily in ASC 715. ASC 715 requires expanded disclosures about investment policies and strategies for the plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan, including information regarding major categories of assets, input and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within the plans. The Company has applied the provision of ASC 715 and the adoption did not have a material effect on the Company results of operations or financial position. In June 2009, the FASB issued The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, codified in ASC 105, which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to be applied by non-governmental entities. The Accounting Standards Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. ASC 105 was effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company has applied this statement and the adoption did not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position. Inflation Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. Some of Grainger products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper or oil, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumption, assumptions, believe, believes, continue, continued, continues, continues to believe it complies, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expectation, expected, expects, forecast, forecasts, had potentially, intended, intends, likely, may, might, plans, predict, predictable, presumption, project, projected, projecting, projection, projections, potential, reasonably likely, scheduled, should, tended, timing and outcome are uncertain, unanticipated, unlikely, will, will be realized, and would or similar expressions. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause Grainger results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 21
