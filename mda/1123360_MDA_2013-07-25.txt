ITEM 7- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this report. See also Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements located above Item 1 - Business. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6 - Selected Financial Data and Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data appearing elsewhere in this annual report. General We are a provider of electronic payments transaction processing services for consumers, merchants, independent sales organizations (ISOs), financial institutions, government agencies and multi-national corporations located throughout the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Republic of Malta, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation and the Asia-Pacific region. We serve as an intermediary to facilitate payment transactions and operate in two business segments, North America merchant services and International merchant services. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000 and spun-off from our former parent company on January 31, 2001. Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payments business since 1967. Our North America merchant services and International merchant services segments target customers in many vertical industries including financial institutions, gaming, government, health care, professional services, restaurants, retail, universities, nonprofit organizations and utilities. Our offerings provide merchants, ISOs and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing and check-related services. Our primary business model provides payment products and services directly to merchants as our end customers. We also provide similar products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of ISOs that, in turn, resell our products and services, in which case, the financial institutions and select ISOs are our end customers. These particular services are marketed in the United States, Canada, and parts of Eastern Europe. The majority of merchant services revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type. We also charge other fees based on specific services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Revenue from credit cards and signature debit cards is generally based on a percentage of transaction value along with other related fees, while revenue from PIN debit cards is typically based on a fee per transaction. Our products and services are marketed through a variety of sales channels that include a dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, retail outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions. We seek to leverage the continued shift to electronic payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value. We also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and Latin America. Our business does not have pronounced seasonality in which more than 30% of our revenues occur in one quarter. However, each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the portfolio. While there is some variation in seasonality across markets, the first and fourth quarters are generally the strongest, and the third quarter tends to be the weakest due to lower volumes processed in the months of January and February. Executive Overview 26 Table of Contents In fiscal 2013, revenues increased 7.8% to $2,375.9 million from $2,203.8 million in fiscal 2012. This revenue growth was primarily due to growth driven by our U.S. ISO channel, growth from our direct sales channels and gaming business, and growth in Europe; partially offset by market-based pricing compression in Canada. Consolidated operating income was $357.2 million for fiscal 2013 , compared to $307.3 million for fiscal 2012 . Consolidated operating income for fiscal 2013 and 2012 includes processing system intrusion costs of $36.8 million and $84.4 million , respectively. Net income attributable to Global Payments increased $27.9 million, or 14.8%, to $216.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $188.2 million in the prior year, resulting in a $0.39 increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.76 in fiscal 2013 from $2.37 in fiscal 2012 . North America merchant services segment revenue increased $138.4 million , or 8.8% , to $1,705.7 million in fiscal 2013 from $1,567.3 million in fiscal 2012 . North America merchant services segment operating income decreased to $258.9 million in fiscal 2013 from $281.3 million in fiscal 2012 , with operating margins of 15.2% and 17.9% for fiscal 2013 and 2012 , respectively. International merchant services segment revenue increased $33.6 million, or 5.3% , to $670.2 million in fiscal 2013 from $636.6 million in fiscal 2012 . International merchant services operating income also increased to $211.2 million in fiscal 2013 from $196.1 million in fiscal 2012 , with operating margins of 31.5% and 30.8% for fiscal 2013 and 2012 , respectively. During fiscal 2013, we completed three acquisitions which expanded our distribution capabilities in the United States, Asia and Spain. In October 2012, we acquired Accelerated Payment Technologies ("APT"), a U.S. provider of integrated payment technology solutions for small and medium sized merchants for a purchase price of $413.0 million , less working capital. In December 2012, we completed the purchase of HSBC Asia's ("HSBC") 44% interest in Global Payments Asia-Pacific Limited ("GPAP") for $242.0 million . Also in December 2012, Comercia Global Payments Entidad de Pago, S.L. ("Comercia"), based in Spain, completed the acquisition of the merchant acquiring business of Banca Civica, S.A. ("Civica") from CaixaBank, S.A. ("CaixaBank") for 17.5 million ( $22.9 million equivalent as of the acquisition date). In early March 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system. Our investigation also revealed potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from merchants who applied for processing services. The merchants who could potentially be affected are limited to those based in the U.S. We cannot verify those potentially affected as it is unclear whether any information was exported; however, we notified potentially-affected individuals and made available credit monitoring and identity protection insurance at no cost to the individuals. As a result of this event, certain card networks removed us from their list of PCI DSS compliant service providers. Our work to remediate our systems and processes is complete. We hired a Qualified Security Assessor, or QSA, to conduct an independent review of the PCI DSS compliance of our systems. Global Payments Direct, Inc., our primary operating entity, has been returned to the list of PCI DSS compliant service providers and we have received reports on compliance covering all of our systems that process, store, transmit or oth erwise utilize card data. To date, we have not experienced a material loss of revenue that we can confirm has been related to this event. However, this event and our related remediation efforts could potentially have a negative impact on future revenues. For year ended May 31, 2013, we recorded $36.8 million of expense associated with this incident, bringing our life-to-date expense to $121.2 million. Of this life to date expense amount, $105.5 million represents costs incurred through May 31, 2013 for professional fees and other costs associated with the investigation and remediation, incentive payments to certain business partners and costs associated with credit monitoring and identity protection insurance. An additi onal $35.7 million represents total fraud losses, fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. We also recorded $20.0 million of insurance recoveries. During fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by $31.8 million. We based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. We have now reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. The primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2013 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2012 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012 , this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2012 .

Processing System Intrusion In early March 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system. Our investigation also revealed potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from merchants who applied for processing services. The merchants who could potentially be affected are limited to those based in the U.S. We cannot verify those potentially affected as it is unclear whether any information was exported; however, we notified potentially-affected individuals and made available credit monitoring and identity protection insurance at no cost to the individuals. 28 Table of Contents As a result of this event, certain card networks removed us from their list of PCI DSS compliant service providers. Our work to remediate our systems and processes is complete. We hired a Qualified Security Assessor, or QSA, to conduct an independent review of the PCI DSS compliance of our systems. Our QSA completed the evaluation of our remediation work. Global Payments Direct, Inc, our primary operating entity, has been returned to the list of PCI DSS compliant service providers and we have received reports on compliance covering all of our systems that process, store, transmit or otherwise utilize card data. To date, we have not experienced a material loss of revenue that we can confirm has been related to this event. However, this event and our related remediation efforts could potentially have a negative impact on future revenues. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 , we recorded $36.8 million of expense associated with this incident, bringing the life-to-date total expense to $121.2 million . Of this life-to-date expense, $105.5 million represents costs incurred through May 31, 2013 for professional fees and other costs associated with the investigation and remediation, incentive payments to certain business partners and costs associated with credit monitoring and identity protection insurance. An additional $35.7 million represents total fraud losses, fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. We also recorded $20.0 million of insurance recoveries as discussed below. During fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by $31.8 million . We based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. We have now reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. The primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected. A class action arising out of the processing system intrusion was filed against us on April 4, 2012 by Natalie Willingham (individually and on behalf of a putative nationwide class) (the "Plaintiff"). Specifically, Ms. Willingham alleged that we failed to maintain reasonable and adequate procedures to protect her personally identifiable information ( PII ) which she claims resulted in two fraudulent charges on her credit card in March 2012. Further, Ms. Willingham asserted that we failed to timely notify the public of the data breach. Based on these allegations, Ms. Willingham asserted claims for negligence, violation of the Federal Stored Communications Act, willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, negligent violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, violation of Georgia's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, negligence per se, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, and breach of implied contract. Ms. Willingham sought an unspecified amount of damages and injunctive relief. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. On May 14, 2012, we filed a motion to dismiss. On July 11, 2012, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend her complaint, and on July 16, 2012, the Court granted that motion. She then filed an amended complaint on July 16, 2012. The amended complaint did not add any new causes of action. Instead, it added two new named Plaintiffs (Nadine and Robert Hielscher) (together with Plaintiff, the "Plaintiffs") and dropped Plaintiff's claim for negligence per se. On August 16, 2012, we filed a motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' amended complaint. The Plaintiffs' filed their response in opposition to our motion to dismiss on October 5, 2012, and we subsequently filed our reply brief on October 22, 2012. The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending dismissal of all of Plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. The Plaintiffs subsequently agreed to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice, with each party bearing its own fees and costs. This was the only consideration exchanged by the parties in connection with Plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuit. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on March 6, 2013. This event could result in additional lawsuits in the future. In addition, governmental entities have made inquiries and the Federal Trade Commission has initiated an investigation related to the event. We have not recorded any loss accruals related to these items or any other claims (except as described above) that have been or may be asserted against us in relation to this incident as we have not determined that losses associated with any such claims or potential claims are probable. Further, we do not have sufficient information to estimate the amount or range of possible losses associated with such matters. As more information becomes available, if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such probable loss that we will incur on that claim is reasonably estimable, we will accrue our estimate of such loss. If and when we record such an accrual, it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. We were insured under policies that we believe may provide coverage of certain costs associated with this event. The policies provided a total of $30.0 million in policy limits and contain various sub-limits of liability and other terms, conditions and limitations, including a $1.0 million deductible per claim. As of May 31, 2013 , we have received $20.0 million in insurance recoveries. We will record receivables for any additional recoveries in the periods in which we determine such recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Revenues 29 Table of Contents We derive our revenues from four primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, service fees and equipment sales and rentals. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions. For fiscal 2013 , revenues increased 7.8% to $2,375.9 million compared to the prior year. This growth is primarily due to growth driven by our U.S. ISO channel, growth from our direct sales channels and gaming business, and growth in Europe; partially offset by market-based pricing compression in Canada. Our revenues have been affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended May 31, 2013, currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by $20.3 million compared to the prior year. To calculate this we converted our fiscal 2013 actual revenues at fiscal 2012 rates. North America Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2013 , revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 8.8% compared to the prior year to $1,705.7 million . North America revenue growth was driven by our U.S. ISO channel, strong growth from our direct sales channels, gaming business and reduced interchange expense due to legislation. We grow our United States revenue primarily by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, largely through our ISO channel. For fiscal 2013 , our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 11.2% compared to the prior year. Increased spreads have offset the impact of lower average ticket, which decreased by 0.9% in fiscal 2013 . This decline in average ticket is primarily due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants. For fiscal 2013 , our Canadian revenue decreased 6.4% to $311.0 million while our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 3.2% compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenue was due to ongoing market-based pricing compression. International Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2013 , International merchant services revenue increased 5.3% to $670.2 million compared to the prior year. Our Europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2013 increased 6.8% to $522.6 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by strong transaction growth in all markets. Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue of $147.7 million was flat for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year resulting from a slight decrease of 0.8% in the number of credit and debit card processed transactions. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessments and other fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services; network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 9.9% during fiscal 2013 , compared to the prior year primarily driven by revenue growth. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 36.3% for fiscal year 2013 from 35.6% in the prior year. Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management; commissions paid to ISOs, independent contractors, and other third parties; advertising costs; other selling expenses; share-based compensation expense and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 9.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. In addition, as a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 47.1% for fiscal 2013 from 46.6% in the prior year. These increases are primarily due to an increase in commission payments to ISOs and costs associated with our start up operations in Brazil. These increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of ISO commission payments previously made to APT as a result of our acquisition of APT on October 1, 2012. 30 Table of Contents Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment decreased 8.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to market-based pricing compression in Canada. The operating margin was 15.2% and 17.9% for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by the ISO channel, including the impact of the Durbin amendment, Canadian spread compression and costs associated with our start up operation in Brazil. These increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of ISO commission payments previously made to APT as a result of our acquisition of APT on October 1, 2012. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. Effective October 1, 2011, the new debit interchange legislation capped the amount of interchange that card issuers may charge on transactions. Our interchange expenses decreased as a result of this. We recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased as a result of lower interchange expense with a resulting increase in operating income as well. Increased revenues came primarily through our ISO channel, where reduced interchange fees led to higher revenues and a dollar-for-dollar increase in ISO commission expense, with an associated reduction in our operating margin. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 7.7% to $211.2 million for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 31.5% and 30.8% for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The increase in operating margin in our International merchant services segment is due to strong results in Europe, partially offset by last year's marketing fee true-up in Spain, whereby CaixaBank compensated us for favorable pricing to certain CaixaBank customers during the initial phase of our marketing alliance agreement. Corporate Our corporate expenses include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, expenses related to our Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines that have not been allocated to our business segments, insurance, employee incentive programs, share-based compensation programs, and certain corporate staff, including finance, accounting, information technology, including data security, legal, human resources, marketing and executive. We also consider costs associated with the processing system intrusion to be a corporate expense. Our corporate costs decreased 33.6% to $112.9 million for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion and charges related to two contractual disputes in fiscal 2012. Consolidated Operating Income During the fiscal year 2013 , our consolidated operating income increased $49.9 million to $357.2 million from $307.3 million in the prior year. The increase in our consolidated operating income is primarily due to solid financial results in North America and Europe and lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion in fiscal compared to 2012. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other expense, net, increased to $22.9 million for fiscal 2013 compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period. The increase is due to higher debt balances as well as an $8.4 million distribution to HSBC in fiscal 2013. This distribution was characterized as interest expense in accordance with the provision of ASC 480. For further details, see Note 4 - Business and Intangible Asset Acquisitions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were 28.6% and 27.6% for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended May 31, 2013 and 2012 reflect adjustments to our U.K. deferred tax asset due to legislated enacted corporate tax rate reductions in the United Kingdom of 2% in each year. Our effective tax rates differ from U.S. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion. Noncontrolling Interests, Net of Tax Noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased to $22.6 million from $29.4 million for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , respectively. This decrease is primarily due to the fact that we stopped attributing income to the GPAP redeemable noncontrolling interest subsequent to July 26, 2012 , the date of our agreement to purchase HSBC's interest. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2011 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2011. Comercia's results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations and results of operations of our International merchant services segment from December 20, 2010, the date we acquired our controlling financial interest. Accordingly, results of operations for the year ended May 31, 2011 reflect the results of Comercia's operations for five months, while results of operations for the year ended May 31, 2012 reflect a full year of operating results.

Processing System Intrusion In early March of 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our North America card processing system. During fiscal 2012, we recorded $84.4 million of expense associated with this event. For further details, see Note 2 - Processing System Intrusion in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Revenues 33 Table of Contents We derive our revenues from four primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, service fees and equipment sales and rentals. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions. For fiscal 2012 , revenues increased 18.5% to $2,203.8 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to strong performance across most of our regions, and the impact of our acquisition of a 51.0% controlling financial interest in Comercia on December 20, 2010. North America Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2012 , revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 15.0% compared to the prior year to $1,567.3 million . The North America merchant services segment revenue growth was driven by our U.S. ISO channel, reduced interchange expense as explained below, strong growth from our gaming business and solid performance from our direct sales channel. We grow our United States revenue by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISO channel. For fiscal 2012 , our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 13.1% compared to the prior year. Increased spreads, primarily driven by lower interchange expense due to the Durbin amendment, have offset the impact of lower average ticket, which decreased by 3.2% in fiscal 2012 . This decline in average ticket is primarily due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants. Based on our mix of merchants, slightly more than half of our United States transactions are comprised of a combination of signature- and PIN-based debit transactions, with PIN-based debit transactions representing less than 10.0% of our total transactions. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve board adopted the final rule implementing Section 1075 ( the Durbin amendment ) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Effective October 1, 2011, the Durbin amendment capped the amount of debit interchange that large card issuers may charge on debit transactions. Our interchange expense decreased as a result of the Durbin amendment. We recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased for fiscal 2012 , as a result of lower interchange expense. We believe that any future benefits resulting from the Durbin amendment are uncertain due to our competitive marketplace. For fiscal 2012 , our Canadian revenue remained flat while our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 4.5% compared to the prior year period. Our Canadian business experienced reduced spreads due to market-driven pricing pressure as compared to the prior year. International Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2012 , International merchant services revenue increased 28.1% to $636.6 million. Our Europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2012 increased 36.1% to $489.3 million compared to the prior year. These revenue increases were driven primarily by the impact of our acquisition in Spain on December 20, 2010, pricing benefits in the United Kingdom and favorable foreign currency trends during fiscal 2012 . Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2012 increased 7.2% to $147.3 million compared to the prior year. The growth was due to solid business performance across the region. Revenues in the prior year included the roll-out of new products by a major retailer with both physical and e-commerce transactions in several markets in the region, continued growth of our installment payment plan and regional roll out of our dynamic currency conversion products. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operations- and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessments and other fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services; network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs 34 Table of Contents associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 18.0% during fiscal 2012 , compared to the prior year period primarily driven by revenue growth. As a percentage of revenues, cost of service decreased to 35.6% for fiscal 2012 from 35.8% in the prior year. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management; commissions paid to ISOs, independent contractors, and other third parties; advertising costs; other selling expenses; share-based compensation expense and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 19.0% for fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. This increase is primarily due to employee termination costs, charges for two contractual disputes, and an increase in commission payments to ISOs. As a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 46.6% for fiscal 2012 from 46.4% in the prior year. Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment increased 4.9% for fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating income was driven by growth in the U.S. primarily driven by our ISO and direct channels partially offset by market-based spread compression in Canada and, to a lesser extent, increased investment in Brazil. This resulted in operating margins decreasing during fiscal 2012 . The operating margin was 17.9% and 19.7% for the fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by ISO channel dilution, including the impact of the Durbin amendment, Canadian spread compression and costs associated with our start up in Brazil. Effective October 1, 2011, the new debit interchange legislation capped the amount of interchange that card issuers may charge on transactions. Our interchange expenses decreased as a result of this. We recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased as a result of lower interchange expense with a resulting increase in operating income as well. Increased revenues came primarily through our ISO channel, where reduced interchange fees led to higher revenues and a dollar-for-dollar increase in ISO commission expense, with an associated reduction in our operating margin. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 36.3% to $196.1 million for fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. The operating margin was 30.8% and 29.0% for the fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in operating margin in our International merchant services segment is due in part to pricing benefits in the United Kingdom arising from changes to merchant discount rates upon conversion of our merchant portfolio to our processing platform, which allows us to more closely align pricing with underlying transaction characteristics. In addition, the increase in operating margin is partially attributable to a marketing fee true-up in Spain, whereby CaixaBank compensated us for favorable pricing terms extended to certain CaixaBank customers during the initial phase of our marketing alliance agreement. Corporate Our corporate expenses include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, expenses related to our Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines that have not been allocated to our business segments, insurance, employee incentive programs, share-based compensation programs and certain corporate staff, including finance, accounting, information technology, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Our corporate costs increased 111.2% to $170.1 million for fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily due to costs associated with the processing system intrusion, employee termination costs and charges for two contractual disputes. The prior year corporate costs included expenses related to our Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines and employee and termination benefits. 35 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Income During the fiscal year 2012 , our consolidated operating income decreased $24.2 million to $307.3 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in our consolidated operating income is primarily due to costs associated with the processing system intrusion. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other expense, net, decreased to $6.9 million for fiscal 2012 compared to $7.4 million in the prior year period. Interest expense decreased during fiscal 2012 due to lower term loan borrowings. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were 27.6% and 29.3% for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended May 31, 2012 and 2011 reflect adjustments to our U.K. deferred tax asset due to legislated enacted corporate tax rate reductions in the United Kingdom of 2.0% and 1.0%, respectively. Our effective tax rates differ from U.S. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion. We have net deferred tax assets associated with our U.K. business of $92.8 million . The measurement of such deferred tax assets is based, in part, on the current enacted corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom. The 2012 United Kingdom budget includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 25.0% to 23.0%. Upon enactment of this rate, which was expected during the first half of our fiscal year 2013, we estimated that we will record a reduction in our U.K. deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision of approximately $5.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests, Net of Tax Noncontrolling interests, net of tax increased to $29.4 million from $18.9 million for the fiscal year 2012 and 2011, respectively. This increase is primarily due to our acquisition of a 51% controlling financial interest in Comercia on December 20, 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows. Cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, and to pay down debt and repurchase shares at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accumulated cash balances are invested in high quality and marketable short-term instruments. Our capital plan objectives are to support the Company operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. Lines of credit are used in certain of our markets to fund settlement and as a source of working capital and, along with other bank financing, to fund acquisitions. We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. At May 31, 2013 , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $680.5 million . Of this amount, we consider $255.0 million to be available cash. Our available cash balance includes $214.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered permanently reinvested for U.S. tax purposes. These cash balances reflect our capital investments in these subsidiaries and the accumulation of cash flows generated by each subsidiary's operations, net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund non-U.S. acquisitions. We believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. If we were to repatriate some or all of the cash held by such foreign subsidiaries, we do not believe that the associated income tax liabilities would have a significant impact on our liquidity. Available cash excludes settlement related and merchant reserve cash balances. Settlement related cash balances represent funds that we hold on behalf of our member sponsors when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member 36 Table of Contents sponsors' funding obligation to the merchant. Settlement related cash balances are not restricted; however these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. Merchant reserve cash balances represent funds collected from our merchants that serve as collateral ( Merchant Reserves ) to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement. At May 31, 2013 , our cash and cash equivalents included $280.7 million related to Merchant Reserves. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks. See Cash and cash equivalents and Settlement processing assets and obligations under Note 1 and Note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Operating activities provided net cash of $240.5 million during fiscal year 2013 compared to using net cash of $173.5 million during the prior year. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $464.3 million driven by the timing of month end cut-off. Net cash used in investing activities increased from $150.4 million to $528.6 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013 from the prior year, primarily due to our use of $409.3 million and $22.9 million for the acquisitions of APT and Civica, respectively, during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. For fiscal year 2013 , financing activities provided $183.5 million in cash compared to using $218.2 million in cash in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to proceeds of $700.0 million from the term loan and $80.5 million from net long-term revolver borrowings. We used $242.0 million of these proceeds to purchase the remaining 44% of GPAP from HSBC. We also repurchased 3,674,656 shares of our common stock with a cash payment of $175.3 million during fiscal year ended May 31, 2013. In addition, we made payments on term loans and notes payable in the amount of $126.0 million and we made net payments in the amount of $27.9 million on our short-term revolver. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. During fiscal year 2014, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $90.0 million. Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities Outstanding debt consisted of the following: 37 Table of Contents May 31, 2013 May 31, 2012 Lines of credit: (in thousands) Corporate Credit Facility - long-term $ 309,955 $ 229,500 Short-term lines of credit: United Kingdom Credit Facility 74,146 85,102 Hong Kong Credit Facility 38,134 54,564 Spain Credit Facility 28,041 17,241 Malaysia Credit Facility 14,025 12,844 Taiwan Credit Facility 8,359 Canada Credit Facility 6,866 20,033 Singapore Credit Facility 6,459 10,318 Philippines Credit Facility 6,384 6,336 Sri Lanka Credit Facility 1,978 2,291 Macau Credit Facility 1,966 2,443 Maldives Credit Facility 741 4,219 Brunei Credit Facility 362 Total short-term lines of credit $ 187,461 $ 215,391 Total lines of credit 497,416 444,891 Notes payable 6,014 10,089 Term loans 647,500 73,396 Total debt $ 1,150,930 $ 528,376 Current portion $ 259,796 $ 291,811 Long-term debt 891,134 236,565 Total debt $ 1,150,930 $ 528,376 Maturity requirements on outstanding debt by fiscal years are as follows (in thousands): 2014 $ 259,796 2015 71,472 2016 381,427 2017 70,735 2018 367,500 Total $ 1,150,930 Lines of Credit The Corporate Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes and to fund future strategic acquisitions. Our short-term lines of credit facilities are primarily used to fund settlement. For certain of our lines of credit facilities, the maximum borrowing amount may exceed the stated credit limit by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. Accordingly, the line of credit balance may exceed the stated credit limit at any given point in time, when in fact the combined position is less than the credit limit. The total available incremental borrowings under our Corporate Credit Facilities at May 31, 2013 was $440.0 million . As of May 31, 2013, we had $796.1 million available to fund settlement under our short-term lines of credit. 38 Table of Contents During the year ended May 31, 2013 , the maximum and average borrowings under our lines of credit were $871.9 million and $464.5 million , respectively. The weighted-average interest rates on these borrowings were 1.8% and 2.1% , respectively, for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2013 and May 31, 2012. Our maximum borrowed amount was greater than our average and period end borrowings due to the timing of settlement funding. Our line of credit facilities consist of the following: Corporate - an unsecured five -year, $750.0 million revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the Corporate Credit Facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. The multi-currency facility expires in December 2015 and has a variable interest rate based on a market short-term interest rate plus a leverage based margin. On September 28, 2012, the Corporate Credit Facility was expanded from $600.0 million to $750.0 million by requesting additional commitments from new and existing lenders. The Corporate Credit Facility contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. We plan to use the Corporate Credit Facility to support strategic growth initiatives and for general corporate purposes. As of May 31, 2013 , annual interest rate on the credit facility was 2.2% and the aggregate outstanding balance was $310.0 million .

Term Loans On September 28, 2012 , we entered into a five-year unsecured $700.0 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks, which we used to partially fund our acquisition of APT and our purchase of HSBC Asia's 44% interest in GPAP and to repay the outstanding balance on the Corporate Credit Facility. The term loan expires in September 2017 and bears interest, at our election, at the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus a leverage-based margin. As of May 31, 2013 , the annual interest rate on the term loan was 2.2% . The term loan has scheduled principal payments of $17.5 million at the end of each fiscal quarter through maturity. As of May 31, 2013 , the outstanding balance of the term loan was $647.5 million . On January 31, 2013, we repaid the outstanding balance of our five-year unsecured $200.0 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks in the United States.

These notes have fixed annual interest rates of 8.5% with maturity dates ranging from June 2013 through November 2016 . Compliance with Covenants 40 Table of Contents There are certain financial and non-financial covenants contained in our various credit facilities and term loans. Our term loan agreements include financial covenants requiring a leverage ratio no greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a fixed charge coverage ratio no less than 2.50 to 1.00 . We complied with these covenants as of and for the year ended May 31, 2013 . Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest As of May 31, 2012, we had a redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with our Asia-Pacific merchant services business. Global Payments Asia-Pacific Limited, or GPAP, is the entity through which we conduct our merchant acquiring business in the Asia-Pacific region. We owned 56% of GPAP and HSBC Asia owned the remaining 44% . The GPAP shareholders' agreement included provisions pursuant to which HSBC Asia could have compelled us to purchase, at the lesser of fair value or a net revenue multiple, additional GPAP shares from HSBC Asia (the Put Option ). Because the Put Option was not solely within our control, we classified this interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest and reported the maximum total redemption amount in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with current accounting guidance, we adjusted our redeemable noncontrolling interest to reflect the maximum redemption amount as of May 31, 2012 with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheet. On July 26, 2012 , outside the terms of the Put Option, we agreed to purchase all of HSBC Asia's interest in GPAP for $242.0 million . We accounted for the purchase of the remaining 44% of GPAP as an equity transaction with a reduction of redeemable noncontrolling interest of $146.0 million and a reduction of retained earnings of $96 million . In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ("ASC 480"), from the agreement date through the close of the transaction, we accounted for our commitment to purchase the remaining 44% of GPAP as a freestanding forward contract. Accordingly as of July 26, 2012 , we stopped attributing income to redeemable noncontrolling interest and any subsequent distributions to holders of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are characterized as interest expense. HSBC Asia is entitled to dividends through the closing of the transaction pursuant to the GPAP shareholders agreement and the purchase agreement. During fiscal 2013, we declared a dividend for fiscal year 2012 of which $8.4 million was paid to HSBC Asia. Such dividend is reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income in the accordance with the provisions of ASC 480. During fiscal year 2014 , we expect to declare an additional dividend related to GPAP operations through the closing date. We expect HSBC Asia's share of such dividend to be reflected in interest expense in our fiscal year 2014 consolidated statements of income. Data Center Relocation We have undertaken the relocation and redesign of our primary data center and processing system. We have entered into agreements related to this relocation and for the ongoing management of the data center , and we are contractually committed to make payments for the ongoing management of our data center through December 31, 2016. These obligations are included in the operating leases and purchase obligations line of the table presented below. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under Critical Accounting Estimates below. BIN/ICA Agreements In connection with our acquisition of merchant credit card operations of banks, we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain of the banks. These agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number ("BIN") for Visa transactions and Interbank Card Association ("ICA") number for MasterCard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through Visa and MasterCard. Certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of May 31, 2013 . Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2013 : 41 Table of Contents Payments Due by Future Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5+ Years (in thousands) Operating leases (Note 15) and purchase obligations $ 159,606 $ 35,935 $ 65,153 $ 39,182 $ 19,336 Total debt, including current portion (Note 7) 1,150,930 259,796 452,899 438,235 Interest on long-term debt (1) 49,370 14,209 23,345 11,816 (1) Interest on variable rate debt is based on rates effective and amounts borrowed as of May 31, 2013 . Note: This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, unrecognized tax benefits, and other current and long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these payments; therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. We do not have any material purchase commitments as of May 31, 2013 . Critical Accounting Policies In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. In many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have considered the impact of the processing system intrusion on our critical accounting estimates related to goodwill, long-lived asset and internally developed software valuations. We currently do not believe this event or associated business impacts represent an impairment indicator with respect to any of our goodwill reporting units, individual long-lived assets or asset groups, or internally developed software, whether placed in service or currently under development. Accordingly, we have not deemed it necessary to perform any interim goodwill impairment testing or impairment testing of internally developed software or other long-lived assets. If in future periods we experience or project diminished cash flows due to merchant attrition or other effects of the event, we will reassess the assumptions that underlie the estimates made in preparing our financial statements. Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this annual report. Reserve for operating losses As a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as operating losses. Merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. Check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. Please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses. We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, 42 we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults. We account for our potential liability for the full amount of the operating losses discussed above as guarantees. We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of estimated known losses and estimated incurred but not reported losses. Estimated known losses arise from specific instances of, for example, merchant bankruptcies, closures or fraud of which we are aware at the balance sheet date, but for which the ultimate amount of associated loss will not be determined until after the balance sheet date. Estimated known loss accruals are recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss is reasonably estimable. Estimated known losses are calculated at the merchant level based on chargebacks received to date, processed volume, and historical chargeback ratios. The estimate is reduced for any collateral that we hold. Accruals for estimated known losses are evaluated periodically and adjusted as appropriate based on actual loss experience. Incurred but not reported losses result from transactions that we process before the balance sheet date for which we have not yet received chargeback notification. We estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to our direct merchant credit card and signature debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. Historically, this estimation process has been materially accurate. For the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , our processed volume was $192.8 billion, $180.7 billion, and $167.3 billion, respectively. For these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $9.5 million , $8.8 million , and $6.0 million , respectively. As a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0049%, 0.0049%, and 0.0036%, respectively, during the above periods. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $9.9 million, $9.6 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. We believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended May 31, 2013 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.6 million. As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , $2.3 million has been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter's bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee loss reserve is comprised of estimated losses on returned checks and estimated incurred but not reported losses. We estimate the loss on returned checks by applying historical collection rates to our claims receivable balance. We estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to the face value of our guaranteed checks. For each of the years ended May 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , we guaranteed total check face values of $2.6 billion. For those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $11.7 million, $13.4 million, and $14.2 million, respectively. As a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.44%, 0.51%, and 0.55%, respectively. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $12.0 million, $13.8 million, and $14.5 million, respectively. We believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended May 31, 2013 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.8 million. Further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2013 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.51% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $1.1 million. As of May 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had a check guarantee reserve of $3.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six to twelve month analysis of historic loss activity. These assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors. For merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. For check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. Application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the economies in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Russian Federation at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers. Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by applying a fair value based test. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may exceed their fair values. When factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment of their carrying values by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test as of January 1, 2013. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and the impairment test consists of two steps. In the first step the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. Step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill. The excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss. We have six reporting units: North America Merchant Services, U.K. Merchant Services, Asia-Pacific Merchant Services, Central and Eastern Europe Merchant Services, Russia Merchant Services and Spain Merchant Services. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management's expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, EBITDA, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation. The market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. Multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow. Such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate. Preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions. Significant changes in our forecasts, the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. At May 31, 2013 , we had goodwill of $1,044.2 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We completed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test on January 1, 2013 and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of the carrying value. No events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 30 years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. We use the accelerated method of amortization for most our customer-related intangible assets. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. In addition, if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly than our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. During fiscal 2013 , we did not adjust the amortization schedules. We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. We use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks. Capitalization of Internally Developed Software We develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers. Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. Costs incurred prior to the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. Such impairment would result in a charge to income. Total software capitalized at May 31, 2013 was $167.1 million . Costs capitalized during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $29.2 million, $31.3 million, and $26.3 million, respectively. Internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years. Internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use. As of May 31, 2013, we have placed into service $92.2 million of hardware and software associated with our technology processing platform, referred to as G2; $5.7 million of which was placed in service during fiscal 2013. The vision for this platform is to serve as a front-end operating environment for merchant processing and is intended to replace a number of legacy platforms that have higher cost structures. Depreciation and amortization associated with these costs is calculated based on transactions expected to be processed over the life of the platform. We believe that this method is more representative of the platform's use than the straight-line method. We are currently processing transactions on our G2 platform in eight markets in our Asia-Pacific region and for a limited number of U.S. merchants. As these markets represent a small percentage of our overall transactions, depreciation and amortization related to our G2 platform for fiscal 2013 was not significant. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we complete migrations of other merchants to the G2 platform. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change. Judgment will be required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets will be adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. At May 31, 2013, our consolidated balance sheet includes net deferred tax assets associated with our United Kingdom business of $90.7 million. Our assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our projections of future business performance and viable tax planning strategies. If future business performance fails to meet projections, we may determine that some or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event of such a determination, we would record a valuation allowance for the amount deemed unrecoverable with a corresponding charge to the provision for income taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements From time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. In March 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2013-05, "Foreign Currency Matters" ("ASU 2013-05"). The amendments in ASU 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice about whether current literature applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice for the treatment of business combinations achieved in stages (sometimes also referred to as step acquisitions) involving a foreign entity. ASU 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013 . This standard is effective for us beginning June 1, 2014 . We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2013-05 on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, "Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities" ("ASU 2011-11"). The amendments in ASU 2011-11 require entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on an entity's financial position. The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (i) offset in accordance with current literature or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with current literature. ASU 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This standard will become effective for us beginning June 2013. The disclosures required by ASU 2011-11 will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. Table of Contents
