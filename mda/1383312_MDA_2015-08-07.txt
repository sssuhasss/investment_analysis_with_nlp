BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( GAAP ). These financial statements present the consolidated position of the Company. These financial statements include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under both the cost and equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASC No. 350 ), by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various 25 assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business weighted-average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $970.5 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2015 . Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. The Company performs a sensitivity analysis under Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC No. 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill. Income Taxes . We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC No. 740, Income Taxes, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). The Company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2015 , we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14.1 million , of which $0.5 million expires in 2017 through 2027 , and $13.6 million which has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, the Company has estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $37.4 million , which expire in 2015 through 2030 . Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $9.2 million and $10.9 million at June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses. Share-based Payments . ASC No. 718 Compensation Stock Compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $2.3 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.5 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.0 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. 26 IBM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES AGREEMENTS In March 2010, the Company and International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the IT Services Agreement ), under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The migration of data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022. In March 2015, the Company signed a two-year extension to the IT Services Agreement which expires on June 30, 2024. The Company has the right to renew the term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term. During the course of the migration to IBM, the Company incurred total migration costs of $85.6 million as part of establishing an operable IBM data center. We expensed $24.6 million of these costs in fiscal year 2012 and $6.3 million in fiscal year 2011. In addition, we capitalized $54.7 million of these costs and have amortized $16.4 million through June 30, 2015 . For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the Company recorded expenses of $95.3 million , $95.7 million and $96.3 million , respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to this agreement. In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited ( IBM UK ) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the EU IT Services Agreement ), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement expires in October 2023. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the EU IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term or one additional 24-month term. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 , and 2014, the Company recorded expenses of $4.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to this agreement. The Company capitalized $5.6 million related to the build-out of the IBM UK data center in Other non-current assets, with $0.4 million amortized into expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 , and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 . The Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments: Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs represents amortization charges associated with intangible asset values as well as other deal costs associated with the Company acquisitions. Net New Business refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses. Restructuring Charges refers to severance costs, facility exit costs, reorganization costs, the impact of system development costs for Apex Clearing Holdings LLC and the Canadian subsidiary of Penson Worldwide, Inc., and costs to restructure and outsource certain processing related to our desktop applications. The following definitions describe the Company Revenues: Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are: Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds. Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result 27 of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters. Proxy Contests and Special Events, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers. Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. During fiscal year 2015 , mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 2% lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 , mutual fund proxy revenues were 31% and 54% higher, respectively, than the prior fiscal year. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future. Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, and fulfillment services as well as Matrix Financial Solutions, Inc. ( Matrix ) administrative services. Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment as well as Matrix shareholder services fees. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues. Closed sales represent anticipated revenues for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge during the periods referenced. A sale is considered closed when the Company has received the signed client contract. For recurring revenue closed sales, the amount of the closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of annual revenues based on client volumes or activity, excluding pass-through revenues such as distribution revenues. Event-driven revenue closed sales primarily occur in our Investor Communication Solutions segment. The amount of the event-driven revenue closed sale is generally a reasonable estimate of production revenues based on client volumes or activity, excluding pass-through revenues such as distribution revenues. Broadridge determination of the amount of a closed sale is based on the client estimate of transaction volumes and activity levels, as our fees are largely based on transaction volume and activity levels. The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as closed sales. Larger recurring revenue closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. The majority of event-driven revenue closed sales are usually recognized during the year the contract is signed. The Company tracks actual revenue achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compares this to the amount that was included in the Company previously reported closed sales amount. The Company adjusts the current year closed sales amount for any difference between the prior year reported closed sales amount and the actual revenue achieved in the first year of the applicable contract. Closed sales were adjusted by $(3.1) million , $(0.8) million and $(5.9) million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Recurring revenue closed sales were adjusted by $(2.9) million , $(1.0) million and $(6.5) million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Event-driven revenue closed sales were adjusted by $(0.2) million , $0.2 million and $0.6 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 The table below presents Consolidated Statements of Earnings data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 , and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: 28 Years Ended June 30, 2015 2014 Change ($) (%) ($ in millions, except for per share amounts) Revenues $ 2,694.2 $ 2,558.0 $ 136.2 5 Cost of revenues 1,828.2 1,761.4 66.8 4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 396.8 376.0 20.8 6 Other expenses, net 30.3 25.1 5.2 21 Total expenses 2,255.3 2,162.5 92.8 4 Earnings before income taxes 438.9 395.5 43.4 11 Margin 16.3 % 15.5 % 0.8 pts Provision for income taxes 151.8 132.5 19.3 15 Effective tax rate 34.6 % 33.5 % 1.1 pts Net earnings $ 287.1 $ 263.0 $ 24.1 9 Basic earnings per share $ 2.39 $ 2.20 $ 0.19 9 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.32 $ 2.12 $ 0.20 9 Revenues . Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $2,694.2 million , an increase of $136.2 million , or 5% , compared to $2,558.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The $136.2 million increase was driven by increase d recurring fee revenues of $98.9 million or 6% , increase d distribution revenues of $44.9 million or 6% and increase d event-driven fee revenues of $17.2 million or 11% . The positive contribution from recurring fee revenues reflected gains from Net New Business (3pts), contributions from acquisitions (2pts) and internal growth (1pt). Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $24.8 million . Closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $221.5 million , an increase of $42.4 million , or 24% , compared to $179.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Recurring revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $146.4 million , an increase of $19.4 million , or 15% , compared to $127.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Event-driven closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $75.1 million , an increase of $23.0 million , or 44% , compared to $52.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Total Expenses . Total expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $2,255.3 million , an increase of $92.8 million compared to $2,162.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Cost of revenues were higher by $66.8 million , or 4% , Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher by $20.8 million , or 6% and Other expenses, net were higher by $ 5.2 million or 21% . Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $1,828.2 million , an increase of $66.8 million , compared to $1,761.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase reflects higher distribution cost of revenues of $42.4 million driven mostly by the increase in distribution revenues, higher costs related to acquisitions of $21.6 million and higher variable expenses driven primarily by the increase in recurring and event-driven fee revenues, partially offset by lower strategic initiative spend. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of fee revenues by $20.0 million due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $396.8 million , an increase of $20.8 million , or 6% , compared to $376.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase was primarily related to higher costs related to acquisitions of $10.0 million, higher selling and marketing expenses of $7.4 million as the Company continued to focus on increasing its sales capabilities, higher commissions of $6.3 million due to the growth in closed sales as discussed above, a $3.4 million change in the fair value of our obligations under contingent acquisition consideration arrangements, and a $2.9 million increase in costs related to corporate staffing changes in the current year, partially offset by lower strategic initiative spend. Other expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $30.3 million , an increase of $5.2 million , compared to $25.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase was primarily due to $5.5 million of losses from equity method investments and higher interest expenses on our Long-term borrowings of $1.7 million , slightly offset by a $1.0 million increase in interest income. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $438.9 million , an increase of $43.4 million , or 11% , compared to $395.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase is 29 mainly due to the contributions from the growth in revenues and operating leverage, both of which improved pre-tax margins from 15.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 to 16.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 . Provision for income taxes . The Provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $151.8 million and 34.6% , respectively, compared to $132.5 million and 33.5% , for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2015 being less than the cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2014. The cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2015 primarily related to the release of various tax reserves related to certain foreign, U.S. federal and state income taxes due to audit settlements and the expiration of certain audit periods, and the recognition of U.S. federal research and development credits based on the December 2014 legislative reinstatement of this credit for calendar year 2014 which collectively resulted in a net decrease to the effective tax rate of approximately 50 basis points. In fiscal year 2014 the cumulative tax benefits resulted in a net 85 basis point decrease to the effective tax rate. In addition to the lower cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2015 when compared to 2014, the change in the effective tax rate was also negatively impacted by the geographical mix of income. In general, the Company foreign earnings are subject to a lower corporate income tax rates relative to the tax rate applied against U.S. income. In fiscal year 2015, the Company foreign earnings were approximately 17% of total company earnings before income taxes as compared to fiscal year 2014 when the Company foreign earnings were approximately 22% of total company earnings before income taxes. Net earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share . Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $287.1 million , an increase of $24.1 million , or 9% , compared to $263.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . The increase in Net earnings reflects higher revenues, and improvement in pre-tax margins as discussed above. Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $2.39 , an increase of $0.19 , or 9% , and $2.32 , an increase of $0.20 , or 9% , respectively, compared to $2.20 and $2.12 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 , respectively. Fiscal Year 2014 Compared to Fiscal Year 2013 The table below presents Consolidated Statements of Earnings data for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 , and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2014 2013 Change ($) (%) ($ in millions, except for per share amounts) Revenues $ 2,558.0 $ 2,430.8 $ 127.2 5 Cost of revenues 1,761.4 1,767.8 (6.4 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 376.0 323.6 52.4 16 Other expenses, net 25.1 16.2 8.9 55 Total expenses 2,162.5 2,107.6 54.9 3 Earnings before income taxes 395.5 323.2 72.3 22 Margin 15.5 % 13.3 % 2.2 pts Provision for income taxes 132.5 111.1 21.4 19 Effective tax rate 33.5 % 34.4 % (0.9 ) pts Net earnings $ 263.0 $ 212.1 $ 50.9 24 Basic earnings per share $ 2.20 $ 1.74 $ 0.46 26 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.12 $ 1.69 $ 0.43 25 Revenues . Revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $2,558.0 million, an increase of $127.2 million, or 5%, compared to $2,430.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The $127.2 million increase was driven by higher recurring fee revenues of $131.2 million, higher distribution revenues of $9.7 million and higher event-driven fee revenues of $0.1 million. The positive contribution from recurring fee revenues reflected higher Net New Business, internal growth and acquisitions. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues by $13.7 million. Closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $179.1 million, an increase of $21.6 million, or 14%, compared to $157.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Recurring revenue closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $127.0 million, an increase of $6.2 million, or 5%, compared to $120.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 30 2013. Event-driven closed sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $52.1 million, an increase of $15.4 million, or 42%, compared to $36.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Total Expenses . Total expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $2,162.5 million, an increase of $54.9 million compared to $2,107.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The increase reflects higher Selling, general and administrative expenses of $52.4 million, or 16%, higher Other expenses, net of $8.9 million or 55%, partially offset by lower Cost of revenues of $6.4 million. Cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $1,761.4 million, a decrease of $6.4 million, compared to $1,767.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The decrease reflects lower Restructuring Charges of $9.6 million, savings related to the migration of the data center to IBM of $6.3 million and lower distribution cost of revenues of $1.2 million, offset by $12.3 million of higher costs related to acquisitions, higher investment spend of $10.9 million and a $5.0 million increase in performance based compensation expense. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of fee revenues by $10.3 million. Higher variable expenses were more than offset by savings from operating leverage and improved productivity from strategic initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $376.0 million, an increase of $52.4 million, or 16%, compared to $323.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The 16% increase was primarily due to higher performance based compensation expense of $23.4 million, higher investment spend of $16.3 million, higher sales and marketing expense of $8.0 million and higher costs related to acquisitions of $6.1 million partially offset by a $3.3 million adjustment due to a decrease in the fair value of our obligations under contingent acquisition consideration arrangements. Other expenses, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $25.1 million, an increase of $8.9 million, compared to $16.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The increased loss was primarily due to higher interest expenses on our Long-term borrowings of $10.0 million. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased Other expenses, net by $0.5 million. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $395.5 million, an increase of $72.3 million, or 22%, compared to $323.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The increase is mainly due to higher revenues and operating leverage coupled with the positive impact of improved productivity from strategic initiatives. Pre-tax margin increased from 13.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 to 15.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Provision for income taxes . The Provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $132.5 million and 33.5%, respectively, compared to $111.1 million and 34.4%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2014 exceeding the cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2013. The cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2014 primarily related to the release of a valuation allowance for a net operating loss carryforward in a foreign tax jurisdiction, and the release of various tax reserves related to certain foreign, U.S. federal and state income taxes due to audit settlements and the expiration of certain audit periods which resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate of approximately 115 basis points. In addition, the effective tax rate was also positively affected by approximately 30 basis points due to the characterization of a $3.3 million decrease in the fair value of obligations under contingent acquisition consideration arrangements as a deductible permanent tax item. Offsetting these positive benefits were various non-deductible permanent tax items that negatively impacted the tax rate by approximately 60 basis points. The cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 primarily consisted of the recognition of a previous period foreign tax credits. In addition to the higher cumulative tax benefits in fiscal year 2014, the change in the effective tax rate was marginally positively impacted by the geographical mix of income. In general, the Company foreign earnings are subject to a lower corporate income tax rate relative to the tax rate applied against U.S. income. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, there was no material change in foreign earnings as a percentage of total Net earnings when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 3013. The geographical mix of income may impact the effective tax rate in future periods as the geographical mix of the Company business changes. Net earnings and Basic and Diluted earnings per share . Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $263.0 million, an increase of $50.9 million, or 24%, compared to $212.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The increase in Net earnings reflects higher revenues, increased pre-tax margins from higher margin revenue business and the positive impact of improved productivity from strategic initiatives. Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were $2.20, an increase of $0.46, or 26%, and $2.12, an increase of $0.43, or 25%, respectively, compared to $1.74 and $1.69 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, respectively. 31 ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Broadridge has two reportable operating business segments: (1) Investor Communication Solutions and (2) Global Technology and Operations (formerly known as Securities Processing Solutions). The primary components of Other are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. Foreign exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and budgeted foreign exchange rates. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit. In connection with an organizational change made in 2014 in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services, certain discrete services that were previously reported in our Global Technology and Operations reportable segment are now reported within the Investor Communication Solutions reportable segment. As a result, our prior period segment results have been revised to reflect this change in reporting segments.

Recurring fee revenue growth of 9% was the result of contributions from Net New Business (3 pts) from increases in revenue from closed sales, internal growth driven by market-based activities (3 pts), and contributions from our recent acquisitions (3 pts). Position growth, a component of internal growth, for mutual fund interim and annual equity proxy communications, was 8% and 7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Higher event-driven fee revenues were the result of increased equity proxy specials and contests. Earnings before income taxes . Earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were $381.4 million , an increase of $45.1 million , or 13% , compared to $336.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 . Pre-tax margins increased by 0.9 percentage points to 18.8% mainly due to contributions from the growth in revenues more than offsetting higher Selling, general and administrative expenses from acquisitions, the continued expansion of our sales capabilities, higher commissions due to growth in closed sales, and losses from equity method investments.

Higher recurring fee revenues were driven by internal growth and Net New Business. Position growth for mutual fund interim communications and annual equity proxy communications were positive 11% and 8%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Our internal growth reflects an increase in favorable position growth and fulfillment related market activity.

Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) except where otherwise noted. In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ( Non-GAAP ). These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company reported results. With regard to statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that include certain Non-GAAP financial measures, the adjusted earnings measures are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance. We also provide information on our Free cash flows because we believe this information helps our investors understand the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Free cash flows is a Non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles. The Company believes Non-GAAP financial information helps investors understand the effect of these items on our reported results and provides a better representation of our operating performance. These Non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between our current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Set forth below is a reconciliation of such Non-GAAP measures (unaudited) to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: 34 Years ended June 30, 2015 2014 2013 ($ in millions) Adjusted Net earnings (Non-GAAP) $ 306.9 $ 279.0 $ 236.0 Adjustments: Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs, net of taxes (19.8 ) (16.0 ) (15.3 ) Restructuring Charges, net of taxes (13.0 ) Discrete tax items 4.4 Net earnings (GAAP) $ 287.1 $ 263.0 $ 212.1 Years ended June 30, 2015 2014 2013 Adjusted Diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $ 2.47 $ 2.25 $ 1.88 Adjustments: Acquisition Amortization and Other Costs, net of taxes (0.16 ) (0.13 ) (0.12 ) Restructuring Charges, net of taxes (0.10 ) Discrete tax items 0.03 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 2.32 $ 2.12 $ 1.69 Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.

Total stockholders equity was $927.8 million and $961.7 million at June 30, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. At June 30, 2015 , net working capital was $352.5 million , compared to $396.2 million at June 30, 2014 . At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. As of June 30, 2015 , $209.1 million of the $324.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $42.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations, as we consider these funds to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. On December 28, 2012, Broadridge, the IRS and the Canada Revenue Agency entered into an advance pricing agreement ( APA ) relating to tax years 2007 through 2012. Under the APA, a net $50.0 million of cash was transferred from two of the 35 Company Canadian subsidiaries to the Broadridge U.S. parent company during the Company third fiscal quarter of 2013. All tax effects pertaining to this APA were accrued in the prior fiscal year.
