ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Industry Conditions. The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market. As such, financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability, high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity, low rates and constrained profitability. Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels. We compete in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide addition al sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. Worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive, particularly in the casualty lines of business. Generally, there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand. We noted, however, that in many markets and lines during 2009 and 2010, the rates of decline have slowed, pricing in some segments was relatively flat and there was upward movement in some others, particularly property catastrophe coverage in Latin America and Australia where there have been significant losses. Competition and its effect on rates, terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continues to be most prevalent in the U.S. casualty insurance and reinsurance markets. The U.S. insurance markets in which we participate were extremely competitive as we ll. Rates in the international markets have generally been stable and we have seen some increases, particularly for catastrophe exposed business. We have grown our business in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. Overall, we believe that current marketplace conditions offer pockets of profit opportunities for us given our strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. We continue to employ our strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in our overall portfolio. 45 Table of Contents Financial Summary. We monitor and evaluate our overall performance based upon financial results.

Revenues. Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by $71.8 million, or 1.7%, in 2010, compared to 2009, reflecting an increase of $63.7 million in our reinsurance business and $8.1 million increase in our insurance business. The increase in reinsurance premiums was primarily the result of increased writings in our U.S. treaty property and international books of business, driven by a combination of new business, increased participations on renewal contracts, rate increases in select areas, and economic and insurance growth in several regions. The increase in insurance premiums was due to increased writings in professional liability and California workers compensation business, partially offset by a reduction in the audit premium a ccrual for workers compensation business. Net written premiums increased $15.8 million, or 0.4%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The lower increase in net written premiums relative to the change in gross written premiums was due to the increased use of reinsurance on several large programs in the insurance book. Premiums earned increased $40.5 million, or 1.0%, in 2010, compared to 2009. The change in net premiums earned is relatively consistent with the increase in net written premiums. 46 Table of Contents Gross written premiums increased by $450.8 million, or 12.3%, in 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting an increase of $380.1 million in our reinsurance business and $70.8 million in our insurance business. The increased reinsurance business was primarily attributable to increased rates on property business, in both the international and U.S. markets, new crop hail quota share treaty business, expanded participation on renewal contracts and new writings as ceding companies continued to favor reinsurers, such as Everest, with strong financial ratings. The increase in insurance premiums were primarily in the workers compensation and financial institution D&O and E&O lines of business, which were new offerings for us in 2009. Net written premiums increased $424.5 million, or 12.1%, in 2009 c ompared to 2008. The increases in net written premiums are primarily due to the increase in gross written premiums. Premiums earned increased $199.8 million, or 5.4%, in 2009 compared to 2008, reflective of the higher net written premiums. The change in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period, whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. Net Investment Income. Net investment income increased $105.7 million, or 19.3%, in 2010 compared with net investment income of $547.8 million in 2009, primarily as a result of an $89.7 million increase in investment income from our limited partnerships. Net pre-tax investment income, as a percentage of average invested assets, was 4.5% in 2010 compared to 3.8% for 2009. The variance in this yield was primarily the result of fluctuations in our limited partnership income. Net investment income decreased by 3.2% in 2009, compared to 2008, due primarily to lower yields on new money, partially offset by a decrease in losses from our limited partnership investments that invest in public and non-public securities, both equity and debt. As a result, net pre-tax investment income, as a percentage of average invested assets, was 3.8% for 2009 compared to 4.0% for 2008. Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses). Net realized capital gains were $101.9 million in 2010 compared to net realized capital losses of $2.3 million and $695.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of the $101.9 million, there were $70.4 million of gains in fair value re-measurements and $34.5 million from net realized capital gains from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities, which were partially offset by $3.0 million of other-than-temporary impairments. The net realized capital loss of $2.3 million in 2009, was the result of $29.3 million of net realized capital losses from sales and $13.2 million in other-than-temporary impairments on our available for sale fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a $40.2 million gain in fair value re-measurements. The net realized capital losses in 2008 were primarily the result of the credit crisis impacting the global financial markets, which drove down the values of equity and fixed income securities. The components of the $695.8 million of realized losses in 2008 were $276.0 million of losses in fair value re-measurements, $243.3 million of net realized capital losses from sales and $176.5 million in other-than-temporary impairments on our available for sale fixed maturity securities. Realized Gain on Debt Repurchase. On March 19, 2009, we commenced a cash tender offer for any and all of the 6.60% fixed to floating rate long term subordinated notes due 2067. Upon expiration of the tender offer, we had reduced our outstanding debt by $161.4 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain on debt repurchase of $78.3 million. Net Derivative Gain (Loss). In 2005 and prior, we sold seven equity index put option contracts, which are outstanding. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative in accordance with FASB guidance and as such, are fair valued each quarter with the change recorded as net derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As a result of these adjustments in value, we recognized a net derivative loss of $1.1 million in 2010, a net derivative gain of $3.2 million in 2009 and a net derivative loss of $20.9 million in 2008. The change in the fair value of these equity index put option contracts is indicative of the change in the financial markets over the same periods. Other Income (Expense). We recorded other income of $16.9 million and other expense of $22.5 million and $15.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The changes were primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the corresponding periods. 47 Table of Contents Claims and Expenses. Incurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. The following table presents our incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ) for the periods indicated.

(b) Effective with the 2010 reporting period, a catastrophe is a property event with expected reported losses of at least $10.0 million. All prior periods reflect a catastrophe as a property event with expected reported losses of at least $5.0 million. (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Incurred losses and LAE increased by $571.6 million, or 24.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Of the $571.6 million increase, current year catastrophe losses increased $522.7 million (13.3 points), period over period, primarily due to losses on the Chilean earthquake, New Zealand earthquake, Australian hailstorms and floods, and the Canadian hailstorm. The current year attritional losses also increased $208.7 million (4.8 points) reflecting higher expected loss ratios on current year business due to prevailing market conditions. Partially offsetting these higher current year losses was a decrease of $159.6 million, or 4.1 points, in prior year loss development as the 2010 reserve studies indicated net favorable reserve development and loss estimates for prior year catastrophes were reduced. Incurred losses and LAE were lower by $64.9 million, or 2.7%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The absence, in 2009, of any large catastrophe losses as experienced in 2008, reduced the loss ratio 8.0 points, or $290.0 million, period over period. Partially offsetting the reduction in catastrophe losses was the increase in both current and prior years attritional losses. The $131.1 million increase in current year attritional losses was principally due to the increase in earned premium from 2008 to 2009. The $100.4 million increase in prior years attritional losses was primarily due to increased reserves for exposure related to sub-prime and contractors liability. 48 Table of Contents Commission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $3.5 million, or 0.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The change was primarily the result of an increase in premiums earned, as the commission ratio, year over year, was comparable. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $2.4 million, or 0.3%, in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The change in this directly variable expense was influenced by reduction in contingent commissions and changes in the mix of business. Other Underwriting Expenses. Other underwriting expenses, which have remained stable in relation to premium volume, were $166.3 million, $167.2 million and $148.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses, which are expenses that are not allocated to segments, were $14.9 million, $17.6 million and $13.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These expenses were previously included as underwriting expenses and therefore included in the other underwriting expense ratio. Effective January 1, 2010, these expenses were removed from the calculation of the other underwriting expense ratio and prior periods were recalculated to conform. Interest, Fees and Bond Issue Cost Amortization Expense. Interest, fees and other bond amortization expense was $55.8 million and $72.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the combination of the repurchase of debt in March 2009 and the maturing of debt in 2010. Interest, fees and other bond amortization was $72.1 million and $79.2 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease, period over period, was primarily due to the partial repurchase of our long term subordinated notes in March 2009. Income Tax Expense (Benefit). We had income tax benefit of $19.5 million in 2010, an income tax expense of $132.3 million in 2009 and an income tax benefit of $64.8 million in 2008. Our income tax is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding pre-tax income in the jurisdictions where we operate, coupled with the impact from tax-preferenced investment income. The taxes for 2010 included a $48.9 million benefit resulting from a favorable Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) audit settlement. Absent these types of unusual items, variations in our effective tax rate generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income among jurisdictions with different tax rates. Net Income (Loss). Our net income was $610.8 million and $807.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by a few large catastrophe losses in 2010 compared to no similar catastrophe events in 2009, partially offset by an increase in net realized capital gains and a reduction in income taxes, in addition to the other components discussed above. Our net income was $807.0 million, in 2009, compared to a net loss of $18.8 million, in 2008. This increase was primarily driven by smaller after-tax net realized capital losses and fewer catastrophe losses in 2009 compared to 2008. Ratios. Our combined ratio increased by 13.7 points to 102.8% in 2010 compared to 89.1% in 2009. The loss ratio component increased 13.9 points in 2010 over the same period last year, principally due to the increase in current year catastrophe losses as a result of the Chilean earthquake, Australian hailstorms and floods, New Zealand earthquake and the Canadian hailstorm. Both the other underwriting expense ratio component and the commission and brokerage ratio component remained relatively flat over the same periods last year. Our combined ratio decreased by 6.1 points to 89.1% in 2009 compared to 95.2% in 2008. The loss ratio component decreased 5.0 points in 2009 compared to the same period last year, principally due to the significant decrease in catastrophe losses. The commission and brokerage ratio component decreased by 1.4 points in 2009 compared to the same period last year, due to mix of business, while the other 49 Table of Contents underwriting expense ratio component increased by 0.3 points in 2009 compared to the same period last year. Shareholders Equity. Shareholders equity increased by $181.8 million to $6,283.5 million at December 31, 2010 from $6,101.7 million at December 31, 2009, principally as a result of $610.8 million of net income, $60.2 million of unrealized appreciation, net of tax, on investments, share-based compensation transactions of $17.8 million and $1.9 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by repurchases of 5.1 million common shares for $398.6 million, $108.5 million of shareholder dividends and $1.8 million of benefit plan obligation adjustments. Shareholders equity increased by $1,141.4 million to $6,101.7 million at December 31, 2009 from $4,960.4 million at December 31, 2008, principally as a result of $807.0 million of net income, $529.9 million of unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax, $83.8 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and share-based compensation transactions of $22.5 million, partially offset by 2.4 million common share repurchases for $190.6 million and $116.9 million of shareholder dividends. Consolidated Investment Results Net Investment Income. Net investment income increased by 19.3% to $653.5 million in 2010 compared to $547.8 million in 2009, primarily due to an increase in income from our limited partnership investments and increased dividend income from equities due to our expanded equity portfolio. Net investment income decreased 3.2% to $547.8 million in 2009 from $565.9 million in 2008, primarily due to lower yields on new money, partially offset by a decrease in losses from our limited partnership investments that invest in public and non-public securities, both equity and debt. The following table shows the components of net investment income for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Fixed maturities $ 581.9 $ 570.8 $ 543.4 Equity securities 12.2 3.6 19.9 Short-term investments and cash 0.2 6.0 52.1 Other invested assets Limited partnerships 70.7 (19.0 ) (42.2 ) Other 1.3 0.1 2.3 Total gross investment income 666.2 561.4 575.5 Interest debited (credited) and other expense (12.8 ) (13.6 ) (9.6 ) Total net investment income $ 653.5 $ 547.8 $ 565.9 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)

The following table provides a comparison of our total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated: 2010 2009 2008 Fixed income portfolio total return 5.3% 9.4% 0.3% Barclay's Capital - U.S. aggregate index 6.5% 5.9% 5.2% Common equity portfolio total return 15.4% 28.9% -40.9% S&P 500 index 15.1% 26.5% -37.0% Other invested asset portfolio total return 18.7% -1.8% -7.4% The pre-tax equivalent total return for the bond portfolio was approximately 5.7%, 10.1% and 1.0%, respectively, in 2010, 2009 and 2008. The pre-tax equivalent return adjusts the yield on tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent. Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses). The following table presents the composition of our net realized capital gains (losses) for the periods indicated.

In 2010, we recorded $70.4 million of gains due to fair value re-measurements on fixed maturity and equity securities, $34.5 million of net realized capital gains from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities, partially offset by $3.0 million of other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities. The gains on the sales of fixed maturity securities included selling securities in foreign currencies, which will reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations in the future. The losses included the impact of selling part of our municipal bond portfolio in the latter part of the year as credit concerns arose in this market sec tor. We will be able to carry these realized losses back for income tax purposes to offset previously realized gains. This carry back availability expired at the end of 2010. In 2009, we recorded $29.3 million of net realized capital losses from sales of fixed maturity and equity securities and $13.2 million of other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by $40.2 million of gains due to fair value re-measurements on fixed maturity and equity securities. In 2008, we recorded $276.0 million in losses due to fair value re-measurements primarily on equity securities as a result of the global financial markets credit crisis, $243.3 million of losses from sales of our equity portfolio and $176.5 million of other-than-temporary impairments on our available for sale fixed maturity securities. Segment Results. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents, brokers and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes non-U.S. property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re branches in Canada and Singapore and offices in Brazil, Miami and New Jersey. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch and the Company Ireland subsidiary. These segments are managed independently, but conform with corporate guidelines with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. We measure our underwriting results using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned. We utilize inter-affiliate reinsurance, although such reinsurance does not materially impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced. Our loss and LAE reserves are our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including all prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, recently reported loss claim experience and trends related to prior periods. Such re-evaluations are recorded in incurred losses in the period in which re-evaluation is made. 52 Table of Contents The following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods indicated. U.S. Reinsurance. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Reinsurance segment for the periods indicated.

Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 2.4% to $1,143.7 million in 2010 from $1,172.3 million in 2009, primarily due to a $40.7 million (48.2%) decrease in the crop hail quota share treaties, a $32.4 million (8.9%) decrease in U.S. treaty casualty volume and a $28.6 million (29.2%) decrease in facultative volume, partially offset by a $73.7 million (11.8%) increase in treaty property volume. Net written premiums decreased 1.9% to $1,145.2 million in 2010 compared to $1,167.2 million in 2009, which is in line with the decline in gross written premiums. Correspondingly, premiums earned decreased 1.8% to $1,129.3 million in 2010 compared to $1,150.3 million in 2009. Gross written premiums increased by 22.4% to $1,172.3 million in 2009 from $957.9 million in 2008, primarily due to $103.9 million (40.0%) increase in U.S. treaty casualty volume, $84.6 million from the new crop hail quota share treaties, a $15.8 million (2.6%) increase in treaty property volume and a $10.5 million (12.0%) increase in facultative volume. Our treaty casualty premiums were higher as we wrote more quota share business as a replacement for more business written on an excess of loss basis. Net written premiums increased 23.0% to $1,167.2 million in 2009 compared to $948.8 million in 2008, relatively in line with the increase in gross written premiums. Premiums earned increased 9.5% to $1,150.3 million in 2009 compared to $1,050.3 million in 2008. The change in premiums earned relative t o net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums, for proportionate contracts, are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. 53 Table of Contents Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses were $131.5 million (12.5 points) higher at $706.3 million in 2010 compared to $574.8 million in 2009, primarily as a result of the $62.3 million (6.4 points) increase in current year attritional losses, reflective of current competitive market conditions, $28.5 million (2.5 points) increase in prior year attritional losses, and a $41.2 million (3.6 points) increase in catastrophe losses, largely due to the New Zealand earthquake and the Chilean earthquake. The increase in prior years attritional losses was primarily driven by reserve strengthening in casualty lines for construction liability claims. Incurred losses were $223.4 million (26.0 points) lower at $574.8 million in 2009 compared to $798.2 million in 2008, primarily as a result of the $281.0 million (26.7 points) decrease in catastrophe losses due to the absence of current year catastrophes in 2009. The prior years reserve development in 2009 primarily related to sub-prime liability exposures. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage expenses increased by 4.6% to $284.6 million in 2010 compared to $272.2 million in 2009, primarily due to a shift in the mix of business across lines with different commission rates. Segment other underwriting expenses in 2010 decreased slightly to $33.9 million from $36.2 million in 2009. Commission and brokerage expenses decreased by 0.4% to $272.2 million in 2009 compared to $273.3 million in 2008, primarily due to the change in the mix and type of business written. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2009 increased to $36.2 million from $32.2 million for 2008, due to growth in the overall infrastructure. 54 Table of Contents U.S. Insurance. The following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Insurance segment for the periods indicated. Years Ended December 31, 2010/2009 2009/2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Variance % Change Variance % Change Gross written premiums $ 850.7 $ 842.6 $ 771.8 $ 8.1 1.0 % $ 70.8 9.2 % Net written premiums 605.6 656.2 617.0 (50.6 ) -7.7 % 39.2 6.4 % Premiums earned $ 626.4 $ 671.1 $ 705.5 $ (44.7 ) -6.7 % $ (34.4 ) -4.9 % Incurred losses and LAE 527.5 538.6 549.9 (11.2 ) -2.1 % (11.2 ) -2.0 % Commission and brokerage 118.1 124.4 146.7 (6.2 ) -5.0 % (22.3 ) -15.2 % Other underwriting expenses 69.7 74.6 64.3 (5.0 ) -6.6 % 10.3 16.0 % Underwriting gain (loss) $ (88.9 ) $ (66.5 ) $ (55.4 ) $ (22.4 ) 33.6 % $ (11.1 ) 20.1 % Point Chg Point Chg Loss ratio 84.2 % 80.3 % 77.9 % 3.9 2.4 Commission and brokerage ratio 18.9 % 18.5 % 20.8 % 0.4 (2.3 ) Other underwriting expense ratio 11.1 % 11.1 % 9.2 % - 1.9 Combined ratio 114.2 % 109.9 % 107.9 % 4.3 2.0 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 1.0% to $850.7 million in 2010 compared to $842.6 million in 2009. This was primarily due to increased writings in professional liability and California workers compensation business partially offset by a reduction in audit premiums for workers compensation business. Net written premiums decreased 7.7% to $605.6 million compared to $656.2 million in 2009 due to an increase in the use of reinsurance on several large programs. Ceded premiums generally relate to specific reinsurance purchased and fluctuate based upon the level of premiums written in the individual reinsured programs. Premiums earned decreased 6.7% to $626.4 million in 2010 compared to $671.1 million in 2009. The change in premiums earned is relatively consistent with the decrease in net written premium. Gross written premiums increased by 9.2% to $842.6 million in 2009 compared to $771.8 million for 2008. Most of the new premium was derived from our entry into the financial institution D&O and E&O market and additional property insurance written in Florida, where rates to exposure remained attractive. Net written premiums increased by 6.4% to $656.2 million in 2009 compared to $617.0 million in 2008, as the increase in gross written premiums was partially offset by the increase in ceded written premiums. Premiums earned decreased 4.9% to $671.1 million in 2009 compared to $705.5 million in 2008. The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. 55 Table of Contents Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses and LAE decreased by 2.1% to $527.5 million in 2010 compared to $538.6 million in 2009. The decrease was due to lower net premiums earned, partially offset by an increase in the attritional loss ratio, year over year. Current year attritional losses increased $11.1 million (6.8 points), due to higher expected loss ratios on several programs, reflective of current market conditions. Offsetting the increase in current year losses was a decrease of $22.2 million (2.9 points) in prior years loss development compared to 2009. The 2010 prior years unfavorable development of $36.8 million was primarily the result of reserve strengthening on several terminated programs. Incurred losses and LAE decreased by 2.0% to $538.6 million in 2009 compared to $549.9 million in 2008. This decrease was due to the decrease in net earned premiums, partially offset by the increase in the loss ratio, period over period. Prior years attritional losses were $10.1 million less unfavorable in 2009 compared to 2008. The 2009 unfavorable development of $59.0 million was primarily the result of reserve strengthening on contractors liability programs, package policy business and workers compensation business. The 2008 unfavorable development of $69.1 million was primarily the result of $85.3 million reserve strengthening for an auto loan credit insurance program, partially offset by $16.2 million in favorable prior years reserve development. div> Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased by 5.0% to $118.1 million in 2010 compared to $124.4 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in net premiums earned and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses decreased to $69.7 million in 2010 compared to $74.6 million in 2009. This decrease was the result of management direct actions to reduce operating expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased by 15.2% to $124.4 million in 2009 compared to $146.7 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the mix of business written and the reinsurance purchased on the business written. Segment other underwriting expenses in 2009 increased to $74.6 million compared to $64.3 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the expanded infrastructure. 56 Table of Contents Specialty Underwriting.

Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 13.5% to $266.4 million in 2010 compared to $234.8 million in 2009, primarily due to an increase in A&H business with its entry into the stop-loss primary market for coverages on self-insured companies in 2010 and increased writings on special per risk reinsurance programs. Correspondingly, net written premiums increased 14.0% to $262.2 million in 2010 compared to $230.0 million in 2009. Premiums earned increased 16.1% to $272.3 million in 2010 compared to $234.5 million in 2009, relatively consistent with the increase in net written premiums. Gross written premiums decreased by 9.8% to $234.8 million in 2009 compared to $260.4 million for 2008, primarily due to a $33.7 million decrease in marine premiums and a $5.9 million decrease in surety premiums, partially offset by a $10.0 million increase in aviation premiums and a $2.7 million increase in A&H premiums. Net written premiums decreased 9.5% to $230.0 million in 2009 compared to $254.2 million in 2008, in line with the decrease in gross writings. Premiums earned decreased 6.8% to $234.5 million in 2009 compared to $251.8 million in 2008. The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. 57 Table of Contents Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses and LAE increased by 24.8% to $203.9 million in 2010 compared to $163.4 million in 2009, due to an increase in net premiums earned coupled with an increase in the loss ratio. Current year attritional losses increased $32.7 million (2.5 points) as a result of losses on the offshore oil rig in the Gulf and higher expected loss ratios in A&H and surety lines of business. In addition, prior years attritional losses increased $8.1 million (3.2 points) due to unfavorable reserve development on select specialty classes of business in 2010 compared to favorable reserve development in 2009. Incurred losses and LAE decreased by 1.5% to $163.4 million for 2009 compared to $165.9 million in 2008, primarily as a result of a decrease in catastrophe losses on the marine book of business, period over period. Partially offsetting this decrease were the proportionally higher current year attritional losses on the marine business in addition to less favorable reserve development on prior years attritional losses on most of the Specialty Underwriting lines. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased 4.1% to $69.6 million in 2010 compared to $72.6 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to changes in the mix of business, with a higher level of excess of loss marine business and primary A&H business in 2010, both of which carry lower commission ratios. Lower contingent commissions on the surety and aviation books of business, driven by changes in the expected profitability of this business also favorably impacted the commission ratio. Segment other underwriting expenses decreased slightly to $8.6 million in 2010 compared to $8.7 million in 2009. Commission and brokerage increased 2.5% to $72.6 million in 2009 compared to $70.8 million in 2008 as commissions increased on the A&H business. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2009 increased slightly to $8.7 million compared to $8.1 million for 2008. 58 Table of Contents International.

Premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 11.3% to $1,207.0 million in 2010 compared to $1,084.5 million in 2009, due to continued strong growth in premiums written through the Brazil, Miami and New Jersey offices, a $42.7 million increase; Asia, a $55.7 million increase; and Canada, a $24.2 million increase; resulting from a combination of new business, rate increases in select areas, and economic and insurance growth in some markets. Also contributing to the increase was $16.0 million in reinstatement premiums from the Chilean earthquake and Calgary hailstorm. Net written premiums increased by 10.9% to $1,199.6 million in 2010 compared to $1,081.3 million in 2009, principally as a result of the increase in gross written premiums. Premiums earned increased 10.9% to $1,168.1 million in 2010 compared to $1,053.5 million in 2009, consistent with the trend noted for net written premiums. Gross written premiums increased by 19.9% to $1,084.5 million in 2009 compared to $904.7 million in 2008. As a result of our strong financial strength ratings, we saw increased participations on treaties in most regions, new business writings and preferential signings, including preferential terms and conditions. In addition, rates, in some markets, also contributed to the increased written premiums. Premiums written through the Brazil, Miami and New Jersey offices increased by $122.9 million (21.3%), the Asian branch increased by $32.4 million (17.1%) and the Canadian branch premiums increased by $24.5 million (17.7%). Net written premiums increased by 19.9% to $1,081.3 million in 2009 compared to $902.1 million in 2008, principally as a result of the increase in gross written premiums. Premiums earned increased 19.0% to $1,053.5 million in 2009 compared to $885.5 million in 2008, consistent with the increase in net written premiums. 59 Table of Contents Incurred Losses and LAE. The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the International segment for the periods indicated.

Incurred losses and LAE increased 71.2% to $1,050.1 million in 2010 compared to $613.3 in 2009. The increase was principally due to a $417.3 million (35.3 points) increase in current year catastrophes related to the Chilean earthquake, the Australian hailstorms and floods, the New Zealand earthquake and the Canadian hailstorm compared to the absence in 2009 of any similar large events. Attritional losses also increased, primarily due to an increase in premiums earned and higher expected loss ratios, which were partially offset by favorable development on prior years reserves. Incurred losses and LAE increased 21.5% to $613.3 million in 2009 compared to $504.8 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to reserve strengthening of prior years non-catastrophe attritional losses in 2009 of $19.4 million compared to 2008 favorable prior years non-catastrophe attritional development of $33.5 million. Current year attritional losses were higher primarily due to the increase in earned premiums. Current year catastrophe losses were flat year over year. Segment Expenses . Commission and brokerage increased 8.0% to $288.4 million in 2010 compared to $267.1 million in 2009. The increase was primarily in line with the increases in premiums earned. Segment other underwriting expenses increased to $27.6 million in 2010 compared to $23.1 million in 2009. The increase was consistent with the growth in premiums earned resulting in stable other underwriting expense ratios for the periods. Commission and brokerage increased 15.7% to $267.1 million in 2009 compared to $230.9 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the growth in premiums earned in conjunction with the blend of business mix. Segment other underwriting expenses in 2009 increased to $23.1 million compared to $19.8 million in 2008, consistent with growth in business. 60 Table of Contents Bermuda.

Premiums. Gross written premiums decreased 7.8% to $733.0 million in 2010 compared to $794.8 million in 2009. Bermuda home office business was down 4.4%, or $12.8 million, due to lower property catastrophe excess of loss business. Premiums written by the U.K. branch and Ireland subsidiary in the U.K. and continental Europe, decreased $49.0 million, or 9.7% in response to softening market conditions. Net written premiums decreased 7.8% to $733.0 million in 2010 compared to $795.1 million in 2009, in line with the decrease in gross written premiums. Premiums earned decreased 5.9% to $738.4 million in 2010 compared to $784.6 million in 2009. The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage period. Gross written premiums increased 1.5% to $794.8 million in 2009 compared to $783.4 million in 2008. The Bermuda home office gross written premium increased $33.0 million, or 12.8%. Premiums written out of the UK branch decreased $21.3 million, or 4.1%, as a result of the change in foreign exchange rates period over period. Excluding the impact of the foreign exchange, the branch premiums were up approximately 15.7%. Net written premiums also increased 1.5% to $795.1 million in 2009 compared to $783.1 million in 2008. Premiums earned decreased 2.1% to $784.6 million in 2009 compared to $801.2 million in 2008. 61 Table of Contents Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred losses and LAE decreased 5.4% to $457.9 million in 2010 compared to $484.0 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the favorable development on prior years attritional and catastrophe reserves, partially offset by current year catastrophe losses from the Chilean earthquake, New Zealand earthquake and Australian hailstorms. The 2010 prior year favorable development primarily emanated from casualty business written by the Bermuda office. Incurred losses and LAE increased 15.2% to $484.0 million in 2009 compared to $420.3 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the change in prior years attritional reserve development to unfavorable development of $19.4 million in 2009 from favorable development of $56.6 million in 2008, principally generated by the UK branch business. A portion of this change, $39.3 million, is strengthening of reserves on our sub-prime exposure. Partially offsetting the increase was a $10.8 million reduction in catastrophes, period over period. Segment Expenses. Commission and brokerage decreased 10.9% to $171.1 million in 2010 compared to $192.1 million in 2009. The decrease was due to a combination of lower premiums earned, an increased mix of lower commission business and higher reinstatement premiums, which do not have corresponding commission expense. Segment other underwriting expenses increased to $26.4 million in 2010 compared to $24.6 million in 2009. The increase was primarily the result of expanded operations in Ireland. Commission and brokerage decreased 8.0% to $192.1 million in 2009 as compared to $208.9 million in 2008. The variance was principally the result of lower earned premiums and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses in 2009 increased slightly to $24.6 million compared to $24.2 million in 2008. 62 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions. Loss and LAE Reserves. Our most critical accounting policy is the determination of our loss and LAE reserves. We maintain reserves equal to our estimated ultimate liability for losses and LAE for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and LAE by underwriting or accident year, we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time, evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted. We consider many factors when setting reserves including: (1) our exposure base and projected ultimate premiums earned; (2) our expected loss rat ios by product and class of business, which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries; (3) actuarial methodologies which analyze our loss reporting and payment experience, reports from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) uncertainties discussed below regarding our liability for A&E claims. Our insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves. Our net income (loss) will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and LAE is recorded. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities. At December 31, 2010, we had reinsurance reserves of $7,072.2 million and insurance loss reserves of $2,268.0 million, of which $446.3 million and $108.5 million, respectively, were loss reserves for A&E liabilities. A detailed discussion of additional considerations related to A&E exposures follows later in this section. The detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems. Reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies. Ceding companies report losses to us in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information is recorded into our records. For certain proportional contracts, we may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur. Our experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information. Based on our evaluation of a claim, we may establish additional case reserves (ACRs) in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company. To ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data, the Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of our ceding companies, particularly larger ceding companies, including on-site audits. We sort both our reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis. We assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses. We periodically review our exposure groupings and we may change our grouping over time as our business changes. We currently use over 200 exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates. One of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process. Business, in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly, are commonly referred to as short tail lines, principally property lines. 60;On the other hand, casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines. Our estimates of ultimate losses for shorter tail lines, with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events, generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines. 63 Table of Contents We use similar actuarial methodologies, such as expected loss ratio, chain ladder reserving methods and Borhuetter Ferguson, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, to estimate our ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Although we use similar actuarial methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines, the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines. As a result, we utilize, as well, exposure-based methods to estimate our ultimate losses for longer tail lines, especially for immature accident years. For both short and long tail lines, we supplement these general approaches with analytically based judgments. We cannot estimate losse from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, using traditional actuarial methods. We estimate losses for these types of events based on information derived from catastrophe models, quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses, reports and communications from ceding companies and development patterns for historically similar events. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these estimates are subject to variability, which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event. Our key actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor do we supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty. Our carried reserves at each reporting date are our best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and LAE at that date. We complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for our reinsurance and insurance operations. The completed annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed. Analyzing the roll-forward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study. We analyze significant variances between actual and expected losses and post adjustments to our reserves as warranted. Given the inherent variability in our loss reserves, we have developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels. A table of ranges by segment, accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability, is included in Financial Condition - Loss and LAE Reserves . The ranges are statistically developed using the exposure groups used in the reserve estimation process and aggregated to the segment level. For each exposure group, our actuaries calculate a range for each accident year based principally on two variables. The first is the historical changes in losses and LAE incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) for each accident year over time; the second is volatility of each accident year held reserves related to estimated ultimate losses, also over time. Both are measured at various ages from the end of the accident year through the final payout of the year losses. Ranges are developed for the exposure groups using statistical methods to adjust for diversification; the ranges for the exposure groups are aggregated to the segment level, likewise, with an adjustment for diversification. Our estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. Our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities and our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates. We calculate the ranges subsequently, based on the historical variability of such reserves. Asbestos and Environmental Exposures. We continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts asserting injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. Environmental claims typically assert liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. Asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. Our reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for A&E claims. Our A&E liabilities emanate from Mt. McKinley direct insurance business and Everest Re assumed reinsurance business. There are significant uncertainties surrounding our estimates of our potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance provider over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning 64 Table of Contents interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure. With respect to asbestos claims in particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating our liability. These developments include: (a) a changing mix of claim types represented in new filings, with the relative percentage of claims by individuals with no functional impairment first increasing then decreasing over the past several years; (b) the growth in the number of claims where coverage is sought under the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion; (c) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants, especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (d) the slow development of asbestos bankruptcy cases, as a result of which many of the critical legal issues arising in those cases ar e still unresolved at the appellate level; (e) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (f) legislation in some states to address asbestos litigation issues; and (g) the potential that other states or the U.S. Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that new claims filing rates have decreased, that new filings of asbestos-driven bankruptcies have decreased and that various procedural and legislative reforms are beginning to diminish the potential ultimate liability for asbestos losses. We believe that these uncertainties continue to render reserves for A&E, and particularly asbestos losses, significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves for other types of losses. We establish reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for us or our ceding companies. We have direct relationships with Mt. McKinley policyholders and we attempt to uphold our contractual rights and assert valid defenses to coverage where appropriate. The uncertainties inherent in asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigations have provided us the opportunity to engage in settlement negotiations with a number of policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities. Those discussions are aimed at achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that limit Mt. McKinley liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, we cannot be certain that this approach will lead to a negotiated settlement in the range expected by us in each or every instance. Between 2004 and 2010, we concluded settlements or reached agreement in principle with 22 of our high profile policyholders. We continue the approach of attempting to negotiate with such policyholders that may have significant asbestos liabilities, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where we and the policyholder have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. We believe that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley liabilities than a passive approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the developments in litigation, negotiations and, ultimately, potential settlements. There is little potential for similar settlements of our reinsurance asbestos claims where we have no direct relationships with the insureds. Our ceding companies have the direct obligation to insureds and are responsible for their own claim settlements. They are not consistently prompt in developing and providing claim settlement information to their reinsurers, which can introduce inconsistencies and significant delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers, including us. These delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also limit the available information from which reinsurers, including us, estimate their ultimate exposure. See the discussion below under the heading Financial Condition Loss and LAE Reserves .t> Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 65 Table of Contents Reinsurance Receivables. We have purchased reinsurance to reduce our exposure to adverse claim experience, large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. Our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances. Such reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders. In the event our reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts, we will not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance receivable balance. To minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables, we have a reinsurance security committee tha t evaluates the financial strength of each reinsurer prior to our entering into a reinsurance arrangement. In some cases, we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable, including letters of credit, trust assets and cash. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. We have established reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectability of the outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the reserve for uncollectible balances was $21.6 million and $51.6 million, respectively. The decline in reserve for uncollectible reinsurance was primarily due to a $30.0 million write-off of a reinsurance receivable balance with a corresponding reduction in the provision of uncollectible reinsurance. This write-off of the reinsurance receivable had no impact upon 2010 net income as the reserve for uncollectibility had been fully estab lished in previous periods. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income (loss) in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Condition Reinsurance Receivables below. Premiums Written and Earned. Premiums written by us are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts. We establish unearned premium reserves to cover the unexpired portion of each contract. Such reserves are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data received from ceding companies. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to us, are estimated and accrued. Because of the inherent lag in the reporting of written and earned premiums by our ceding companies, we use standard accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned premiums to comprise our total premiums earned for determination of our incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium are included in current period company and segment financial results. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table displays the estimated components of earned but not reported premiums by segment for the periods indicated. At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 U.S. Reinsurance $ 286.5 $ 308.4 $ 289.2 U.S. Insurance 2.2 12.1 13.9 Specialty Underwriting 53.9 64.9 82.2 International 195.2 216.7 181.0 Bermuda 204.7 187.3 185.1 Total $ 742.5 $ 789.5 $ 751.3 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Investment Valuation. Our fixed income investments are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale and are carried at market value or fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our equity securities are also held as available for sale and are carried at market or fair value. Most securities we own are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. Some of our commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) are valued using cash flow models and risk-adjusted discount rates. We hold some privately placed securities, less than 0.05% of the portfolio, that are either valued by brokers or an investment advisor. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our investmen t portfolio included $567.9 million and $504.3 million, respectively, of limited partnership investments whose values are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting. We carry these investments at values provided by the managements of the 66 Table of Contents limited partnerships and due to inherent reporting lags, the carrying values are based on values with as of dates from one month to one quarter prior to our financial statement date. At December 31, 2010, we had net unrealized gains, net of tax, of $369.4 million compared to $309.3 million at December 31, 2009. Gains and losses from market fluctuations for investments held at market value are reflected as comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses from market fluctuations for investments held at fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with FASB guidance. Market value declines for the fixed income portfolio, which are considered credit other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), as realized capital losses. We consider many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other-than-temporary, including: (1) we have no intent to sell and, more likely than not, will not be required to sell prior to recovery, (2) the length of time the market value has been below book value, (3) the credit strength of the issuer, (4) the issuer market sector, (5) the length of time to maturity and (6) for asset-backed securities, changes in prepayments, credit enhancements and underlying default rates. If management assessments change in the future, we may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary. See also ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash and Invested Assets. Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $15,365.0 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $446.2 million compared to $14,918.8 million at December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily the result of $918.5 million of cash flows from operations, $73.1 million in equity adjustments of our limited partnership investments, $70.4 million in fair value re-measurements, $50.0 million revolving credit borrowings and $48.4 million of unrealized appreciation, partially offset by $398.6 million paid for share repurchases, $200.0 million payoff of debt maturity, $108.5 million paid out in dividends to shareholders and $17.4 million due to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Our principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our investment portfolio as having two components: 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities (our core fixed maturities portfolio) and 2) investments funded by our shareholders equity. For the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities, we generally invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa2, as rated by Moody s. For the U.S. portion of this portfolio, our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected U.S. operating results, market conditions and our tax position. This global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by us. Over the past few years and particularly in 2010, we have expanded the allocation of our investments funded by shareholders equity to include: 1) a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities, 2) emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures, 3) high yield fixed maturities, 4) bank loan securities and 5) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes, which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates. We limit our allocation to these asset classes because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these i nvestments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. We use investment managers experienced in these markets and adjust our allocation to these investments based upon market conditions. At December 31, 2010, the market value of investments in these investment market sectors, carried at both market and fair value, approximated 36% of shareholders equity. 67 Table of Contents The Company limited partnership investments are comprised of limited partnerships that invest in public equities and limited partnerships that invest in private equities. Generally, the public equity limited partnerships are reported on a one month lag while the private equity partnerships are included in the financials on a quarter lag. All of the limited partnerships are required to report using fair value accounting in accordance with FASB guidance. We receive annual audited financial statements for all of the limited partnerships. For the quarterly reports, the Company staff performs reviews of the financial reports for any unusual changes in carrying value. If the Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value during the lag reporting period, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline. The tables below summarize the composition and characteristics of our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated.

The pre-tax equivalent return adjusts the yield on tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent. Reinsurance Receivables. Reinsurance receivables for both paid and recoverable on unpaid losses totaled $684.7 million and $636.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, $171.7 million, or 25.1%, was receivable from C.V. Starr; $105.0 million, or 15.3% was receivable from Transatlantic; $100.0 million, or 14.6%, was receivable from Continental; $48.9 million, or 7.1%, was receivable from Munich Re and $45.0 million, or 6.6%, was receivable from Berkley. The receivable from C.V. Starr is fully collateralized by a trust agreement. The receivable from Continental is collateralized by a funds held arrangement under which we have retained the premiums earned by the retrocessionaire to secure obligat ions of the retrocessionaire, recorded them as a liability, credited interest on the balances at a stated contractual rate and reduced the liability account as payments became due. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of our receivables. 68 Table of Contents Loss and LAE Reserves. Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $9,340.2 million at December 31, 2010 and $8,937.9 million at December 31, 2009. The following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, classified by case reserves and IBNR reserves, for the periods indicated. At December 31, 2010 Case IBNR Total % of (Dollars in millions) Reserves Reserves Reserves Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,293.3 $ 1,672.7 $ 2,966.0 31.8 % U.S. Insurance 859.6 1,142.0 2,001.6 21.4 % Specialty Underwriting 237.1 193.8 430.9 4.6 % International 945.8 711.6 1,657.4 17.7 % Bermuda 788.2 941.3 1,729.5 18.5 % Total excluding A&E 4,123.9 4,661.5 8,785.4 94.1 % A&E 290.4 264.4 554.8 5.9 % Total including A&E $ 4,414.4 $ 4,925.8 $ 9,340.2 100.0 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)

Changes in premiums earned and business mix, reserve re-estimations, catastrophe losses and changes in catastrophe loss reserves and claim settlement activity all impact loss and LAE reserves by segment and in total. Our loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We continuously re-evaluate our reserves, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. Changes in reserves resulting from such re-evaluations are reflected in incurred losses in the period when the re-evaluation is made. Our analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. In order to set appropriate reserves, we make qualitative and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels. 60;Additionally, the attribution of reserves, changes in reserves and incurred losses among accident years requires qualitative and quantitative adjustments and allocations at these various levels. We utilize actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to ensure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices. Nevertheless, our reserves are estimates, which are subject to variation, which may be significant. There can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future, possibly by a material amount. However, we believe that our existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context, we note that over the past 10 years, our calendar year operations have been affected by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, ranging from a favorable $30.9 million in 2010, representing 0.4% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million in 2004, representing 3.7% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. 69 Table of Contents We have included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries, which have been developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. Our presentation of this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. Our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point estimates for approximately 200 reserve groups and reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities. Our actuarial methodologies develop point estimates rather than ranges and the ranges are developed subsequently based upon historical and prospective variability measures. The following table below represents the reserve levels and ranges for each of our business segments for the period indicated. Outstanding Reserves and Ranges By Segment (1) At December 31, 2010 As Low Low High High (Dollars in millions) Reported Range % (2) Range (2) Range % (2) Range (2) Gross Reserves By Segment U.S. Reinsurance $ 2,966.0 -13.6 % $ 2,561.3 13.6 % $ 3,370.8 U.S. Insurance 2,001.6 -20.1 % 1,600.1 20.1 % 2,402.9 Specialty Underwriting 430.9 -14.9 % 366.7 14.9 % 495.0 International 1,657.4 -10.6 % 1,481.1 10.6 % 1,833.7 Bermuda 1,729.5 -8.5 % 1,583.4 8.5 % 1,875.7 Total Gross Reserves (excluding A&E) 8,785.4 -9.9 % 7,915.3 9.9 % 9,655.5 A&E (All Segments) 554.8 -13.7 % 478.8 13.7 % 630.8 Total Gross Reserves $ 9,340.2 -9.7 % 8,431.0 9.7 % 10,249.3 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) _______________________________________ (1) There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges requiring additional income (loss) statement expense. (2) Although totals are displayed for both the low and high range amounts, it should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments. Depending on the specific segment, the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges from minus 8.5% to minus 20.1% for the low range and from plus 8.5% to plus 20.1% for the high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the U.S. Insurance segment. The size of the range is dependent upon the level of confidence associated with the outcome. Within each range, our best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimate derived by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. For the above presentation, we have assumed what we believe is a reasonable confidence level but note that there can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary outside of these ranges. Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have exposure to insured A&E losses through our Mt. McKinley operation and reinsured A&E losses and through Everest Re. In each case, our management and analyses of our exposures take into account a number of features of our business that differentiate our exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures. Mt. McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the volume of its writings in 1978. These writings ceased in 1984, giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure, which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on the product liability coverage. Policies issued in earlier decades were generally more likely to lack aggregate limits. 70 Table of Contents The vast majority of Mt. McKinley A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with aggregate coverage limits. Mt. McKinley attachment points vary but generally are excess of millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of most of Mt. McKinley policies also offers insulation against non-product claims (for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate since each non-product claim is a separate loss; whereas for product claims, all claims related to a given product a ggregate as one loss. Environmental claims arise under general liability coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies. Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures beginning in 1984 through contract exclusions. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many long established reinsurance companies. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re mainly wrote property business, which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience indicates that the majority of its exposure was on excess policies, similar to those directly written by Mt. McKinley. Asbestos and Environmental Exposures. A&E exposures represent a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve adequacy. The following table summarizes incurred losses and outstanding loss reserves with respect to A&E reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods indicated. At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 638.7 $ 786.8 $ 922.8 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 19.6 53.4 130.7 Change in IBNR (19.6 ) (53.4 ) (130.7 ) Total incurred losses and LAE - - - Paid losses (83.9 ) (148.2 ) (136.0 ) End of period reserves $ 554.8 $ 638.7 $ 786.8 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 613.1 $ 749.1 $ 827.4 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 19.3 64.4 120.0 Change in IBNR (19.3 ) (63.9 ) (120.0 ) Total incurred losses and LAE - 0.4 - Paid losses (80.2 ) (136.4 ) (78.3 ) End of period reserves $ 532.9 $ 613.1 $ 749.1 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) At December 31, 2010, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $135.4 million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $116.1 million representing additional case reserves established by us on assumed reinsurance claims, $38.9 million representing case reserves established by us on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley, and $264.4 million representing IBNR reserves. With respect to asbestos only, at December 31, 2010, we had gross asbestos loss reserves of $530.4 million, or 95.6%, of total A&E reserves, of which $426.2 million was for assumed business and $104.2 million was for direct business. 71 Table of Contents The following tables summarize reserve and claim activity on a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis for our reinsurance and direct asbestos exposures. Asbestos - Reinsurance At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 477.9 $ 533.2 $ 585.3 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 16.8 45.4 71.3 Change in IBNR (16.8 ) (45.4 ) (71.3 ) Total incurred losses and LAE - - - Paid losses (51.8 ) (55.3 ) (52.2 ) End of period reserves $ 426.2 $ 477.9 $ 533.2 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 458.2 $ 508.2 $ 557.4 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 16.8 42.9 66.2 Change in IBNR (16.8 ) (43.0 ) (66.2 ) Total incurred losses and LAE - (0.1 ) - Paid losses (49.9 ) (49.9 ) (49.1 ) End of period reserves $ 408.3 $ 458.2 $ 508.2 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Asbestos - Direct At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 130.8 $ 200.9 $ 273.6 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 2.9 8.5 51.6 Change in IBNR (2.9 ) (8.5 ) (51.6 ) Total incurred losses and LAE - - - Paid losses (26.7 ) (70.1 ) (72.7 ) End of period reserves $ 104.2 $ 130.8 $ 200.9 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 123.1 $ 187.3 $ 205.9 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 2.6 7.5 46.6 Change in IBNR (2.6 ) (7.1 ) (46.6 ) Total incurred losses and LAE - 0.4 - Paid losses (25.1 ) (64.7 ) (18.6 ) End of period reserves $ 97.9 $ 123.1 $ 187.3 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Ultimate loss projections for A&E liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques. We believe that our A&E reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate liability; however, there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves, perhaps by a significant amount. Industry analysts use the survival ratio to compare the A&E reserves among companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company current net reserves by the three year average of annual paid losses. Hence, the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels. Using this measurement, our net three year asbestos survival ratio was 5.9 years at December 31, 2010. These metrics can be skewed by individual large settlements occurring in the prior three years and therefore, may not be indicative of the timing of future payments. 72 Table of Contents Because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and does not indicate absolute reserve adequacy, we consider, but do not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating our reserves. In particular, we note that year to year loss payment variability can be material. This is due, in part, to our orientation to negotiated settlements, particularly on our Mt. McKinley exposures, which significantly reduces the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2010, we made asbestos net claim payments of $22.2 million to Mt McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement had been reached. Such payments, which are non-repetitive, distort downward our three year survival ratio for 2010 and will continue to d o so for 2011 and 2012. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing that total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, we consider that our adjusted asbestos survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 8.7 years, which is better than prevailing industry norms. Shareholders Equity. Our shareholders equity increased to $6,283.5 million as of December 31, 2010 from $6,101.7 million as of December 31, 2009. This increase was the result of $610.8 million in net income, unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax, of $60.2 million, share-based compensation transactions of $17.8 million and $1.9 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by repurchasing 5.1 million common shares for $398.6 million, $108.5 million of shareholder dividends and $1.8 million of benefit plan obligation adjustments. Our shareholders equity increased to $6,101.7 million as of December 31, 2009 from $4,960.4 million as of December 31, 2008. This increase was the result of $807.0 million in net income, unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax, of $529.9 million, $83.8 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and $22.5 million of share-based compensation transactions, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.4 common shares for $190.6 million and $116.9 million of shareholder dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital. Our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength and financial strength ratings, and the market perception of our financial strength, as measured by shareholders equity, which was $6,283.5 million at December 31, 2010 and $6,101.7 million at December 31, 2009. On March 13, 2009, Everest Re and Everest National, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company, received notification of a one level ratings downgrade by Standard & Poor s. On April 7, 2010, Standard & Poor upgraded the Company debt ratings one level. We continue to possess significant financial flexibility and access to the debt and equity markets as a result of our perceived financia l strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies. From time to time, we have used open market share repurchases to adjust our capital position and enhance long term expected returns to our shareholders. On July 21, 2008, our existing authorization to purchase up to 5 million of our shares was amended to authorize the purchase of up to 10 million shares. On February 24, 2010, our existing authorization to purchase up to 10 million of our shares was amended to authorize the purchase of up to 15 million shares. As of December 31, 2010, we had repurchased 11.6 million shares under this authorization. On December 17, 2008, we renewed our shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), as a Well Known Seasoned Issuer. This shelf registration statement can be used by Group to register common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants, share purchase contracts and share purchase units; by Holdings to register debt securities and by Everest Re Capital Trust III ( Capital Trust III ) to register trust preferred securities. Liquidity. Our principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our investment portfolio as having two components: 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities (our core fixed maturities portfolio) and 2) investments funded by our shareholders equity. 73 Table of Contents For the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities, we generally invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa2, as rated by Moody s. For the U.S. portion of this portfolio, our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected U.S. operating results, market conditions and our tax position. This global fixed maturity securities portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by us. Over the past few years and particularly in 2010, we have expanded the allocation of our investments funded by shareholders equity to include: 1) a greater percentage of publicly traded equity securities, 2) emerging market fixed maturities through mutual fund structures, 3) high yield fixed maturities, 4) bank loan securities and 5) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes, which are also less subject to changes in value with movements in interest rates. We limit our allocation to these asset classes because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these i nvestments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. We use investment managers experienced in these markets and adjust our allocation to these investments based upon market conditions. At December 31, 2010, the market value of investments in these investment market sectors, carried at both market and fair value, approximated 36% of shareholders equity. Our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. Our net cash flows from operating activities were $918.5 million, $784.7 million and $663.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows reflected a net tax refund of $31.0 million and net tax payments of $111.8 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; net catastrophe loss payments of $410.8 million, $235.3 million and $290.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; and net A&E payments of $80.2 million, $136.4 million and $78.3 million for years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. If disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows, cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from insurance operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash inflows from investment maturities and dispositions, both short-term investments and longer term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows. As the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held cash and short-term investments of $1,043.7 million and $920.7 million, respectively. All of our short-term investments are readily marketable and can be converted to cash. In addition to these cash and short-term investments, at December 31, 2010, we had $580.5 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $4,057.2 million maturing within one to five years and $5,088.2 million maturing after five years. Our $1,085.2 million of equity securities are compris ed primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily liquidated. We believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future. We do not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but have the ability to do so. Sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses. At December 31, 2010 we had $439.6 million of net pre-tax unrealized appreciation, comprised of $555.5 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation and $115.9 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation. 74 Table of Contents Management expects annual positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing, to persist over the near term, absent any unusual catastrophe activity. In the intermediate and long term, our cash flow from operations will be impacted to the extent by which competitive pressures affect overall pricing in our markets and by which our premium receipts are impacted from our strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability over premium volume. Effective July 27, 2007, Group, Bermuda Re and Everest International entered into a five year, $850.0 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders referred to as the Group Credit Facility . Wachovia Bank, a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Corporation ( Wachovia Bank ) is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility, which consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $350.0 million of unsecured revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of unsecured standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the Company option, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin. The Base Rate is th e higher of (a) the prime commercial lending rate established by Wachovia Bank or (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depends on Group senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis. The Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of $3,575.4 million plus 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group fiscal quarters, for which statements are available ending on or after January 1, 2007 and for which consolidated net income is positive, plus 25% of any increase in consolidated net worth during such period attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares, which at December 31, 2010, was $4,226.2 million. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all Group Credit Facility covenants. At December 31, 2010, the Group Credit Facility had no outstanding letters of credit under tranche one and $406.4 million outstanding letters of credit under tranche two. At December 31, 2009, the Group Credit Facility had no outstanding letters of credit under tranche one and $386.5 million outstanding letters of credit under tranche two. Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings entered into a five year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders referred to as the Holdings Credit Facility . Citibank N.A. is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility may be used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating interest rate per annum in effect from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank as its prime rate or (b) 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings senior unsecured debt rating. The Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Reinsurance Company ( Everest Re ) to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.5 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2005, which at December 31, 2010, was $1,989.4 million . As of December 31, 2010, Holdings was in compliance with all Holdings Credit Facility covenants. At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding $50.0 million of short-term borrowings from the Holdings Credit Facility revolving credit line, with a maturity date of January 18, 2011. These short-term borrowings can be paid either through renewal with a one, two, three or six month term; or out of cash flows from operations. The highest amount outstanding in short-term borrowings was $133.0 million for the period from June 15, 2010 to August 9, 2010. In addition, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Holdings Credit Facility had outstanding letters of credit of $9.5 million and $28.0 million, respectively. 75 Table of Contents Costs incurred in connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $1.8 million and $1.5 million for December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Exposure to Catastrophes. Like other insurance and reinsurance companies, we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates and across lines of business. We focus on potential losses that could result from any single event, or series of events as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas. These techniques range from deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying reasonable damage factors, to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis. No single universal model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for our licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units. Also, while most models have been updated to incorporate claim information from recent catastrophic events, catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise. In addition, uncertainties with respect to future cli matic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity data. Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events. Projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the PML. We define PML as our anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The PML will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the make-up of the in force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods , such as 100-year events and 250-year events . For example, a 100-year PML is the estimated loss to the current in-force portfolio from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period. In other words, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the los from a single event will fall below the indicated PML. It is important to note that PMLs are estimates. Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a result, there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. From an enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure we may underwrite. The limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to our financial resources and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses of the business being underwritten. Management estimates that the projected economic loss from its largest 100-year event in a given zone represents approximately 10% of its projected 2011 shareholders equity. Economic loss is the gross PML reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate reinsurance. Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year 76 Table of Contents return periods. This process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management decisions. Our catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. We believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane affecting the U.S. southeast coast, where we estimate we have a gross PML exposure of $941 million. See also table under ITEM 1, Business - Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements . If such a single catastrophe loss were to occur, management estimates that the economic loss to us would be approximately $640 million. The estimate involves multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded. We may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations. Reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting our view of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance. For the period from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2011, we have catastrophe loss reinsurance in place of 75% of $100 million in excess of $250 million, excluding the territories of the U.S., Japan, Europe and Caribbean wind. See ITEM 1, Business - Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements for further details. Contractual Obligations. The following table shows our contractual obligations for the period indicated. Payments due by period Less than More than (Dollars in millions) Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years 5.40% Senior notes $ 249.8 $ - $ - $ 249.8 $ - Junior subordinated debt 329.9 - - - 329.9 6.6% Long term notes 238.4 - - - 238.4 Interest expense (1) 1,410.0 49.1 98.2 84.7 1,178.0 Employee benefit plans 41.6 2.9 7.6 8.0 23.1 Operating lease agreements 88.1 7.9 20.9 17.3 41.9 Gross reserve for losses and LAE (2) 9,340.2 2,198.8 3,507.8 1,121.3 2,512.3 Total $ 11,697.9 $ 2,258.7 $ 3,634.5 $ 1,481.1 $ 4,323.6 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) ________________________ (1) Interest expense on 6.6% long term notes is assumed to be fixed through contractual term. (2) Loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of losses from claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash flows uncertain. Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ from our estimates. The contractual obligations for senior notes, long term notes and junior subordinated debt are the responsibility of Holdings. We have sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations. Holdings generally depends upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary for its funding, capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets. Our various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that we, and each of our entities, have sufficient financial resources or ready access thereto, to meet all obligations. 77 Table of Contents On March 15, 2010, Holdings $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes matured and was paid in cash. Dividends. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we declared and paid shareholder dividends of $108.5 million, $116.9 million and $118.6 million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, we are partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings Ireland is subject to Irish corporate and regulatory restrictions; the payment of dividends to Holdings Ireland by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions; and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest Re ability to declare and pa y dividends sufficient to support Holdings general corporate needs and that Holdings Ireland and Bermuda Re will have the ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group general corporate needs. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $590.0 million, $60.0 million and $285.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $215.0 million, $245.0 million and $120.0 million, respectively. See ITEM 1, Business Regulatory Matters Dividends and ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of Recently Issued Accounting Guidance. Financial Accounting Standards Board Launched Accounting Codification. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing the FASB Accounting Standards Codification TM ( Codification ) as the single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification will become non-authoritative. Following the Codification, the FASB will no longer issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, the FASB will issue Accounting Standards Updates, which will serve to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to the Codification. GAAP is not intended to be changed as a result of the FASB Codification, but it will change the way the guidance is organized and presented. As a result, these changes will have a significant impact on how companies reference GAAP in their financial statements and in the accounting policies for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company adoption of this guidance impacts the way the Company references U.S. GAAP accounting standards in the financial statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Treatment of Insurance Contract Acquisition Costs. In October 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The guidance identifies the incremental direct costs of contract acquisition and costs directly related to acquisition activities that should be capitalized. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will adopt this guidance prospectively, as of January 1, 2012. Subsequent Events. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for subsequent events, which was later modified in February 2010, that addresses the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events not addressed in other applicable U.S. GAAP. The Company implemented the new disclosure requirement beginning with the second quarter of 2009 and included it in the Notes to Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. 78 Table of Contents Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements. In January 2010, the FASB amended the authoritative guidance for disclosures on fair value measurements. Effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, the guidance requires a new separate disclosure for: significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 and the reasons for the transfers; and provided clarification on existing disclosures to include: fair value measurement disclosures by class of assets and liabilities and disclosure on valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value that fall in either Level 2 or Level 3. The Company implemented this guidance effective January 1, 2010. Effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010, the guidance requires another new separate disclosure in regards to Level 3 fair value measurements in that, the period activity will present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. Comparative disclosures shall be required only for periods ending after initial adoption. The Company implemented this guidance beginning with the third quarter of 2010. Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments. In April 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for disclosures about fair value of financial instruments. This new guidance requires quarterly disclosures on the qualitative and quantitative information about the fair value of all financial instruments including methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value during the period. These disclosures were previously only done annually. The Company adopted this disclosure beginning with the second quarter of 2009 and included it in the Notes to Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Investment Securities. In April 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. This new guidance amends the recognition guidance for other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities and expands the financial statement disclosures for other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities. For available for sale debt securities that the Company has no intent to sell and more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to recovery, only the credit loss component of the impairment would be recognized in earnings, while the rest of the fair value loss would be recognized in accumulated ot her comprehensive income. The Company adopted this guidance effective April 1, 2009. Upon adoption the Company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment increase in retained earnings and decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $57.3 million, net of $8.3 million of tax. Measurement of Fair Value in Inactive Markets. In April 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which reaffirms that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. It also reaffirms the need to use judgment in determining if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has become inactive. There was no impact to the Company financial statements upon adoption. Fair Value Disclosures about Pension Plan Assets. In December 2008, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for employers disclosures about pension plan assets. This new guidance requires additional disclosures about the components of plan assets, investment strategies for plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The Company, in conjunction with fair value measurement of plan assets, separated plan assets into the three fair value hierarchy levels and provided a roll forward of the changes in fair value of plan assets classified as Level 3 in the 2009 annual consolidated financial statements. These disclosures had no effect on the Company accounting for plan benefits and obligations. Revisions to Earnings per Share Calculation. In June 2008, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for earnings per share for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This new guidance requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends be considered as a separate class of common stock and included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. The Company restricted share awards meet this definition and are therefore included in the basic earnings per share calculation. 79 Table of Contents Additional Disclosures for Derivative Instruments. In March 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which requires enhanced disclosures on derivative instruments and hedged items. On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the additional disclosure for the equity index put options. No comparative information for periods prior to the effective date was required. This guidance had no impact on how the Company records its derivatives. Market Sensitive Instruments. The SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). We do not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. Our current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position. The fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, we have invested in equity securities. We have also written a small number of equity index put option contracts. The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period. Interest Rate Risk. Our $15.4 billion investment portfolio, at December 31, 2010, is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk, and some equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk. The impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio, including short-term investments, from a change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $2,506.2 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $12,631.0 million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security. 80 Table of Contents The tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including $785.3 million of short-term investments) for the period indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securit ies was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios . Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At December 31, 2010 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Market/Fair Value $ 14,348.4 $ 13,902.3 $ 13,416.2 $ 12,892.7 $ 12,371.5 Market/Fair Value Change from Base (%) 6.9 % 3.6 % 0.0 % -3.9 % -7.8 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 745.7 $ 388.4 $ - $ (420.3 ) $ (841.8 ) Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points At December 31, 2009 -200 -100 0 100 200 (Dollars in millions) Total Market/Fair Value $ 14,804.7 $ 14,296.2 $ 13,729.6 $ 13,120.0 $ 12,520.6 Market/Fair Value Change from Base (%) 7.8 % 4.1 % 0.0 % -4.4 % -8.8 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 826.1 $ 434.7 $ - $ (468.4 ) $ (932.0 ) We had $9,340.2 million and $8,937.9 million of gross reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to present value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the present value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the present value increases. These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments. While the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. Our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 3.8 years, which is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio. If we were to discount our loss and LAE reserves, net of $0.7 billion of reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses, the discount would be approximately $1.4 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately $7.3 billion, representing approximately 54.3% of the market value of the fixed maturity investment portfolio funds. Equity Risk. Equity risk is the potential change in fair and/or market value of the common stock, preferred stock and mutual fund portfolios arising from changing prices. Our equity investments consist of a diversified portfolio of individual securities and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and preferred stocks, that are traded on the major exchanges, and mutual fund investments in emerging market debt. The primary objective of the equity portfolio is to obtain greater total return relative to our core bonds over time through market appreciation and income. 81 Table of Contents The tables below display the impact on fair/market value and after-tax change in fair/market value of a 10% and 20% change in equity prices up and down for the period indicated. Impact of Percentage Change in Equity Fair/Market Values At December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) -20 % -10 % 0 % 10 % 20 % Fair/Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 868.1 $ 976.7 $ 1,085.2 $ 1,193.7 $ 1,302.2 After-tax Change in Fair/Market Value $ (165.7 ) $ (82.8 ) $ - $ 82.8 $ 165.7 Impact of Percentage Change in Equity Fair/Market Values At December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) -20 % -10 % 0 % 10 % 20 % Fair/Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 317.1 $ 356.7 $ 396.3 $ 436.0 $ 475.6 After-tax Change in Fair/Market Value $ (51.8 ) $ (25.9 ) $ - $ 25.9 $ 51.8 Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of our non-U.S./Bermuda ( foreign ) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the E uro. We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with FASB guidance, we translate the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2010 there has been no material change in exposure to foreign exchange rates as compared to December, 31, 2009. The tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure for the periods indicated. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent At December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions) -20 % -10 % 0 % 10 % 20 % Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (90.1 ) $ (59.8 ) $ - $ 81.2 $ 178.3 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent At December 31, 2009 (Dollars in millions) -20 % -10 % 0 % 10 % 20 % Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (122.1 ) $ (75.6 ) $ - $ 96.6 $ 209.1 Equity Index Put Option Contracts. Although not considered material in the context of our aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, we have issued six equity index put option contracts based on the Standard & Poor 500 ( S&P 500 ) index and one equity index put option contract based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure. We sold six equity index put option contracts, based on the S&P 500 index, for total consideration, net of commissions, of $22.5 million. At December 31, 2010, fair value for these equity index put option contracts was $52.4 million. These equity index put option contracts each have a single exercise date, with maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. The S&P 500 index value at December 31, 2010 was $1,257.64. No amounts will be payable under these equity index put option contracts if the S&P 500 index is at, or above, the strike prices on the exercise dates, which fall 82 Table of Contents between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due would vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2010 S&P 500 index value, we estimate the probability that each equity index put option contract of the S&P 500 index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 37%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the equity index put option contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. At December 31, 2010, the present value of these theoretical maximu m payouts using a 6% discount factor was $269.2 million. We sold one equity index put option contract based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7 million. At December 31, 2010, fair value for this equity index put option contract was $6.0 million. This equity index put option contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of 5,989.75. The FTSE 100 index value at December 31, 2010 was 5,899.90. No amount will be payable under this equity index put option contract if the FTSE 100 index is at, or above, the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the strike price on the exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the in dex is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2010 FTSE 100 index value, we estimate the probability that the equity index put option contract of the FTSE 100 index will fall below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 33%. The theoretical maximum payout under the equity index put option contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. At December 31, 2010, the present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6% discount factor and current exchange rate was $29.1 million. Because the equity index put option contracts meet the definition of a derivative, we report the fair value of these instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a liability and record any changes to fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a net derivative gain (loss). Our financial statements reflect fair values for our obligations on these equity index put option contracts at December 31, 2010, of $58.5 million and at December 31, 2009, of $57.3 million; even though it may not be likely that the ultimate settlement of these transactions would require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received , or any payment at all. As there is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return. The tables below display the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the equity indices, which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value for the period indicated.
