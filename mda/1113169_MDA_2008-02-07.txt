Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GENERAL. Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios. Investment advisory clients outside the United States account for 9% of our assets under management at December 31, 2007. We manage a broad range of U.S. and international stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations. The implosion of the subprime mortgage market in 2007 had a major impact on the financial markets. Defaults and delinquencies rose in the early part of the year and, by the summer, major Wall Street firms and commercial banks with exposure to subprime mortgages were reporting substantial losses. Liquidity in the asset-backed commercial paper market evaporated in August because fears of additional losses discouraged banks from lending to each other. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates by 50 basis points in September, the first reduction since June 2003, and signaled its continuing readiness to inject additional reserves into the U.S. banking system to boost liquidity and dampen the impact of market disruptions on the economy. Two more 25 basis point reductions in the fourth quarter reduced the target rate to 4.25% at year-end 2007. Concerns about generally slower corporate profit growth and rising energy and materials prices also weighed on the stock markets in 2007, and the leveraged buyout market slowed significantly in the second half of the year with several announced deals not closing due to tighter lending conditions. In this environment, U.S. equities produced mixed returns for 2007, with the broad S&P 500 Index of large-cap companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy reaching a new high as late as mid-July. Market volatility, however, was extremely high in the last six months of the year and, in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 Index suffered its first correction a drop of 10% or more in about five years. For the year, the S&P 500 Index returned 5.5%. The NASDAQ Composite Index, which is heavily weighted with technology companies that fared better than many other sectors in 2007, rose 9.8% (excluding dividends). Stocks outside the United States fared better than their U.S. counterparts in 2007. Emerging markets, led by equities in Latin America, substantially outperformed other foreign stocks. Developed European markets produced solid gains, but Japanese shares declined. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 39.8% during 2007 while the MSCI EAFE Index, which measures the performance of mostly large-cap stocks in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East, returned 11.6% during the year. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries was 4.04% at the end of 2007, down 67 basis points from 4.71% at the end of 2006. With the Federal Reserve rate reductions, U.S. Treasury bonds produced strong returns in 2007, as investors sought a safer haven away from the volatility of the equity and corporate debt markets in these highest quality fixed-income securities. Investment-grade corporate bonds also performed well as prices rose and yields declined. While 2007 was a reasonable year overall for the global financial markets, equities around the world declined dramatically in the early weeks of January 2008. Weaker-than-expected economic data, particularly on U.S. employment and retail spending, and the restraining effect of bank capital write-downs on credit availability combined to raise the downside risk in the near-term economic outlook. This risk may be mitigated to some extent by a forceful further easing of U.S. monetary policy that, over nine days, reduced the federal funds rate by 125 basis points to 3.0% as of January 30, and an expected fiscal stimulus package from the U.S. Congress and President. As always, we caution investors to be patient as the market goes through a period of transition and adjustment, and to have modest market return expectations and an awareness of risk and uncertainty. In the unsettled financial environment of 2007, total assets under our management ended the year at a record $400.0 billion, up $65.3 billion or 19.5% during 2007. Over the last three years, our assets under management (in billions) have increased as follows: 2005 2006 2007 Assets under management at beginning of year $ 235.2 $ 269.5 $ 334.7 Net cash inflows Sponsored mutual funds in the U.S., including $.4 billion in 2005 and $.8 billion in 2006 from mutual fund mergers 12.5 12.9 20.2 Other portfolios, including $.1 billion in separate accounts acquired in 2006 3.6 14.9 13.6 16.1 27.8 33.8 Net market appreciation and income 18.7 37.9 32.4 Net distributions from, but not reinvested in, sponsored mutual funds in the U.S. (.5 ) (.5 ) (.9 ) Increase during year 34.3 65.2 65.3 Assets under management at end of year $ 269.5 $ 334.7 $ 400.0 - 15 - During the last three years, our assets under management have increased across each of our four distribution channels. The largest increases were sourced from third-party financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world. Our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness have contributed significantly to attracting investor net inflows. Assets under management at December 31, 2007, include $321.6 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and $78.4 billion in fixed income investment portfolios. The investment portfolios that we manage consist of $246.0 billion in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States and $154.0 billion in other investment portfolios, including separately managed accounts, sub-advised funds, and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and through variable annuity life insurance plans. We incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts involve costs that generally precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 2007 versus 2006 . Investment advisory revenues were up 25%, or $370.6 million, to nearly $1.9 billion as average assets under our management increased $74.5 billion to $374.2 billion. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 50.2 basis points during 2007, virtually unchanged from the 50.3 basis points earned during 2006. Net revenues increased 23%, or $413.3 million, to $2.2 billion. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion in 2007, up 20% or $203.8 million from 2006. Overall, net operating income for 2007 increased $209.5 million, or almost 27%, to $996.4 million. Our operating margin was 44.7% in 2007, up from 43.4% in 2006. Net income increased $141.0 million, or almost 27%, to $670.6 million for 2007, boosting diluted earnings per share more than 26% from $1.90 to $2.40. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States increased 24%, or $260.2 million, to more than $1.3 billion. Average mutual fund assets were $232.8 billion in 2007, an increase of 24% over the average for 2006. Mutual fund assets increased $39.5 billion during 2007. Net inflows to the mutual funds were $20.2 billion during 2007. Our U.S. stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of $9.9 billion, our bond funds added $4.2 billion, our international and global stock funds added $4.7 billion, and our money market funds added $1.4 billion. Seven funds each added more than $1.4 billion and, in total, account for $15.6 billion of the net inflows. The Growth Stock Fund added more than $4.8 billion, the New Income and Equity Index 500 funds together added $4.6 billion, and the Blue Chip Growth, Value, Overseas Stock, and New Asia funds together attracted net inflows of $6.2 billion. Higher market valuations and income, net of dividends not reinvested, increased fund assets by $19.3 billion. Net fund inflows of $10.7 billion originated in our target-date Retirement Funds, which in turn invest in other T. Rowe Price funds. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $110.4 million, or almost 27%, to $525.8 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $141.4 billion in 2007, up 26% from the 2006 average. Other investment portfolio assets increased $25.8 billion during 2007, including more than $13.6 billion of net inflows from U.S. and international institutional investors and third-party financial intermediaries, and $12.2 billion from market gains and income. Administrative fees increased $42.7 million to $348.1 million. The change in these revenues includes $10.4 million from 12b-1 distribution fees recognized on greater assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares. The balance of the increase is primarily attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to distribute the Advisor and R class fund shares through third party financial intermediaries and to provide services to the funds and their investors. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, increased $138.8 million, or 21%, over 2006. The largest part of the increase is attributable to a $55.3 million increase in our annual bonus compensation, which is based on our operating results and considers our relative and risk-adjusted investment performance, our growth in assets under management and net investor inflows, and the high quality of our investor services. The 2007 costs also include an increase of $37.5 million in salaries, which results from a 9% increase in our average staff size coupled with an increase of our associates base salaries at the beginning of the year. At December 31, 2007, we employed 5,081 associates, up 10.3% from the beginning of 2007 and 4.3% from the 2007 average, primarily to handle increased volume-related activities and other growth. Other employee benefits and employment expenses, including an increase of $18.8 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, account for the remainder of the change in our compensation and related costs. Advertising and promotion expenditures increased $10.6 million from 2006 in response to greater investor interest. We expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in 2008 will be up about 15% versus 2007 and spending in the first quarter of 2008 to increase about $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2007. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the United States and abroad. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $16.5 million. We are expanding and renovating our facilities to accommodate additional associates to meet greater business demands. Other operating expenses were up $37.9 million, or 26%, including $10.4 million of higher distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries that distribute our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares. These distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b-1 fees discussed above. Additionally, consulting and professional fees, travel, information services, and other costs have risen this year to meet increased business demands. Our non-operating income, which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses, increased $9.0 million. Our larger mutual fund investments added $20.4 million in 2007, including $13.4 million of increased capital gain distributions from the funds. Additionally, 2006 included a gain of $12.2 million upon the liquidation of a sponsored collateralized bond obligation that did not recur. - 16 - The 2007 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income has been recognized using a rate of 37.7%, down slightly from the 38.3% rate for the year 2006, but in line with the estimate made at the beginning of the year. We currently estimate that our 2008 effective tax rate will increase by up to .5% due primarily to changes in state income tax rates and regulations. 2006 versus 2005 . Investment advisory revenues were up 22% to $1.5 billion as a result of a $52.6 billion increase in average assets under our management to $299.7 billion. Net revenues increased 20% or $.3 billion to $1.8 billion. Net operating income increased 20% to $787 million from $655 million. Net income increased 23% to nearly $530 million from $431 million in 2005. Diluted earnings per share increased 20% from $1.58 to $1.90. (All 2005 per-share information has been adjusted to retroactively reflect the two-for-one split of our common stock in June 2006.) On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment , and recognized $59.2 million of non-cash stock option-based compensation expense in 2006 using the fair value based method. Had we applied the fair value method in 2005, we would have recognized $59.8 million of additional stock option-based compensation expense. Our comparable pro forma diluted earnings for 2005 would then have been $1.43 per share and our 2006 diluted earnings per share of $1.90 would be 33% higher than 2005. See our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies accompanying our financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States increased 21%, or $.2 billion, to nearly $1.1 billion. Average mutual fund assets were $187.6 billion in 2006, 20% higher than the 2005 average of $156.2 billion. Mutual fund assets ended 2006 at $206.5 billion, 10% above the 2006 average. Net inflows to the mutual funds were $12.9 billion during 2006, including $6.6 billion that originated in our target-date Retirement Funds and $.8 billion from the merger of two fund groups into the Price funds. Our U.S. stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of $6.3 billion, while our international stock funds added $2.8 billion, and our bond and money market funds added $3.8 billion. The Growth Stock Fund added $4.2 billion of net investments this year while the Value Fund added more than $1.9 billion. Higher market valuations and income increased fund assets by $23.4 billion in 2006. Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased $80 million to $415 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $112.1 billion in 2006, up 23% or $21.2 billion from the 2005 average. Year-end assets totaled $128.2 billion, an increase of 14% from the 2006 average and up $28.9 billion from the start of the year. Net inflows from U.S. and international investors were $14.9 billion and market gains and income added $14.0 billion. In 2005, net inflows from sub-advised and separate account clients investing in U.S. securities were partially offset by significant net outflows from investors in some of our international investment portfolios. Administrative fees and other income increased $29 million to $305 million. The change in these revenues includes $5.2 million from 12b-1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares. The balance of the increase is primarily attributable to our servicing activities, including shareholder accounts and transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors. Operating expenses were $1.0 billion in 2006, up $171 million from 2005. Our largest expense, compensation and related costs, increased $136 million or 26%. The number of our associates, their total compensation, and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased. The most significant portion of the increase is attributable to the $59.2 million non-cash expense recognized for 2006 stock option-based compensation. The 2006 increase also reflects greater bonus compensation based on our strong operating results for 2006 as well as our strong relative and risk-adjusted investment performance, our growth in assets under management including new investor inflows, and the high quality of our investor services. Finally, we modestly increase our associates base salaries at the beginning of each year, and increased our average staff size by 5.4% versus 2005, primarily to handle increased volume-related activities and other growth. At December 31, 2006, we employed 4,605 associates. Advertising and promotion expenditures increased 13%, or $11.2 million, due to more favorable market conditions and investor interest in 2006. Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased $12.3 million. Our costs for rented office facilities, including increased space, and related equipment, maintenance and other costs increased along with our staff size and business needs. Other operating expenses were up $11.4 million versus 2005, including $5.2 million of higher distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries that distribute our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares. These distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b-1 fees discussed above. Other operating expenses, including travel costs and consulting and information services, rose to meet increased business demands. Overall, net operating income for 2006 increased 20% to $787 million and the operating margin was 43.4%, up .1% from 2005. Our net non-operating income, which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses and credit facility expenses, increased $47 million to $71 million. Larger money market mutual fund balances at higher interest rates added $20.5 million of the increase, the liquidation of a sponsored collateralized bond obligation in 2006 added $11.0 million, and gains on dispositions of mutual fund investments added $6.2 million. The 2006 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 38.3%, up from 36.6% in 2005. Our 2006 income tax provision includes provisions of .6%, or $4.8 million, for the anticipated settlement of prior years taxes, .3% for increased state taxes, and .3% for the effect of non-deductible incentive stock option-based compensation expense that we began recognizing in our 2006 operating results. The 2006 provision also does not include the .2% benefit that we recognized in 2005 for the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards. - 17 - CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. During 2007, stockholders equity increased from $2.4 billion to nearly $2.8 billion. Cash and investment holdings exceed $1.6 billion at December 31, 2007. Operating activities during 2007 provided cash flows of $758 million, up $165 million from 2006, including increased net income of $141 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $19 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $345 million, down nearly $77 million from 2006. Our investments in mutual funds and other securities made from our larger available cash balances was $214 million in 2007, down $112 million from 2006. Increased capital spending for property and equipment was $146 million in 2007, up $51 million versus 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was $401 million in 2007, up $199 million from 2006. We increased our expenditures for common stock repurchases by $141 million and our dividends paid to stockholders by $33 million. Operating activities during 2006 provided cash flows of $593 million, up $54 million from 2005, including increased net income of $99 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $58 million. Timing differences in the cash settlements of our assets and liabilities reduced comparative cash flows by $107 million. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $421 million, up $330 million from 2005. Our investments in mutual funds and other securities made from our larger available cash balances were $272 million more in 2006 than in 2005. Capital spending for property and equipment was $94 million in 2006, up $42 million versus 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $203 million in 2006, up $59 million from 2005. We increased our expenditures for common stock repurchases by $95 million and our dividends paid to stockholders by $28 million. Offsetting these outflows were nearly $66 million of tax benefits realized from option exercises and restricted stock vesting in 2006. Property and equipment expenditures in 2008, including those for the build-out of our expanded operating facilities, are anticipated to be nearly $200 million and are expected to be funded from cash balances. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2007. Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2008 and future years. The information also excludes the $4.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period that it might be paid to tax authorities. Total 2008 2009-10 2011-12 Later Noncancelable operating leases $ 224 $ 27 $ 47 $ 45 $ 105 Other purchase commitments 205 125 60 15 5 $ 429 $ 152 $ 107 $ 60 $ 110 We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional investments totaling $29.1 million at December 31, 2007. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in our statement of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes. We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2007 Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements. Other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities . We generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. We next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary. - 18 - A mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence, such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end, to overcome that presumption. We may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible. An impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income if we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security. Any determination of this type would consider the issuer financial condition and our ability and intent to hold the investment until its fair value recovers, which may mean until maturity, and to collect all contractual cash flows. Minor impairments of 5% or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary. Goodwill . We internally conduct, manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business. We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds our carrying amount (basically, our stockholders equity) and, therefore, that no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet, $665.7 million. Stock options . On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R and began recognizing stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using the fair value based method. Prior to 2006, our stock option grants were accounted for using the intrinsic value based method and no compensation expense related to our option grants was recognized in our consolidated statements of income. The recognition of stock option-based compensation expense had a material impact on our operating results in 2007 and 2006, and on comparability to our operating results in 2005 because we elected the modified prospective application of adopting SFAS 123R. The summary of significant accounting policies accompanying our consolidated financial statements includes comparable pro forma disclosures for 2005 as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize stock option-based compensation expense. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow. Provision for income taxes . After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior year adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined. NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. Each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted standards applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements. One such standard, SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , will add additional note disclosures to our 2008 financial statements about the valuation of our investments in sponsored mutual funds and debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary. Adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. - 19 - FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income, changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management, our expense levels, our estimated effective income tax rate, and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios; fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management; our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios; and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the United States and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the United States; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock option grants, stock awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems. Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general, or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments. - 20 -
