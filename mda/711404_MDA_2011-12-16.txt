Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. Outlook Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women healthcare markets. However, events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by employment, housing and credit concerns, the European debt crisis and the recent downgrade of long-term U.S. sovereign debt continue to represent a risk to our forecasted performance for fiscal year 2012 and beyond. We compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology and silicone hydrogel Aquaform technology. We believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we roll out new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets. Sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, a major product material in the industry, have grown significantly. In the past three years, CooperVision launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal lens products under our Biofinity brand and two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our Avaira brand. In fiscal 2011, we launched our Biofinity spherical silicone hydrogel lens in Japan and our Biofinity multifocal lens globally. While we believe that we have high quality silicone hydrogel contact lens products, our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel segment of the market. For example, competitive silicone hydrogel single-use and multifocal lens products are gaining market share and represent a risk to our business. We have not yet marketed a silicone hydrogel single-use product. Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability. In August 2011, CooperVision initiated a recall on limited lots of Avaira Toric contact lenses. In November 2011, this recall was expanded to cover limited lots of Avaira Sphere contact lenses. The recall was initiated because of the level of a residue (silicone oil) on certain lenses. The residue may cause hazy vision, severe eye pain or an eye injury. The manufacturing issue has been identified and process changes have been implemented. These process changes are subject to review by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere lenses that are subject to the 40 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) recall represent less than 2% of the Company fiscal 2011 net sales. Avaira Sphere lenses remain on the market, while Avaira Toric lenses are awaiting FDA authorization to return to the market. This recall is limited solely to specific lots of Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere contact lenses and no other CooperVision products are involved in this recall. We are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance CooperVision worldwide product lines. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and PC Technology materials and new lens designs, including multifocal and single-use silicone hydrogel lenses. The medical device segment of the women healthcare market is highly fragmented. CooperSurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model. In fiscal 2011, CooperSurgical acquired Apple Medical, gaining its products including the OB/Mobius Elastic Retractor used in cesarean sections, the Fischer Cone Biopsy Excisor used for cervical biopsies and the Apple-Hunt Secondary Trocar used in laparoscopic surgical procedures. CooperSurgical also acquired Summit Doppler Systems, Inc., gaining its hand-held obstetrical and vascular ultrasound doppler systems used for peripheral vascular testing and fetal monitoring applications. We intend to continue to invest in CooperSurgical business through acquisitions of companies and product lines. In the fiscal first quarter of 2011, we refinanced our syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit due to mature on January 31, 2012, with a new Credit Agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million and an amortizing term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million, each of which, mature on January 12, 2016. On February 15, 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, from borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility. At October 31, 2011, we had $650.7 million available under the Credit Agreement. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and long-term cash requirements for capital expenditures, acquisitions and cash dividends. 2011 Compared with 2010 Highlights: 2011 vs. 2010 Net sales up 15% to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2010. Gross margin 60% of net sales up from 58%. Operating income up 20% to $227.6 million from $189.9 million. Interest expense down 53% to $17.3 million from $36.7 million. Diluted earnings per share up 49% to $3.63 from $2.43. Operating cash flow $336.3 million up 26% from $267.7 million. 41 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Pre-tax results include in the current year a reserve of $20.4 million related to the limited recall of Avaira contact lenses, costs of $16.5 million related to the redemption of our Senior Notes, a $10.0 million charge related to the settlement of all claims in a patent infringement lawsuit and restructuring costs of $1.9 million related to the CooperVision manufacturing restructuring plan that was completed in fiscal 2011. In the prior year, pre-tax results included settlement charges of $27.8 million related to the securities class action litigation and the derivative litigation and $16.1 million related to the CooperVision manufacturing restructuring plan.

CooperVision produces a broad range of monthly, two-week and single-use contact lenses, featuring advanced materials and optics. CooperVision brings a commitment to solving the toughest vision challenges such as astigmatism, presbyopia and ocular dryness; with a broad collection of spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses. CooperSurgical develops, manufactures and markets medical devices and procedure solutions to improve healthcare delivery to women regardless of the clinical setting. Net Sales Growth by Business Unit Our consolidated net sales grew by $172.3 million in fiscal 2011 and $78.1 million in 2010: ($ in millions) 2011 vs. 2010 % Change 2010 vs. 2009 % Change CooperVision $ 150.6 16 % $ 61.0 7 % CooperSurgical 21.7 12 % 17.1 10 % $ 172.3 15 % $ 78.1 7 % 42 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CooperVision Net Sales The contact lens market has two major product categories: Spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects. Toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. In order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear, products are sold with recommended replacement schedules, often defined as modalities, with the primary modalities being single-use, two-week and monthly. CooperVision offers spherical, aspherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities. The contact lens market consists primarily of disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Significantly, the market for spherical lenses is growing with value-added spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. CooperVision Proclear brand aspheric, toric and multifocal contact lenses, manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology, help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort. CooperVision Biofinity brand silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses and Avaira brand spherical and toric products are manufactured using proprietary Aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear. We believe that it is important to develop a full range of multifocal and single-use silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel products offered by our major competitors. Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 18% and total spheres up 12%. Total toric lenses grew 16%, including 26% growth of single-use toric lenses, and multifocal lenses grew 4%. Silicone hydrogel products grew 49% worldwide. Proclear products increased 10% driven by growth of single-use lenses. Older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 13% and 17%, respectively. CooperVision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. 43 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CooperVision Net Sales by Region ($ in millions) 2011 2010 Growth Americas $ 469.7 $ 432.8 9 % EMEA 398.5 351.8 13 % Asia Pacific 252.9 185.9 36 % $ 1,121.1 $ 970.5 16 % CooperVision worldwide net sales grew 16% in the period-to-period comparison. Americas net sales grew 9%, primarily due to market gains of CooperVision silicone hydrogel contact lenses and single-use lenses. In our fiscal first quarter of 2010, we recorded $10.1 million of reductions to Americas net sales due to out-of-period adjustments to increase accruals for rebates that were under-accrued in fiscal 2009. EMEA net sales grew 13% driven by increases in sales of silicone hydrogel lenses and single-use lenses. Net sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 36%, primarily due to sales growth of single-use spherical and toric products and silicone hydrogel lenses; these results include sales of $31.3 million related to product lines acquired on December 1, 2010 from Asahikasei Aime Co., Ltd. CooperVision net sales growth is driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products, primarily silicone hydrogel lenses, along with acquisitions and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CooperVision sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CooperSurgical Net Sales CooperSurgical fiscal 2011 net sales increased 12% from fiscal 2010 to $209.7 million with net sales growth excluding acquisitions of 8%. Sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 23% and represented 37% of CooperSurgical fiscal 2011 net sales compared to 33% in the prior fiscal year. CooperSurgical sales are primarily comprised of women healthcare products used by gynecologists and obstetricians in both office and surgical procedures. The balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CooperSurgical does not actively market. Unit growth and product mix along with increased average realized prices on disposable products influenced organic sales growth. 2010 Compared with 2009 Highlights: 2010 vs. 2009 Net sales up 7% to $1.2 billion from $1.08 billion in fiscal year 2009. Gross margin 58% of net sales up from 55%. Operating income up 27% to $189.9 million from $149.9 million.

In our fiscal first quarter of 2010, we recorded $10.1 million of reductions to Americas net sales due to out-of-period adjustments to increase accruals for rebates that were under-accrued in fiscal 2009. EMEA net sales grew 2% in the period driven by increases in sales of silicone hydrogel lenses and single-use lenses. Net sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 8%, primarily due to sales growth of single-use spherical and toric products and silicone hydrogel lenses. CooperVision net sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products, primarily silicone hydrogel lenses. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CooperVision sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CooperSurgical Net Sales CooperSurgical fiscal 2010 net sales increased 10% from fiscal 2009 to $188.0 million with net sales growth excluding acquisitions of 6%. Sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 18% and represented 33% of CooperSurgical fiscal 2010 net sales compared to 31% in fiscal 2009. CooperSurgical sales are primarily comprised of women healthcare products used by gynecologists and obstetricians in both office and surgical procedures. The balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CooperSurgical does not actively market. Unit growth and product mix along with increased average realized prices on disposable products influenced organic sales growth. 2011 Compared to 2010 and 2010 Compared to 2009 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2011 2010 2009 CooperVision 60 % 57 % 54 % CooperSurgical 65 % 64 % 60 % Consolidated 60 % 58 % 55 % The increases in CooperVision gross margin are largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, primarily the shift to higher margin silicone hydrogel products. CooperVision gross margin in the current year was negatively impacted by the $20.2 million reserve for inventory and return provisions related to the recall of certain lots of Avaira contact lenses discussed above. Gross margin also reflects efficiencies associated with the 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan. Costs associated with the plan, recorded as cost of sales, were $1.9 million for fiscal 2011, $16.0 million for fiscal 2010 and $5.0 million for fiscal 2009. As discussed below, these costs are primarily severance charges and accelerated depreciation, and we do not expect to incur similar costs related to this manufacturing restructuring plan in future periods. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 reflects the increase in accruals for rebates discussed above. Gross margin in fiscal 2009 included costs associated with fixed asset write offs; such costs were not significant in fiscal 2011 or 2010. The increase in CooperSurgical gross margin for fiscal 2011 is largely attributable to manufacturing efficiency improvements and product mix including higher margins on products used in surgical 46 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.

The 20% increase in CooperVision SGA in fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of net sales are primarily due to our increased investment in sales and marketing to reach new customers and to promote our silicone hydrogel products as well as the patent infringement settlement discussed below. The 15% increase in CooperSurgical SGA in fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of sales are primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs to support higher sales and anticipated further growth along with legal expenses related to business acquisitions during the period. Corporate headquarters SGA increased 14% in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased legal costs and share-based compensation expense partially offset by reduced consulting fees.

CooperVision research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing PC Technology. In fiscal 2009, CooperVision recorded a $3.0 million in-process research and development charge related to the acquisition of certain distribution rights. 47 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CooperSurgical research and development expense increased 23% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to investments in the design of the next generation product line of uterine manipulators. Other research and development activities include the upgrade and expansion of CooperSurgical portfolio of assisted reproductive technology products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings. Restructuring Costs 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing Restructuring Plan In the fiscal third quarter of 2009, CooperVision initiated a restructuring plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from Norfolk, Virginia, and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from Adelaide, Australia, to existing manufacturing operations in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, and Hamble, UK (2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan). This plan is intended to better utilize CooperVision manufacturing efficiencies and reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees. CooperVision completed restructuring activities in Adelaide in our fiscal third quarter of 2010 and in Norfolk in our fiscal first quarter of 2011. The total restructuring costs under this plan were approximately $23.1 million, with $15.4 million associated with assets, including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination costs, and $7.7 million associated with employee benefit costs, including severance payments, termination benefit costs, retention bonus payouts and other similar costs. These costs were reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In fiscal 2011, $1.9 million, including $0.8 million of employee benefit costs and $1.1 million of costs associated with assets, primarily non-cash, were reported in cost of sales. In fiscal 2010, $16.1 million, including $3.3 million of employee benefit costs and $12.8 million of costs associated with assets, primarily non-cash, were reported as $16.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs. In fiscal 2009, $5.1 million including $3.6 million of employee benefit costs and $1.5 million of non-cash costs associated with assets were reported as $5.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs. The Company may, from time to time, decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $20.5 million in fiscal 2011, $18.1 million in fiscal 2010 and $17.9 million in fiscal 2009. Amortization expense in fiscal 2009 includes a $1.5 million charge for a CooperSurgical license that no longer had value. 48 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Operating Income Operating income grew $77.7 million, or 52%, between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, increasing $37.7 million or 20% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 and $40.0 million or 27% in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009.

Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 53% to $17.3 million in 2011 constituting 1% of net sales in fiscal 2011 as compared to 3% of net sales in the fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 decrease reflects lower interest rates primarily as a result of the redemption of our Senior Notes in February 2011 and lower average debt in the current period. Interest expense decreased 17% to $36.7 million in fiscal 2010 and decreased 17% to $44.1 million in 2009. The fiscal 2010 and 2009 decreases primarily reflect reduced long-term borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates. We had $339.7 million in loans on our Credit Agreement at October 31, 2011, compared to $591.8 million at October 31, 2010. Extinguishment of Debt In February 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Notes issued on January 31, 2007. In accordance with the Indenture, the redemption price for the Notes was 103.563% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to February 15, 2011, the redemption date. In our fiscal second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $16.5 million loss on the repurchase that includes the write-off of approximately $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of $12.1 million related to the Senior Notes in our Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under its new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility. In December 2008, we purchased through the open market, in a privately negotiated transaction, $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.125% Senior Notes at a discounted price of approximately $9.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest. We also wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized costs related to the Senior Notes and recorded the $1.8 million gain on the repurchase in other income in our Consolidated Statement of Income. 49 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Settlements On December 2, 2011, CooperVision and Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. entered into a settlement agreement whereby CooperVision agreed to make a lump sum payment of $10.0 million to Rembrandt, and Rembrandt granted a covenant not to sue regarding patent infringement claims. The Company recorded a charge for the settlement in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011. The Company and several of its directors and officers had been named in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit, the nature and status of which is described in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies. The Company announced on May 4, 2010, that it reached an agreement in principle and recorded a charge in our fiscal second quarter of 2010 to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit for $27.0 million, which we funded into escrow in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. The Court granted final approval of the proposed settlement on December 13, 2010. The Company also was a nominal defendant in shareholder derivative litigation against several current and former officers and directors of the Company. The Company reached a settlement agreement to pay attorney fees of counsel to the plaintiff in the amount of $750 thousand. The Company recorded a charge for the settlement amount in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. Other (Loss) Income, Net Years Ended October 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Foreign exchange (loss) gain $ (1.0 ) $ (1.2 ) $ 7.0 Other, net 0.0 0.1 0.3 $ (1.0 ) $ (1.1 ) $ 7.3 The fiscal 2009 foreign exchange net gain is primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against other currencies and an initiative we completed in the quarter related to intercompany transactions. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $17.3 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $11.6 million in fiscal 2010. Cooper effective tax rate (ETR) (provision for income taxes divided by pretax income) for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 was about 9%. The ETR is below the United States statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent periods with income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as compared to income earned in the United States. As a result, the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income primarily within CooperVision has decreased over recent fiscal periods. A reduction in the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where the Company operates are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the United States. The completion of the Company restructuring plan to close a CooperVision manufacturing facility, located in Norfolk, Virginia, with the manufacturing demand subsequently 50 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) absorbed by our plants in the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico contributed to this change in the geographic mix of income. As a result of this restructuring, substantially all of CooperVision contact lens products are manufactured outside of the United States. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a $16.5 million domestic loss on the repurchase of its Senior Notes that included the write off of about $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of $12.1 million. This impacted the Company tax provision and further reduced the overall effective tax rate. Share-Based Compensation Plans The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2011 was $14.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, compared to $10.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in fiscal 2010. As of October 31, 2011, there was $32.4 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards: $7.2 million for stock options; $19.0 million for restricted stock units; and $6.2 million for performance shares. The unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 2.7 years for nonvested stock options, 2.9 years for restricted stock units and 1.8 years for performance shares. Cash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation arrangements for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $82.0 million, $11.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. The use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value. The expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. If our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2011 would have increased by approximately $1.50. To determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. If our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2011 would have increased by less than $1. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping, and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. These adjustments totaled $1.9 million, $1.2 million and $2.9 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company grants performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers if the Company achieves specified long-term performance goals over a three-year period. The Company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current 51 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) market price of our common stock. The total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates. The Company reviews our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter. If achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable, previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement. If we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment, additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2011 Highlights Operating cash flow $336.3 million, compared to $267.7 million in fiscal 2010. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $103.7 million, compared to $73.8 million in fiscal 2010. Total debt decreased to $380.4 million at the end of fiscal 2011 from $611.1 million at the end of fiscal 2010. Cash payments for acquisitions totaled $58.0 million vs. $32.8 million in fiscal 2010. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.2 $ 3.6 Total assets $ 2,624.5 $ 2,525.0 Working capital $ 273.1 $ 291.8 Total debt $ 380.4 $ 611.1 Stockholders equity $ 1,937.5 $ 1,666.8 Ratio of debt to equity 0.20:1 0.37:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 16 % 27 % Working Capital The decrease in working capital at the end of fiscal 2011 from the end of fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, including the charge related to the Rembrandt settlement, and short-term debt including the portion of the term loan which became current during the fiscal year. This decrease was partially offset by increases in trade accounts receivable, inventory and a decrease in accrued interest payable. The decrease in accrued interest payable was due to lower interest rates primarily as a result of the redemption of our Senior Notes in February 2011, lower average outstanding debt and the timing of interest payments. The increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory were primarily due to the growth in sales and to production to support new product launches. At October 31, 2011, Cooper inventory months on hand (MOH) were 5.9, excluding the reserves for inventory related to the recall of certain lots of 52 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Avaira contact lenses, representing an increase from 5.4 at October 31, 2010. Including the reserves for inventory MOH were 5.5 at October 31, 2011. Our days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 55 days in fiscal 2011 from 57 days in the prior fiscal year. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our reported accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. The Company has reviewed its needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company presently intends to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the United States of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment requirements. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow provided by operating activities continued in fiscal 2011 as Cooper major source of liquidity, increasing to $336.3 million from $267.7 million in fiscal 2010 and $223.1 million in fiscal 2009. The $68.6 million increase in cash flow provided by operations from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the increase in net income of $62.6 million. Fiscal 2011 results include $175.4 million of net income, $114.8 million of non-cash items primarily related to depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and currency translation and $16.5 million for the loss on extinguishment of debt. Results also include $29.6 million from the net changes in assets and liabilities. For fiscal 2011, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products totaling $1.3 billion. Our uses of cash flows provided by operating activities included $939.4 million used primarily for personnel and material costs and cash payments of $25.6 million and $12.2 million for interest and income tax, respectively. For fiscal 2010, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products totaling $1.1 billion. Our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities included $819.0 million used for personnel and material costs and cash payments of $36.7 million and $8.6 million for interest and income tax, respectively. Investing Cash Flow Cash used in investing activities of $161.7 million in fiscal 2011 was for capital expenditures of $103.7 million, primarily to improve manufacturing efficiency, and payments of $58.0 million related to acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities of $106.6 million in fiscal 2010 was for capital expenditures of $73.8 million primarily to improve manufacturing capacity and payments of $32.8 million related to acquisitions. Financing Cash Flow The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments of debt as well as proceeds from share-based compensation award exercises and dividend payments. Cash 53 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) used in financing activities of $172.9 million in fiscal 2011 was driven by net repayments of debt of $242.8 million, including the redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes and the related redemption premium, acquisition costs related to the Credit Agreement of $9.6 million, a $2.6 million payment for contingent consideration and dividends paid on our common stock of $2.8 million, offset by proceeds of $82.0 million from the exercise of share-based compensation awards and $2.9 million for the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements. Cash used in financing activities of $161.6 million in fiscal 2010 was driven by net repayments of long-term debt of $182.5 million, including the capital lease, and dividends paid on our common stock of $2.7 million, offset by proceeds from short-term debt of $12.1 million and $11.5 million from the exercise of share-based compensation awards and related tax benefit. At October 31, 2011, we had $650.7 million available under the Credit Agreement, and we are in compliance with the covenants including the Interest Coverage Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio at 21.42 to 1.00 versus the requirement to be at least 3.00 to 1.00 and 1.03 to 1.00 versus the requirement to remain below 3.75 to 1.00, respectively. As defined in the Credit Agreement, the Interest Coverage Ratio is the ratio of Consolidated Proforma EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense and the Total Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated Proforma EBITDA. Risk Management We operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide. As a result, our earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, sales transactions, capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange, primarily to the British pound, euro, Japanese yen, Swedish krona, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. Our policy is to minimize, to the extent reasonable and practical, transaction, remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure, these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on our Credit Agreement may vary with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through December 2014. For additional detail, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In the fiscal first quarter of 2011, we refinanced our syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit due to mature on January 31, 2012, with a new Credit Agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million and an amortizing term loan facility with an original principal amount of $250.0 million, each of which, mature on January 12, 2016. On February 15, 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, from borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility. 54 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.

Employee Benefits. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, such amounts of our long-term income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above. However, other long-term liabilities, included in our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions. For additional information, please see Note 5. Income Taxes. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years. New Accounting Pronouncements On November 1, 2010, the Company adopted portions of the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-6, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements . This ASU added new requirements for disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements and (4) the transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements. The requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis will be effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires enhanced disclosures, as applicable, its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 55 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2010-29, Business Combinations: Disclosure of Supplementary Proforma Information for Business Combinations, which amends ASC 805, Business Combinations . The amendments in this ASU affect any public entity as defined by ASC 805 that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. The amendments in this ASU specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments also expand the supplemental proforma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring proforma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported proforma revenue and earnings. The amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010-29, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2011, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, Intangibles Goodwill and Other: When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts , which amends ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . The amendments in this ASU modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010-28, which is effective for the Company on November 1, 2011, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is not permitted. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which amends ASC 820 , Fair Value Measurement. This ASU represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the Boards) on fair value measurement. The amendments (1) clarify the Boards intent regarding the application of existing fair value measurement guidance, (2) revise certain measurement guidance that changes or modifies a principle and (3) add disclosure requirements concerning the measurement uncertainty of level 3 measurements. The Boards concluded that the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and are to be applied prospectively. Early application is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2011-04, which is effective for the Company on November 1, 2012, on our consolidated financial statements. 56 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This ASU, which amends ASC 220, Comprehensive Income , allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both options, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments made by ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively and become effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2011-05, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2012, will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment . ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test as described in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other . The ASU defines the more-likely-than-not threshold as having a likelihood of more than 50%. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2012, will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition We recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns, and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. As required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contact 57 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) lenses as well as CooperSurgical medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs when title and risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. The Company records taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the consistent healthcare needs of patients regardless of the economic environment. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability. We reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market, resulting in a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, five to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and women healthcare product portfolios. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards. We performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2011, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CooperVision and CooperSurgical reflecting the way that we manage our business. 58 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The fair value of our reporting units was determined using the income valuation approach. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. In the application of the income approach, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital. We used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units, with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy. The discount rates used in the current year are about 100 basis points lower than those used in our analysis for fiscal year 2010 reflecting the current condition of the United States and global economy. The Company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near-term net sales expectations and long-term projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports. As a sensitivity analysis, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2011 and extending through the valuation period would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. Goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, the Company may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of its goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders equity and financial condition. Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Based on the FASB revision to the accounting standard for business combinations, we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree generally at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. As of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. During the fiscal third quarter of 2011, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment related to CooperVision acquisition of certain assets of Asahikasei Aime Co., Ltd. (Aime), reported in our fiscal first quarter of 2011, to reduce the amount of recorded goodwill and reverse the $6.1 million gain on settlement of preexisting relationship. The Company determined that it incorrectly applied the guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations , relating to the settlement of preexisting relationships due to our interpretation of specific language in the underlying contract. Based upon an evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and after considering the 59 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) provisions of ASC 270-10-45-16, Accounting Changes in Interim Periods , and ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , that incorporates SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality , and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements , we do not believe that the effect of the out-of-period adjustment is material to our fiscal year 2011 financial results. We also do not believe that the out-of-period adjustment is material to any previously issued quarterly consolidated financial statements. Based on this assessment of materiality, the out-of-period adjustment was recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal third quarter of 2011. There is no impact on our fiscal year results as the error and its correction were both recorded in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011. Income taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. Regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. We measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . The interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our Consolidated Statement of Income and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense. 60 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Share-Based Compensation The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance unit shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Under fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper stock price volatility, employee exercise behaviors and related employee forfeiture rates. The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. In determining the expected volatility, management considers implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant. As share-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period. 61 Table of Contents
