Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated) Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) addresses the financial condition of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, The Hartford or the Company ) as of December 31, 2010, compared with December 31, 2009, and its results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes beginning on page F-1. The Hartford made changes to its reporting segments in 2010 to reflect the manner in which the Company is currently organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, segment data for prior reporting periods has been adjusted to reflect the new segment reporting, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further discussion. Additionally, certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation. The Hartford defines increases or decreases greater than or equal to 200%, or changes from a net gain to a net loss position, or vice versa, as NM or not meaningful.

Excluding the after-tax impacts of net realized capital losses, DAC Unlocks and goodwill impairments, earnings decreased $46 from 2009 to 2010. See the segment sections of the MD&A for a discussion on their respective performances. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The decrease in consolidated net loss was primarily due to a decrease in net realized losses, which included other-than-temporary impairments of $1.5 billion in 2009 compared to $4.0 billion in 2008, and gains on the variable annuity hedge program of $631 in 2009 compared to losses of $639 in 2008. Partially offsetting the decrease in realized losses was approximately $300 in net realized capital losses in 2009 related to the settlement of a contingent obligation to Allianz SE ( Allianz ). Goodwill impairments of $32, after-tax, in 2009 compared to impairments of $597, after-tax, in 2008 also contributed to the decrease in net loss. Excluding the after-tax impacts of net realized capital losses and goodwill impairments, earnings decreased $608 from 2008 to 2009 driven by decreases in fee income due to lower average assets under management primarily in Global Annuity, lower net investment income on available-for-sale and other securities primarily due to lower income on fixed maturities, and restructuring costs. See the segment sections of the MD&A for a discussion on their respective performances. Income Taxes The effective tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 26%, 49%, and 40%, respectively. The principal causes of the differences between the effective rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were tax-exempt interest earned on invested assets and the separate account dividends received deduction ( DRD ). This caused a decrease in the tax expense on the 2010 pre-tax income and an increase in the tax benefit on the 2009 and 2008 pre-tax losses. The effective tax rate for 2010 also includes the effect of an increase in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset and the effective tax rate for 2009 includes the tax effect of a non-deductible expense related to the settlement of a contingent obligation to Allianz. For additional information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The separate account DRD is estimated for the current year using information from the prior year-end, adjusted for current year equity market performance and other appropriate factors, including estimated levels of corporate dividend payments. The actual current year DRD can vary from estimates based on, but not limited to, changes in eligible dividends received by the mutual funds, amounts of distribution from these mutual funds, amounts of short-term capital gains at the mutual fund level and the Company taxable income before the DRD. The Company recorded benefits of $145, $181 and $176 related to the separate account DRD in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts included benefits (charges) related to prior years tax returns of $(3), $29 and $9 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 31 Table of Contents In Revenue Ruling 2007-61, issued on September 25, 2007, the IRS announced its intention to issue regulations with respect to certain computational aspects of the DRD on separate account assets held in connection with variable annuity contracts. Revenue Ruling 2007-61 suspended Revenue Ruling 2007-54, issued in August 2007 that purported to change accepted industry and IRS interpretations of the statutes governing these computational questions. Any regulations that the IRS may ultimately propose for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment, at which time insurance companies and other members of the public will have the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the content, scope and application of such regulations. As a result, the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are unknown, but they could result in the elimination of some or all of the separate account DRD tax benefit that the Company receives. Management believes that it is highly likely that any such regulations would apply prospectively only. The Company receives a foreign tax credit against its U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes paid by the Company including payments from its separate account assets. The separate account foreign tax credit is estimated for the current year using information from the most recent filed return, adjusted for the change in the allocation of separate account investments to the international equity markets during the current year. The actual current year foreign tax credit can vary from the estimates due to actual foreign tax credits passed through by the mutual funds. The Company recorded benefits of $4, $16 and $16 related to the separate account foreign tax credit in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts included benefits (charges) related to prior years tax returns of $(4), $3 and $4 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company unrecognized tax benefits were unchanged during 2010, remaining at $48 as of December 31, 2010. This entire amount, if it were recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. 32 Table of Contents OUTLOOKS The Hartford provides projections and other forward-looking information in the following discussions, which contain many forward-looking statements, particularly relating to the Company future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the Company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to the precautionary statements set forth on page 3 of this Form 10-K. Actual results are likely to differ, and in the past have differed, materially from those forecast by the Company, depending on the outcome of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in each discussion below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors. In 2011, The Hartford will continue to focus on growing its three customer-oriented divisions, Commercial Markets, Consumer Markets, and Wealth Management, through enhanced product development, leveraging synergies of the divisions product offerings to meet customer needs, and increased efficiencies throughout the organization. The speed and extent of economic and employment expansion may impact the asset protection businesses where insureds may change their level of insurance, and asset accumulation businesses may see customers changing their level of savings based on anticipated economic conditions. The performance of The Hartford divisions is subject to uncertainty due to market conditions, which impact the earnings of its asset management businesses and the valuation and earnings on its investment portfolio. Commercial Markets Commercial Markets will continue to focus on growth through market-differentiated products and services while maintaining a disciplined underwriting approach. In the Property & Casualty Commercial insurance marketplace, improving market conditions are expected to allow for moderate price increases, while a slowly-recovering economy will result in an increase in insurance exposures. Within Property & Casualty Commercial, the Company expects low to mid single-digit written premium growth in 2011, due to an increase in pricing, higher new business premium and an increase in premium retention. Additionally, Property & Casualty Commercial is expected to continue to grow policy counts, particularly for our small commercial business, led by an increase in workers compensation in force. This growth potential reflects the combination of our current market position, a broadening of underwriting expertise focused on selected industries, a leveraging of the payroll model, and numerous initiatives launched in the past several years. Initiatives include programs aimed at improving policy count retention, the rollout of new product offerings and the introduction of ease of doing business technology for our small commercial business. The Property & Casualty Commercial combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development is expected to be slightly higher in 2011 than the 93.4 achieved in 2010 as pricing increases are expected to largely offset loss cost changes. In the Group Benefits, the economic downturn, combined with the potential for employees to lessen spending on the Company products and the overall competitive environment, reduced premium levels in 2010. Premium levels are expected to remain relatively flat in 2011, or until there is economic expansion with lower unemployment rates compared to 2010 levels. Over time, as employers design benefit strategies to attract and retain employees, while attempting to control their benefit costs, management believes that the need for the Company products will continue to expand. This combined with the significant number of employees who currently do not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage, creates continued opportunities for our products and services. The Company experienced higher disability loss ratios in 2010. The Company anticipates loss ratios to remain essentially flat in 2011. Consumer Markets In 2011, Consumer Markets expects to increase its business written with AARP members and enter into new affinity relationships. Management expects new business will primarily be generated from continued direct marketing to AARP members, marketing to households associated with other affinity groups, expanding the sale of the Open Road Advantage auto product through independent agents and introducing an enhanced homeowners product called Hartford Home Advantage. The Company distributes its discounted AARP Open Road Advantage auto product through those independent agents who are authorized to offer the AARP product and, beginning in 2011, will distribute its Hartford Home Advantage product on a discounted basis through those same authorized agents. The Company expects non-AARP member Agency earned premium to decline in 2011 as the result of continued pricing and underwriting actions to improve profitability, including efforts to reposition the book into more business for insureds aged 40+. As of December 31, 2010, the Open Road Advantage auto product was available in 33 states and the Company expects the product to be available to authorized agents in 42 states by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The Company began rolling out its Hartford Home Advantage product during the first quarter of 2011 and expects the product to be available in 39 states by the end of 2011. Management expects that the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development will improve in 2011, driven by earned pricing increases, slightly improving claim frequency and modest claim severity in both auto and home as the Company expects to benefit from a continued shift to a more preferred mix of business. 33 Table of Contents Wealth Management The partial equity market recovery over the last eighteen months has driven an increase in deposits and assets under management; however profitability rates are not consistent with historical levels. The current market conditions and market volatility have increased the cost and volatility of hedging programs, and the level of capital needed to support living benefit guarantees when compared to historical levels. Management is committed to the U.S. variable annuity marketplace and will continue to evaluate the benefits offered within its variable annuities, and ensure the product portfolio meets customer needs within the risk tolerances of The Hartford. Wealth Management seeks to achieve scale through increased deposits and market improvements along with a focus on expense reductions. Wealth Management will focus on product development to increase sales of its products and services to the baby boomer generation. The Company expects that many baby boomers will be looking to provide more stability to the value of their accumulated wealth and will focus more on identifying and creating dependable and certain income streams that can provide known payments throughout their retirement. As the mutual fund business continues to evolve, success will be driven by diversifying net sales across the mutual fund platform, delivering superior investment performance and creating new investment solutions for current and future mutual fund shareholders. Wealth Management will increase future sales of its Life Insurance products by implementing strategies to expand distribution capabilities, including utilizing independent agents and continuing to build on the strong relationships within the financial institution marketplace. Retirement Plans looks to continue to focus on our clients increasing needs for retirement income security given the recent volatility in the financial markets and to provide products that respond to the needs of plan sponsors to manage risk and stretch their benefit dollars. 34 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past has differed, from those estimates. The Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; estimated gross profits used in the valuation and amortization of assets and liabilities associated with variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts; evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on investments; living benefits required to be fair valued (in other policyholder funds and benefits payable); goodwill impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters. Certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements. Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance The Hartford establishes reserves on its property and casualty insurance products to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims and the actual reported loss and loss adjustment expenses ( reported losses ). Reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims. Company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (IBNR and case reserves) on an accident year basis. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported. Reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment. Potential external factors include (1) changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care, hospital care, auto parts, wages and home repair; (2) changes in the general economic environment that could cause unanticipated changes in the claim frequency per unit insured; (3) changes in the litigation environment as evidenced by changes in claimant attorney representation in the claims negotiation and settlement process; (4) changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage and/or the amount of damages awarded for certain types of damages; (5) changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages; (6) changes in the legislative environment regarding the definition of damages; and (7) new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious exposure: past examples include lead paint, construction defects and tainted Chinese-made drywall. Reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal Company operations. Potential internal factors include (1) periodic changes in claims handling procedures; (2) growth in new lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established; or (3) changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process. In the case of assumed reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. In addition, changes in ceding company case reserving and reporting patterns can create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the reserves. Due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future. Through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks it has underwritten to other insurance companies. The Company net reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses include anticipated recovery from reinsurers on unpaid claims. The estimated amount of the anticipated recovery, or reinsurance recoverable, is net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. 35 Table of Contents Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including IBNR unpaid losses. The Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate by reinsurance agreement of how IBNR losses will ultimately be ceded. The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers unwillingness or inability to pay. The Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company reinsurers. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $290 as of December 31, 2010, including $79 related to Property & Casualty Commercial and $211 related to Other Operations. The Company estimate of reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Hartford, like other insurance companies, categorizes and tracks its insurance reserves for its segments by line of business . Furthermore, The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business. In addition, the Other Operations operating segment, within Corporate and Other, includes reserves for asbestos and environmental ( A&E ) claims. Adjustments to previously established reserves, which may be material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. In the judgment of management, information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for losses and loss adjustment expenses. The following table shows loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business as of December 31, 2010, net of reinsurance: Property & Casualty Consumer Corporate and Total Property and Commercial Markets Other Casualty Insurance Reserve Line of Business Commercial property $ 162 $ $ $ 162 Homeowners 435 435 Auto physical damage 13 15 28 Auto liability 587 1,674 2,261 Package business 1,256 1,256 Workers compensation 6,701 6,701 General liability 2,720 34 2,754 Professional liability 644 644 Fidelity and surety 269 269 Assumed reinsurance [1] 400 400 All other non-A&E 901 901 A&E 14 2 2,121 2,137 Total reserves-net 12,366 2,160 3,422 17,948 Reinsurance and other recoverables 2,361 17 699 3,077 Total reserves-gross $ 14,727 $ 2,177 $ 4,121 $ 21,025 [1] These net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relate to assumed reinsurance that was moved into Other Operations (formerly known as HartRe ). Reserving Methodology (See Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims within Other Operations for a discussion of how A&E reserves are set) How reserves are set Reserves are set by line of business within the various segments. A single line of business may be written in more than one segment. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which loss data (e.g., paid losses and case reserves) emerge (i.e., is reported) over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which loss data emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company shortest-tail lines of business are property and auto physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers compensation, general liability, professional liability and assumed reinsurance. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses. 36 Table of Contents Company reserving actuaries, who are independent of the business units, regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. For most lines of business, these reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis. These selections incorporate input, as judged by the reserving actuaries to be appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management on reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. Most reserves are reviewed fully each quarter, including loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for property, auto physical damage, auto liability, package business, workers compensation, most general liability, professional liability and fidelity and surety. Other reserves are reviewed semi-annually (twice per year) or annually. These include, but are not limited to, reserves for losses incurred before 1990, assumed reinsurance, latent exposures such as construction defects, unallocated loss adjustment expense and all other non-A&E exposures. For reserves that are reviewed semi-annually or annually, management monitors the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters to either confirm that the estimate of ultimate losses should not change or, if necessary, perform a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change. An expected loss ratio is used in initially recording the reserves for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business. This expected loss ratio is determined through a review of prior accident years loss ratios and expected changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current accident year. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period. In addition to the expected loss ratio, the actuarial techniques or methods used primarily include paid and reported loss development and frequency / severity techniques as well as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more influence vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to herein as the actuarial indication . As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, net property and casualty insurance product reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) were approximately equal to net reserves reported on a statutory basis. Under U.S. GAAP, liabilities for unpaid losses for permanently disabled workers compensation claimants are discounted at rates that are no higher than risk-free interest rates and which generally exceed the statutory discount rates set by regulators, such that workers compensation reserves for statutory reporting are higher than the reserves for U.S. GAAP reporting. Largely offsetting the effect of the difference in discounting is that a portion of the U.S. GAAP provision for uncollectible reinsurance is not recognized under statutory accounting. Most of the Company property and casualty insurance product reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted certain reserves for indemnity payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers compensation policies. Provided below is a general discussion of which methods are preferred by line of business. Because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business (e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), this description should not be assumed to apply to each coverage and accident year within a line of business. Also, as circumstances change, the methods that are given more influence will change. Property and Auto Physical Damage. These lines are fast-developing and paid and reported development techniques are used as these methods use historical data to develop paid and reported loss development patterns, which are then applied to current paid and reported losses by accident period to estimate ultimate losses. The Company relies primarily on reported development techniques although a review of frequency and severity and the initial loss expectation based on the expected loss ratio is used for the most immature accident months. The advantage of frequency / severity techniques is that frequency estimates are generally easier to predict and external information can be used to supplement internal data in making severity estimates. Personal Auto Liability. For auto liability, and bodily injury in particular, the Company performs a greater number of techniques than it does for property and auto physical damage. In addition, because the paid development technique is affected by changes in claim closure patterns and the reported development method is affected by changes in case reserving practices, the Company uses Berquist-Sherman techniques which adjust these patterns to reflect current settlement rates and case reserving techniques. The Company generally uses the reported development method for older accident years as a higher percentage of ultimate losses are reflected in reported losses than in cumulative paid losses and the frequency/severity and Berquist-Sherman methods for more recent accident years. Recent periods are influenced by changes in case reserve practices and changing disposal rates; the frequency/severity techniques are not affected as much by these changes and the Berquist-Sherman techniques specifically adjust for these changes. Auto Liability for Commercial Lines and Short-Tailed General Liability. The Company performs a variety of techniques, including the paid and reported development methods and frequency / severity techniques. For older, more mature accident years, management finds that reported development techniques are best. For more recent accident years, management typically prefers frequency / severity techniques that make separate assumptions about loss activity above and below a selected capping level. Long-Tailed General Liability, Fidelity and Surety and Large Deductible Workers Compensation . For these long-tailed lines of business, the Company generally relies on the expected loss ratio and reported development techniques. Management generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the expected loss ratio method at early ages of development and more on the reported development method as an accident year matures. 37 Table of Contents Workers Compensation . Workers compensation is the Company single largest reserve line of business so a wide range of methods are reviewed in the reserve analysis. Methods performed include paid and reported development, variations on expected loss ratio methods, and an in-depth analysis on the largest states. Historically, paid development patterns in the Company workers compensation business have been stable, so paid techniques are preferred for older accident periods. For more recent periods, paid techniques are less predictive of the ultimate liability since such a low percentage of ultimate losses are paid in early periods of development. Accordingly, for more recent accident periods, the Company generally relies more heavily on a state-by-state analysis and the expected loss ratio approach. Professional Liability. Reported and paid loss developments patterns for this line tend to be volatile. Therefore, the Company typically relies on frequency and severity techniques. Assumed Reinsurance and All Other. For these lines, management tends to rely on the reported development techniques. In assumed reinsurance, assumptions are influenced by information gained from claim and underwriting audits. Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE). For some lines of business (e.g., professional liability and assumed reinsurance), ALAE and losses are analyzed together. For most lines of business, however, ALAE is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments. Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expense (ULAE). ULAE is analyzed separately from loss and ALAE. For most lines of business, incurred ULAE costs to be paid in the future are projected based on an expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ULAE to paid loss. The final step in the reserve review process involves a comprehensive review by senior reserving actuaries who apply their judgment and, in concert with senior management, determine the appropriate level of reserves based on the information that has been accumulated. Numerous factors are considered in this process including, but not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to the prior periods. Total recorded net reserves, excluding asbestos and environmental, were 3.2% higher than the actuarial indication of the reserves as of December 31, 2010. See the Reserve Development section for a discussion of changes to reserve estimates recorded in 2010. Current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty The Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty insurance business. The Hartford is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a number of conditions, including but not limited to those noted above, any of which could be material at any point in time. Certain issues may become more or less important over time as conditions change. As various market conditions develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend that should result in a reserving action (i.e., increasing or decreasing the reserve). Within Property & Casualty Commercial and Other Operations, the Company has exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances. Examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, silica and lead paint. The Company also has exposure to claims from construction defects, where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. In addition, the Company has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or abuse. Such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods. These factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. With regard to these exposures, the Company is monitoring trends in litigation, the external environment, the similarities to other mass torts and the potential impact on the Company reserves. In Consumer Markets, reserving estimates are generally less variable than for the Company other property and casualty segments because of the coverages having relatively shorter periods of loss emergence. Estimates, however, can still vary due to a number of factors, including interpretations of frequency and severity trends and their impact on recorded reserve levels. Severity trends can be impacted by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices in addition to changes in the external environment. These changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. In addition, the introduction of new products has led to a different mix of business by type of insured than the Company experienced in the past. Such changes in mix increase the uncertainty of the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the new business. In standard commercial lines, workers compensation is the Company single biggest line of business and the line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. Reserve estimates for workers compensation are particularly sensitive to changes in medical inflation, the changing use of medical care procedures and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments. Medical costs make up more than 50% of workers compensation payments and it is possible that federal health care reform will impact medical payments in workers compensation. These changes increase the uncertainty in the application of development patterns. In addition, over the past several accident years, the Company has experienced favorable claim frequency on workers compensation claims. The Company reserve estimates assume that severity will not be adversely impacted by the lower volume of reported claims. 38 Table of Contents In specialty lines, many lines of insurance are long-tail , including large deductible workers compensation insurance, as such, reserve estimates for these lines are more difficult to determine than reserve estimates for shorter-tail lines of insurance. Estimating required reserve levels for large deductible workers compensation insurance is further complicated by the uncertainty of whether losses that are attributable to the deductible amount will be paid by the insured; if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the Company would be contractually liable. Another example of reserve variability relates to reserves for directors and officers insurance. There is potential volatility in the required level of reserves due to the continued uncertainty regarding the number and severity of class action suits, including uncertainty regarding the Company exposure to losses arising from the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market. Additionally, the Company exposure to losses under directors and officers insurance policies is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex. The recent financial market turmoil has increased the number of shareholder class action lawsuits against our insureds or their directors and officers and this trend could continue for some period of time. Impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility As stated above, the Company practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. Within its reserve estimation process for reserves other than asbestos and environmental, the Company does not consistently use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges. The reserve estimation process includes assumptions about a number of factors in the internal and external environment. Across most lines of business, the most important assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. The trend in loss costs is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible. The following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key indicators of potential losses. Each of the impacts described below is estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key indicators or among lines of business. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company reserves in total. The estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key indicators is a reasonable estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. It is important to note that the variation discussed is not meant to be a worst-case scenario, and therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than the amounts discussed below. Recorded reserves for auto liability, net of reinsurance, are $2.3 billion across all lines, $1.7 billion of which is in Consumer Markets. Personal auto liability reserves are shorter-tailed than other lines of business (such as workers compensation) and, therefore, less volatile. However, the size of the reserve base means that future changes in estimates could be material to the Company results of operations in any given period. The key indicator for Consumer Markets auto liability is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. A 2.5 point change in annual severity for the two most recent accident years would change the estimated net reserve need by $90, in either direction. A 2.5 point change in annual severity is within the Company historical variation. Recorded reserves for workers compensation, net of reinsurance, are $6.7 billion. Loss development patterns are a key indicator for this line of business, particularly for more mature accident years. Historically, loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, medical cost inflation. The Company has reviewed the historical variation in reported loss development patterns. If the reported loss development patterns change by 3%, the estimated net reserve need would change by $400, in either direction. A 3% change in reported loss development patterns is within the Company historical variation, as measured by the variation around the average development factors as reported in statutory accident year reports. Recorded reserves for general liability, net of reinsurance, are $2.8 billion. Loss development patterns are a key indicator for this line of business, particularly for more mature accident years. Historically, loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., construction defect claims) or a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims. The Company has reviewed the historical variation in reported loss development patterns. If the reported loss development patterns change by 9%, the estimated net reserve need would change by $200, in either direction. A 9% change in reported loss development patterns is within the Company historical variation, as measured by the variation around the average development factors as reported in statutory accident year reports. Similar to general liability, assumed casualty reinsurance is affected by reported loss development patterns. In addition to the items identified above that would affect both direct and reinsurance liability claim development patterns, there is also an impact to reporting patterns for any changes in claim notification from ceding companies to the reinsurer. Recorded net reserves for HartRe assumed reinsurance business, excluding asbestos and environmental liabilities, within Other Operations were $400 as of December 31, 2010. If the reported loss development patterns underlying the Company net reserves for HartRe assumed casualty reinsurance change by 10%, the estimated net reserve need would change by $215, in either direction. A 10% change in reported loss development patterns is within the Company historical variation, as measured by the variation around the average development factors as reported in statutory accident year reports. 39 Table of Contents Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims within Other Operations How A&E reserves are set In establishing reserves for asbestos claims, the Company evaluates its insureds estimated liabilities for such claims using a ground-up approach. The Company considers a variety of factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and anticipated future claim activity, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential bankruptcy impact. Similarly, a ground-up exposure review approach is used to establish environmental reserves. The Company evaluation of its insureds estimated liabilities for environmental claims involves consideration of several factors, including historical values of similar claims, the number of sites involved, the insureds alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage at each site, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties at each site, the appropriateness and cost of remediation at each site, the nature of governmental enforcement activities at each site, and potential bankruptcy impact. Having evaluated its insureds probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the Company then evaluates its insureds insurance coverage programs for such claims. The Company considers its insureds total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the Company. The Company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any. Evaluation of both the insureds estimated liabilities and the Company exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This analysis is conducted by the Company lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges. For both asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company also compares its historical direct net loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported experience year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity. Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined for its insureds by each policy year, the Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company experience with reinsurance collections. Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment and the expense to indemnity ratio. The uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos and environmental adds a greater degree of variability to these reserve estimates than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures. While this variability is reflected in part in the size of the range of reserves developed by the Company, that range may still not be indicative of the potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves. The recorded net reserves as of December 31, 2010 of $2.14 billion ($1.80 billion and $339 for asbestos and environmental, respectively) is within an estimated range, unadjusted for covariance, of $1.67 billion to $2.44 billion. The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. However, analyses of future developments could cause the Company to change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to the Company consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Consistent with the Company long-standing reserving practices, the Company will continue to review and monitor its reserves in Other Operations regularly and, where future developments indicate, make appropriate adjustments to the reserves. Total Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance, Results In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for the Company property and casualty businesses at December 31, 2010 represent the Company best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves, and particularly asbestos exposures, it is possible that management estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 40 Table of Contents Reserve Roll-forwards and Development Based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the Company determines the appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. Recorded reserve estimates are changed after consideration of numerous factors, including but not limited to, the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves, improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business. In general, adjustments are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. Such adjustments of reserves are referred to as reserve development . Reserve development that increases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called reserve strengthening . Reserve development that decreases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called reserve releases . Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and is set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow.

Released reserves for personal auto liability claims. Favorable trends in reported severity have persisted, most notably for accident years 2008 and 2009. As these accident years develop, the uncertainty around the ultimate losses is reduced and management places more weight on the emerged experience. The reserve releases impact accident years 2004 through 2009, as some of the older years are also showing improvements in reported severity. Released reserves for professional liability claims, primarily related to directors and officers ( D&O ) claims in accident years 2008 and prior. For these accident years, reported losses for claims under D&O policies have been emerging favorably to initial expectations due to lower than expected claim severity. Released reserves for workers compensation business, primarily related to accident years 2006 and 2007. Management updated reviews of state reforms affecting these accident years and determined impacts to be more favorable than previously estimated. Accordingly, management reduced reserve estimates for these years. Released reserves for general liability claims, primarily related to accident years 2005 through 2008. Claim emergence for these accident years continues to be lower than anticipated. Management now believes this lower level of claim activity will continue into the future and has reduced its reserve estimate in response to these favorable trends. Partially offsetting this reserve release is strengthening on loss adjustment expense reserves during the second quarter of 2010 due to higher than expected allocated loss expenses for claims in accident years 2000 and prior. Released reserves for package business claims, primarily related to accident years 2005 through 2009. Claim emergence within the liability portion of the package coverage for these accident years continues to be lower than anticipated. Management now believes this lower level of claim activity will continue into the future and has reduced its reserve estimate in response to these favorable trends. Strengthened reserves for homeowners claims. During 2010, the Company observed a lengthening of the claim reporting period for homeowners claims for prior accident years which resulted in increasing management estimate of the ultimate cost to settle these claims. The Company is also spending more on independent adjuster fees to better assess property damages. The Company reviewed its allowance for uncollectible reinsurance in the second quarter of 2010 and reduced its allowance, in part, by a reduction in gross ceded loss recoverables. Refer to the Other Operations Claims section for further discussion concerning the Company annual evaluations of net environmental and net asbestos reserves, and related reinsurance. 42 Table of Contents A roll-forward follows of property and casualty insurance product liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009: For the year ended December 31, 2009 Total Property & Property and Casualty Consumer Corporate and Casualty Commercial Markets Other Insurance Beginning liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, gross $ 15,273 $ 2,083 $ 4,577 $ 21,933 Reinsurance and other recoverables 2,742 46 798 3,586 Beginning liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net 12,531 2,037 3,779 18,347 Provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Current accident year before catastrophes 3,582 2,707 1 6,290 Current accident year catastrophes 78 228 306 Prior accident years (394 ) (33 ) 241 (186 ) Total provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,266 2,902 242 6,410 Payments (3,316 ) (2,841 ) (390 ) (6,547 ) Ending liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net 12,481 2,098 3,631 18,210 Reinsurance and other recoverables 2,570 11 860 3,441 Ending liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, gross $ 15,051 $ 2,109 $ 4,491 $ 21,651 Earned premiums $ 5,903 $ 3,959 Loss and loss expense paid ratio [1] 56.2 71.8 Loss and loss expense incurred ratio 55.3 73.3 Prior accident years development (pts) [2] (6.7 ) (0.8 ) [1] The loss and loss expense paid ratio represents the ratio of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums.

Prior accident years development recorded in 2009 Included within prior accident years development for the year ended December 31, 2009 were the following reserve strengthenings (releases): For the year ended December 31, 2009 Property & Casualty Consumer Corporate and Total Property and Commercial Markets Other Casualty Insurance Auto liability $ (47 ) $ (77 ) $ $ (124 ) Professional liability (127 ) (127 ) General liability, umbrella and high hazard liability (112 ) (112 ) Workers compensation (92 ) (92 ) Package business 38 38 Fidelity and surety 28 28 Homeowners 18 18 Net environmental reserves 75 75 Net asbestos reserves 138 138 All other non-A&E within Other Operations 35 35 Uncollectible reinsurance (20 ) (20 ) (40 ) Discount accretion on workers compensation 24 24 Catastrophes (23 ) (23 ) Other reserve re-estimates, net (63 ) 26 13 (24 ) Total prior accident years development $ (394 ) $ (33 ) $ 241 $ (186 ) During 2009, the Company re-estimates of prior accident years reserves included the following significant reserve changes: Released reserves for personal auto liability claims, as in the beginning in the first quarter of 2008, management observed an improvement in emerged claim severity for the 2005 through 2007 accident years attributed, in part, to changes made in claim handling procedures in 2007. During 2009, the Company recognized that favorable development in reported severity was a sustained trend for those accident years and, accordingly, management reduced its reserve estimate. In the third and fourth quarters of 2009, management also recognized sustained favorable development trends in AARP for accident years 2006 to 2008 and released reserves for those accident years. Released reserves for commercial auto liability claims, primarily related to accident years 2003 to 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recognized that the full value of large auto liability claims was being recognized as case reserves at an earlier age. The increased adequacy of case reserves caused the Company to decrease its estimate of reserves for IBNR loss and loss adjustment expenses. 43 Table of Contents While the Company expects its losses from the sub-prime mortgage and credit crisis, as well as its exposure to the Madoff and Stanford cases to be manageable, there is nonetheless the risk that claims under professional liability, otherwise known as directors and officers ( D&O ) and errors and omissions ( E&O ), insurance policies incurred in the 2007 and 2008 accident years may develop adversely as the claims are settled. However, so far, the Company has seen no evidence of adverse loss experience related to these events. In fact, reported losses to date for claims under D&O and E&O policies for the 2007 accident year have been emerging favorably to initial expectations. In addition, for the 2003 to 2006 accident years, reported losses for claims under D&O and E&O policies have been emerging favorably to initial expectations due to lower than expected claim severity. The Company released reserves for D&O and E&O claims in 2009 related to the 2003 to 2008 accident years. Any continued favorable emergence of claims under D&O and E&O insurance policies for the 2008 and prior accident years could lead the Company to reduce reserves for these liabilities in future quarters. Released reserves for general liability claims, primarily related to accident years 2003 to 2007. Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, the Company observed that reported losses for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims, primarily related to the 2001 to 2006 accident years, were emerging favorably and this caused management to reduce its estimate of the cost of future reported claims for these accident years, resulting in a reserve release in each quarter since the third quarter of 2007. During 2009, management determined that the lower level of loss emergence was also evident in accident year 2007 and had continued for accident years 2003 to 2006 and, as a result, the Company reduced the reserves. In addition, during the third quarter of 2009, the Company recognized that the cost of late emerging exposures were likely to be higher than previously expected. Also in the third quarter, the Company recognized additional ceded losses on accident years 1999 and prior. These third quarter events were largely offsetting. Released workers compensation reserves, primarily related to additional ceded losses on accident years 1999 and prior and lower allocated loss adjustment expense reserves in accident years 2003 to 2007. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company observed lower than expected allocated loss adjustment expense payments on older accident years. As a result, the Company reduced its estimate for future expense payments on more recent accident years. Strengthened reserves for liability claims under package policies, primarily related to allocated loss adjustment expenses for accident years 2000 to 2005 and 2007 and 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company identified higher than expected expense payments on older accident years related to the liability coverage. Additional analysis in the second quarter of 2009 showed that this higher level of loss adjustment expense is likely to continue into more recent accident years. As a result, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company increased its estimates for future expense payments for the 2007 and 2008 accident years. In addition, during the third quarter of 2009, the Company recognized the cost of late emerging exposures were likely to be higher than previously expected. Also in the third quarter, the Company recognized a lower than expected frequency of high severity claims. These third quarter events were largely offsetting. Strengthened reserves for surety business, primarily related to accident years 2004 to 2007. The net strengthening consisted of $55 strengthening of reserves for customs bonds, partially offset by a $27 release of reserves for contract surety claims. During 2008, the Company became aware that there were a large number of late reported surety claims related to customs bonds. Continued high volume of late reported claims during 2009 caused the Company to strengthen the reserves. Because the pattern of claim reporting for customs bonds has not been similar to the reporting pattern of other surety bonds, future claim activity is difficult to predict. It is possible that as additional claim activity emerges, our estimate of both the number of future claims and the cost of those claims could change substantially. Strengthened reserves for property in personal homeowners claims, primarily driven by increased claim settlement costs in recent accident years and increased losses from underground storage tanks in older accident years. In 2008, the Company began to observe increasing claim settlement costs for the 2005 to 2008 accident years and, in the first quarter of 2009, determined that this higher cost level would continue, resulting in reserve strengthening for these accident years. In addition, beginning in 2008, the Company observed unfavorable emergence of homeowners casualty claims for accident years 2003 and prior, primarily related to underground storage tanks. Following a detailed review of these claims in the first quarter of 2009, management increased its estimate of the magnitude of this exposure and strengthened homeowners casualty claim reserves. The Company reviewed its allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for Property & Casualty Commercial in the second quarter of 2009 and reduced its allowance for Property & Casualty Commercial driven, in part, by a reduction in gross ceded loss recoverables. Refer to the Other Operations Claims section for further discussion concerning the Company annual evaluations of net environmental and net asbestos reserves, and related reinsurance. 44 Table of Contents A roll-forward follows of property and casualty insurance product liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008: For the year ended December 31, 2008 Total Property & Property and Casualty Consumer Corporate and Casualty Commercial Markets Other Insurance Beginning liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, gross $ 15,020 2,065 5,068 22,153 Reinsurance and other recoverables 2,917 67 938 3,922 Beginning liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net 12,103 1,998 4,130 18,231 Provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Current accident year before catastrophes 3,835 2,552 3 6,390 Current accident year catastrophes 285 258 543 Prior accident years (298 ) (52 ) 124 (226 ) Total provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,822 2,758 127 6,707 Payments (3,394 ) (2,719 ) (478 ) (6,591 ) Ending liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net 12,531 2,037 3,779 18,347 Reinsurance and other recoverables 2,742 46 798 3,586 Ending liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, gross $ 15,273 $ 2,083 $ 4,577 $ 21,933 Earned premiums $ 6,395 $ 3,935 Loss and loss expense paid ratio [1] 53.0 69.1 Loss and loss expense incurred ratio 59.8 70.1 Prior accident years development (pts) [2] (4.7 ) (1.3 ) [1] The loss and loss expense paid ratio represents the ratio of paid losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums. [2] Prior accident years development (pts) represents the ratio of prior accident years development to earned premiums. Current accident year catastrophes For 2008, net current accident year catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled $543, of which $237 related to hurricane Ike. In addition to the $237 of net catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses from hurricane Ike, the Company incurred $20 of assessments due to hurricane Ike. The following table shows total current accident year catastrophe impacts in the year ended December 31, 2008: For the year ended December 31, 2008 Property & Casualty Consumer Corporate and Total Property and Commercial Markets Other Casualty Insurance Gross incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses for current accident year catastrophes $ 312 $ 260 $ $ 572 Ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses for current accident year catastrophes 27 2 29 Net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses for current accident year catastrophes 285 258 543 Assessments owed to Texas Windstorm Insurance Association due to hurricane Ike 10 10 20 Reinstatement premium ceded to reinsurers due to hurricane Ike 1 1 Total current accident year catastrophe impacts $ 295 $ 269 $ $ 564 A portion of the gross incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses are recoverable from reinsurers under the Company principal catastrophe reinsurance program in addition to other reinsurance programs. Reinsurance recoveries under the Company principal catastrophe reinsurance program, which covers multiple lines of business, are allocated to the segments in accordance with a pre-established methodology that is consistent with the method used to allocate the ceded premium to each segment. The Company estimate of ultimate loss and loss expenses arising from hurricanes and other catastrophes is based on covered losses under the terms of the policies. The Company does not provide residential flood insurance on its homeowners policies so the Company estimate of hurricane losses on homeowners business does not include any provision for damages arising from flood waters. The Company acts as an administrator for the Write Your Own flood program on behalf of the National Flood Insurance Program under FEMA, for which it earns a fee for collecting premiums and processing claims. Under the program, the Company services both personal lines and commercial lines flood insurance policies and does not assume any underwriting risk. As a result, catastrophe losses in the above table do not include any losses related to the Write Your Own flood program. 45 Table of Contents Prior accident years development recorded in 2008 Included within prior accident years development for the year ended December 31, 2008 were the following reserve strengthenings (releases): For the year ended December 31, 2008 Property & Casualty Consumer Corporate and Total Property and Commercial Markets Other Casualty Insurance Auto liability $ (27 ) $ (46 ) $ $ (73 ) Workers compensation (156 ) (156 ) General liability, umbrella and high hazard liability (105 ) (105 ) General liability and products liability 67 67 Professional liability (75 ) (75 ) Extra-contractual liability claims under non-standard personal auto policies (24 ) (24 ) Construction defect claims (10 ) (10 ) National account general liability allocated loss adjustment expense reserves 25 25 Net environmental reserves 53 53 Net asbestos reserves 50 50 Discount accretion on workers compensation 26 26 Catastrophes (27 ) (27 ) Other reserve re-estimates, net (16 ) 18 21 23 Total prior accident years development $ (298 ) $ (52 ) $ 124 $ (226 ) During 2008, the Company re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes: Released commercial auto liability reserves, primarily related to accident years 2002 to 2007. Management has observed fewer than previously expected large losses in accident years 2006 and 2007 and lower than previously expected severity on large claims in accident years 2002 to 2005. In 2008, management recognized that favorable development in reported claim severity was a sustained trend and, accordingly, management reduced its estimate of the reserves. Released reserves for personal auto liability claims, principally related to AARP business for the 2005 through 2007 accident years. Beginning in the first quarter of 2008, management observed an improvement in emerged claim severity for the 2005 through 2007 accident years attributed, in part, to changes made in claim handling procedures in 2007. In the third and fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized that favorable development in reported severity was a sustained trend and, accordingly, management reduced its reserve estimate. Released workers compensation reserves primarily related to accident years 2000 to 2007. These reserve releases are a continuation of favorable developments first recognized in 2005 and recognized in both 2006 and 2007. The reserve releases in 2008 resulted from a determination that workers compensation losses continue to develop even more favorably from prior expectations due, in part, to state legal reforms, including in California and Florida, and underwriting actions as well as cost reduction initiatives first instituted in 2003. In particular, the state legal reforms and underwriting actions have resulted in lower than expected medical claim severity. Released reserves for general liability claims primarily related to the 2001 to 2007 accident years. Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, the Company observed that reported losses for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims, primarily related to the 2001 to 2006 accident years, were emerging favorably and this caused management to reduce its estimate of the cost of future reported claims for these accident years, resulting in a reserve release in each quarter since the third quarter of 2007. During 2008, the Company observed that this favorable trend continued with the 2007 accident year. The number of reported claims for this line of business has been lower than expected, a trend first observed in 2005. Over time, management has come to believe that the lower than expected number of claims reported to date will not be offset by a higher than expected number of late reported claims. Strengthened reserves for general liability and products liability claims primarily for accident years 2004 and prior for losses expected to emerge after 20 years of development. In 2007, management observed that long outstanding general liability claims have been settling for more than previously anticipated and, during the first quarter of 2008, the Company increased the estimate of late development of general liability claims. Released reserves for professional liability claims for accident years 2003 to 2006. During 2008, the Company updated its analysis of certain professional liability claims and the new analysis showed that claim severity for directors and officers losses in the 2003 to 2006 accident years were favorable to previous expectations, resulting in a reduction of reserves. The analysis also showed favorable emergence of claim severity on errors and omission policy claims for the 2004 and 2005 accident years, resulting in a release of reserves. 46 Table of Contents Released reserves for extra-contractual liability claims under non-standard personal auto policies. As part of the agreement to sell its non-standard auto insurance business in November, 2006, the Company continues to be obligated for certain extra-contractual liability claims arising prior to the date of sale. Reserve estimates for extra-contractual liability claims are subject to significant variability depending on the expected settlement of individually large claims and, during 2008, the Company determined that the settlement value of a number of these claims was expected to be less than previously anticipated, resulting in a $24 release of reserves. Released reserves for construction defect claims for accident years 2005 and prior due to lower than expected reported claim activity. Lower than expected claim activity was first noted in the first quarter of 2007 and continued throughout 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, management determined that this was a verifiable trend and reduced reserves accordingly. Strengthened reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses on national account general liability claims. Allocated loss adjustment expense reserves on general liability excess and umbrella claims were strengthened for accident years 2004 and prior as the Company observed that the cost of settling these claims has exceeded previous expectations. Refer to the Other Operations Claims section for further discussion concerning the Company annual evaluations of net environmental and net asbestos reserves, and related reinsurance. 47 Table of Contents Other Operations Claims Reserve Activity Reserves and reserve activity in the Other Operations operating segment, within Corporate and Other, are categorized and reported as asbestos, environmental, or all other . The all other category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, molestation and other long-tail liabilities. The following table presents reserve activity, inclusive of estimates for both reported and incurred but not reported claims, net of reinsurance, for Other Operations, categorized by asbestos, environmental and all other claims, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Other Operations Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Asbestos Environmental All Other [1] Total 2010 Beginning liability net [2] [3] $ 1,892 $ 307 $ 1,432 $ 3,631 Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 189 67 (5 ) 251 Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid (294 ) (40 ) (125 ) (459 ) Ending liability net [2] [3] $ 1,787 [4] $ 334 $ 1,302 $ 3,423 2009 Beginning liability net [2] [3] $ 1,884 $ 269 $ 1,628 $ 3,781 Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 138 75 29 242 Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid (181 ) (40 ) (171 ) (392 ) Reclassification of asbestos and environmental liabilities 51 3 (54 ) Ending liability net [2] [3] $ 1,892 $ 307 $ 1,432 $ 3,631 2008 Beginning liability net [2] [3] $ 1,998 $ 251 $ 1,888 $ 4,137 Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 68 54 7 129 Losses and loss adjustment expenses paid (182 ) (36 ) (267 ) (485 ) Ending liability net [2] [3] $ 1,884 $ 269 $ 1,628 $ 3,781 [1] All Other includes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. All Other also includes The Company allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. When the Company commutes a ceded reinsurance contract or settles a ceded reinsurance dispute, the portion of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance attributable to that commutation or settlement, if any, is reclassified to the appropriate cause of loss. [2] Excludes amounts reported in Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets reporting segments for asbestos and environmental net liabilities of $11 and $5, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, $10 and $5, respectively, as of December 31, 2009, and $12 and $6, respectively, as of December 31, 2008; total net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $15, $16 and $16, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims; and total net losses and loss adjustment expenses paid for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $14, $19 and $13, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims. [3] Gross of reinsurance, asbestos and environmental reserves, including liabilities in Property & Casualty Commercial and Commercial Markets, were $2,308 and $378, respectively, as of December 31, 2010; $2,484 and $367, respectively, as of December 31, 2009; and $2,498 and $309, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. [4] The one year and average three year net paid amounts for asbestos claims, including Ongoing Operations, were $300 and $227, respectively, resulting in a one year net survival ratio of 6.0 and a three year net survival ratio of 7.9. Net survival ratio is the quotient of the net carried reserves divided by the average annual payment amount and is an indication of the number of years that the net carried reserve would last (i.e. survive) if the future annual claim payments were consistent with the calculated historical average. For paid and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reporting, the Company classifies its asbestos and environmental reserves into three categories: Direct, Assumed Reinsurance and London Market. Direct insurance includes primary and excess coverage. Assumed reinsurance includes both treaty reinsurance (covering broad categories of claims or blocks of business) and facultative reinsurance (covering specific risks or individual policies of primary or excess insurance companies). London Market business includes the business written by one or more of the Company subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, which are no longer active in the insurance or reinsurance business. Such business includes both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. Of the three categories of claims (Direct, Assumed Reinsurance and London Market), direct policies tend to have the greatest factual development from which to estimate the Company exposures. Assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance exposures because the Company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct insurance claim is mature. This causes a delay in the receipt of information at the reinsurer level and adds to the uncertainty of estimating related reserves. London Market exposures are the most uncertain of the three categories of claims. As a participant in the London Market (comprised of both Lloyd of London and London Market companies), certain subsidiaries of the Company wrote business on a subscription basis, with those subsidiaries involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage of a total contract placement. Claims are reported, via a broker, to the lead underwriter and, once agreed to, are presented to the following markets for concurrence. This reporting and claim agreement process makes estimating liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three categories of claims. 48 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, paid and incurred loss activity by the three categories of claims for asbestos and environmental. Paid and Incurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses ( LAE ) Development Asbestos and Environmental Asbestos [1] Environmental [1] Paid Incurred Paid Incurred Losses & LAE Losses & LAE Losses & LAE Losses & LAE 2010 Gross Direct $ 201 $ 209 $ 35 $ 50 Assumed Reinsurance 128 12 5 London Market 42 (15 ) 7 10 Total 371 194 54 65 Ceded (77 ) (5 ) (14 ) 2 Net $ 294 $ 189 $ 40 $ 67 2009 Gross Direct $ 160 $ 117 $ 29 $ 92 Assumed Reinsurance 56 52 7 London Market 18 10 12 Total 234 169 46 104 Ceded (53 ) (31 ) (6 ) (29 ) Net prior to reclassification 181 138 40 75 Reclassification of asbestos and environmental liabilities [2] 51 3 Net $ 181 $ 189 $ 40 $ 78 2008 Gross Direct $ 207 $ 76 $ 32 $ 69 Assumed Domestic 61 9 (17 ) London Market 19 6 13 Total 287 76 47 65 Ceded (105 ) (8 ) (11 ) (11 ) Net $ 182 $ 68 $ 36 $ 54 [1] Excludes asbestos and environmental paid and incurred loss and LAE reported in Property & Casualty Commercial. Total gross losses and LAE incurred in Property & Casualty Commercial for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes $15, $17 and $15, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims. Total gross losses and LAE paid in Property & Casualty Commercial for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes $14, $20 and $12, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims. [2] During the three months ended June 30, 2009, the Company reclassified liabilities of $54 that were previously classified as All Other to Asbestos and Environmental . In the fourth quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company completed evaluations of certain of its non-asbestos and environmental reserves, including its assumed reinsurance liabilities. Based on this evaluation in 2010, the Company recognized unfavorable prior year development of $11. In 2009, the Company recognized unfavorable prior year development of $35, principally driven by higher projected unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The Company recognized favorable prior year development of $30 in 2008 for its HartRe assumed reinsurance liabilities principally driven by lower than expected reported losses. In 2008, the favorable HartRe assumed reinsurance prior year development was offset by unfavorable other non-asbestos and environmental prior year development of $30, including $25 of adverse development for assumed reinsurance obligations of the Company Bermuda operations. During the third quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company completed its annual ground up environmental reserve evaluations. In each of these evaluations, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to environmental liability as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and its London Market exposures for both direct and assumed reinsurance. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company found estimates for some individual accounts increased based upon unfavorable litigation results and increased clean-up or expense costs, with the vast majority of this deterioration emanating from a limited number of insureds. In 2009, the Company found estimates for some individual accounts increased based upon additional sites identified, litigation developments and new damage and defense cost information obtained on these accounts since the last review. In 2008, the Company found that the decline in the reporting of new accounts and sites has been slower than anticipated in the previous review. The net effect of these account-specific changes as well as actuarial evaluations of new account emergence and historical loss and expense paid experience resulted in $62, $75 and $53 increases in net environmental liabilities in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company currently expects to continue to perform an evaluation of its environmental liabilities annually. 49 Table of Contents In reporting environmental results, the Company classifies its gross exposure into Direct, Assumed Reinsurance, and London Market. The following table displays gross environmental reserves and other statistics by category as of December 31, 2010. Summary of Environmental Reserves As of December 31, 2010 Total Reserves Gross [1] [2] Direct $ 273 Assumed Reinsurance 47 London Market 58 Total 378 Ceded (39 ) Net $ 339 [1] The one year gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $61, resulting in a one year gross survival ratio of 6.2. [2] The three year average gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $56, resulting in a three year gross survival ratio of 6.8. During the second quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company completed its annual ground-up asbestos reserve evaluations. As part of these evaluations, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and its London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. Based on this evaluation, the Company increased its net asbestos reserves by $169 in second quarter 2010. During 2010 and 2009, for certain direct policyholders, the Company experienced increases in claim severity and expense. Increases in severity and expense were driven by litigation in certain jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, development on primarily peripheral accounts. The Company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. The net effect of these changes in 2009 resulted in a $138 increase in net asbestos reserves. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the particular circumstances of each account. These changes were case specific and not as a result of any underlying change in the current environment. The net effect of these changes resulted in a $50 increase in net asbestos reserves. The Company currently expects to continue to perform an evaluation of its asbestos liabilities annually. The Company classifies its gross asbestos exposures into Direct, Assumed Reinsurance and London Market. The Company further classifies its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories: Major Asbestos Defendants (the Top 70 accounts in Tillinghast published Tiers 1 and 2 and Wellington accounts), which are subdivided further as: Structured Settlements, Wellington, Other Major Asbestos Defendants, Accounts with Future Expected Exposures greater than $2.5, Accounts with Future Expected Exposures less than $2.5, and Unallocated. Structured Settlements are those accounts where the Company has reached an agreement with the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured. The Wellington subcategory includes insureds that entered into the Wellington Agreement dated June 19, 1985. The Wellington Agreement provided terms and conditions for how the signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers. The Other Major Asbestos Defendants subcategory represents insureds included in Tiers 1 and 2, as defined by Tillinghast that are not Wellington signatories and have not entered into structured settlements with The Hartford. The Tier 1 and 2 classifications are meant to capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos claims. Accounts with future expected exposures greater or less than $2.5 include accounts that are not major asbestos defendants. The Unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the Company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. For example, an account with future expected exposure of greater than $2.5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to changing conditions and recategorized as less than $2.5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa. 50 Table of Contents The following table displays gross asbestos reserves and other statistics by policyholder category as of December 31, 2010. Summary of Gross Asbestos Reserves As of December 31, 2010 Number of All Time Total All Time Accounts [2] Paid [3] Reserves Ultimate [3] Gross Asbestos Reserves as of June 30, 2010 [1] Major asbestos defendants [5] Structured settlements (includes 4 Wellington accounts) [6] 7 $ 312 $ 428 $ 740 Wellington (direct only) 29 908 44 952 Other major asbestos defendants 29 476 132 608 No known policies (includes 3 Wellington accounts) 5 Accounts with future exposure > $2.5 77 832 585 1,417 Accounts with future exposure < $2.5 1,122 409 133 542 Unallocated [7] 1,766 446 2,212 Total Direct 4,703 1,768 6,471 Assumed Reinsurance 1,199 469 1,668 London Market 605 308 913 Total as of June 30, 2010 [1] 6,507 2,545 9,052 Gross paid loss activity for the third quarter and fourth quarter 2010 242 (242 ) Gross incurred loss activity for the third quarter and fourth quarter 2010 5 5 Total as of December 31, 2010 [4] $ 6,749 $ 2,308 $ 9,057 [1] Gross Asbestos Reserves based on the second quarter 2010 asbestos reserve study. [2] An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. Reclassifications were made as a result of the reserve evaluation completed in the second quarter of 2010. [3] All Time Paid represents the total payments with respect to the indicated claim type that have already been made by the Company as of the indicated balance sheet date. All Time Ultimate represents the Company estimate, as of the indicated balance sheet date, of the total payments that are ultimately expected to be made to fully settle the indicated payment type. The amount is the sum of the amounts already paid (e.g. All Time Paid ) and the estimated future payments (e.g. the amount shown in the column labeled Total Reserves ). [4] Survival ratio is a commonly used industry ratio for comparing reserve levels between companies. While the method is commonly used, it is not a predictive technique. Survival ratios may vary over time for numerous reasons such as large payments due to the final resolution of certain asbestos liabilities, or reserve re-estimates. The survival ratio is computed by dividing the recorded reserves by the average of the past three years of payments. The ratio is the calculated number of years the recorded reserves would survive if future annual payments were equal to the average annual payments for the past three years. The 3-year gross survival ratio of 7.5 as of December 31, 2010 is computed based on total paid losses of $917 for the period from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the one year gross paid amount for total asbestos claims is $378 resulting in a one year gross survival ratio of 6.1. [5] Includes 25 open accounts at June 30, 2010. Included 25 open accounts at June 30, 2009. [6] Structured settlements include the Company reserves related to PPG Industries, Inc. ( PPG ). In January 2009, the Company, along with approximately three dozen other insurers, entered into a modified agreement in principle with PPG to resolve the Company coverage obligations for all of its PPG asbestos liabilities, including principally those arising out of its 50% stock ownership of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation ( PCC ), a joint venture with Corning, Inc. The agreement is contingent on the fulfillment of certain conditions, including the confirmation of a PCC plan of reorganization under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, which have not yet been met. [7] Includes closed accounts (exclusive of Major Asbestos Defendants) and unallocated IBNR. The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers unwillingness or inability to pay. During the second quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company completed its annual evaluations of the collectability of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Other Operations segment. In conducting this evaluation, the Company used its most recent detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment. The Company analyzed the overall credit quality of the Company reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers, and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. The evaluation in the second quarter of 2010 resulted in no addition to the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. As of December 31, 2010, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for Other Operations totals $211. As a result of the second quarter of 2009 evaluation, the Company reduced its allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by $20 principally to reflect decreased reinsurance recoverable dispute exposure and favorable activity since the last evaluation. The evaluation in the second quarter of 2008 resulted in no addition to the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The Company currently expects to perform its regular comprehensive review of Other Operations reinsurance recoverables annually. Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, particularly for older, long-term casualty liabilities, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required. Consistent with the Company long-standing reserving practices, the Company will continue to review and monitor its reserves in the Other Operations segment regularly and, where future developments indicate, make appropriate adjustments to the reserves. 51 Table of Contents Impact of Re-estimates The establishment of property and casualty insurance product reserves is an estimation process, using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. Ultimate losses may vary significantly from the current estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels. Subsequent changes can generally be thought of as being the result of the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and/or changes in interpretations of information and trends. The table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the past ten years. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves, net of reinsurance. The percentage relationships presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last ten years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability. See Impact of key assumptions on reserve volatility within this section for further discussion of the potential for variability in recorded loss reserves. Property & Casualty Consumer Corporate and Total Property and Commercial Markets Other Casualty Insurance Range of prior accident year unfavorable (favorable) development for the ten years ended December 31, 2010 [1] [2] (3.1) 1.5 (5.2) 5.1 2.9 67.5 (1.2) 21.5 [1] Excluding the reserve strengthening for asbestos and environmental reserves, over the past ten years reserve re-estimates for total property and casualty insurance ranged from (3.0)% to 1.6%. [2] Development for Corporate is included in Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets in 2007 and prior. The potential variability of the Company property and casualty insurance product reserves would normally be expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments. Illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are discussed above. A table depicting the historical development of the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, follows.

Those amounts are comprised of changes in estimates of gross losses and changes in estimates of related reinsurance recoveries. The table below, for the periods presented, reconciles the net reserves to the gross reserves, as initially estimated and recorded, and as currently estimated and recorded, and computes the cumulative deficiency (redundancy) of the Company reserves before reinsurance.

The following table is derived from the Loss Development table and summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2010. The total of each column details the amount of reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates during the ten year period ended December 31, 2010 for the indicated accident year(s).

This reclassification of reserves by accident year had no effect on total recorded reserves within any segment or on total recorded reserves for any line of business within a segment. Reserve changes for accident years 2000 & Prior The largest impacts of net reserve re-estimates are shown in the 2000 & Prior accident years. Reserve deterioration was related to calendar years, driven, in part, by deterioration of reserves for assumed casualty reinsurance and workers compensation claims. Numerous actuarial assumptions on assumed casualty reinsurance turned out to be low, including loss cost trends, particularly on excess of loss business, and the impact of deteriorating terms and conditions. Workers compensation reserves also deteriorated, as medical inflation trends were above initial expectations. The reserve re-estimates in calendar year 2003 include an increase in reserves of $2.6 billion related to reserve strengthening based on the Company evaluation of its asbestos reserves. The reserve evaluation that led to the strengthening in calendar year 2003 confirmed the Company view of the existence of a substantial long-term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment. The reserve re-estimates in calendar years 2004 and 2006 were largely attributable to reductions in the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities. 53 Table of Contents Reserve changes for accident years 2001 and 2002 Accident years 2001 and 2002 are reasonably close to original estimates. However, each year shows some swings by calendar period, with some favorable development prior to calendar year 2005, largely offset by unfavorable development in calendar years 2005 through 2008. The release for accident year 2001 during calendar year 2004 relates primarily to reserves for the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Subsequent adverse developments on accident year 2001 relate to assumed casualty reinsurance and unexpected development on mature claims in both general liability and workers compensation. Reserve releases for accident year 2002 during calendar years 2003 and 2004 come largely from short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly and actual reported losses are predictive of ultimate losses. Reserve increases on accident year 2002 during calendar year 2005 were recognized, as unfavorable development on accident years prior to 2002 caused the Company to increase its estimate of unpaid losses for the 2002 accident year. Reserve changes for accident years 2003 through 2009 Even after considering the 2007 calendar year reclassification of $347 of IBNR reserves from the 2003 to 2006 accident years to the 2002 and prior accident years, accident years 2003 through 2007 show favorable development in calendar years 2004 through 2010. A portion of the release comes from short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly. During calendar year 2005 and 2006, favorable re-estimates occurred for both loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses. In addition, catastrophe reserves related to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes developed favorably in 2006. During calendar years 2005 through 2008, the Company recognized favorable re-estimates of both loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses on workers compensation claims driven, in part, by state legal reforms, including in California and Florida, underwriting actions and expense reduction initiatives that have had a greater impact in controlling costs than was originally estimated. In 2007, the Company released reserves for package business claims as reported losses have emerged favorably to previous expectations. In 2007 through 2009, the Company released reserves for general liability claims due to the favorable emergence of losses for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims. Reserves for professional liability claims were released in 2008 and 2009 related to the 2003 through 2007 accident years due to a lower estimate of claim severity on both directors and officers insurance claims and errors and omissions insurance claims. Reserves of auto liability claims, within Consumer Markets, were released in 2008 due largely to an improvement in emerged claim severity for the 2005 to 2007 accident years. 54 Table of Contents Estimated Gross Profits Used in the Valuation and Amortization of Assets and Liabilities Associated with Variable Annuity and Other Universal Life-Type Contracts Estimated gross profits ( EGPs ) are used in the amortization of the DAC asset, which includes the present value of future profits; sales inducement assets ( SIA ); and unearned revenue reserves ( URR ). See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on DAC. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on SIA. Portions of EGPs are also used in the valuation of reserves for death and other insurance benefit features on variable annuity and universal life-type contracts. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on death and other insurance benefit reserves. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 the most significant EGP based balances that are amortized were as follows: U.S. Annuity International Annuity Retirement Plans Life Insurance 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 DAC $ 3,251 $ 3,114 $ 1,617 $ 1,693 $ 820 $ 701 $ 2,667 $ 2,490 SIA $ 329 $ 324 $ 41 $ 28 $ 23 $ 23 $ 45 $ 42 URR $ 99 $ 96 $ 43 $ 70 $ $ $ 1,383 $ 1,182 Death and Other Insurance Benefit Reserves $ 1,052 $ 1,232 $ 696 $ 584 $ 1 $ 1 $ 113 $ 76 For most contracts, the Company estimates gross profits over 20 years as EGPs emerging subsequent to that timeframe are immaterial. Products sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits for each cohort are projected over the estimated lives of the underlying contracts, based on future account value projections for variable annuity and variable universal life products. The projection of future account values requires the use of certain assumptions including: separate account returns; separate account fund mix; fees assessed against the contract holder account balance; surrender and lapse rates; interest margin; mortality; and hedging costs. Changes in these assumptions and, in addition, changes to other policyholder behavior assumptions such as resets, partial surrenders, reaction to price increases, and asset allocations causes EGPs to fluctuate which impacts earnings. Prior to the second quarter of 2009, the Company determined EGPs using the mean derived from stochastic scenarios that had been calibrated to the estimated separate account return. The Company also completed a comprehensive assumption study, in the third quarter of each year, and revised best estimate assumptions used to estimate future gross profits when the EGPs in the Company models fell outside of an independently determined reasonable range of EGPs. The Company also considered, on a quarterly basis, other qualitative factors such as product, regulatory and policyholder behavior trends and would revise EGPs if those trends were expected to be significant. Beginning with the second quarter of 2009, the Company now determines EGPs from a single deterministic reversion to mean ( RTM ) separate account return projection which is an estimation technique commonly used by insurance entities to project future separate account returns. Through this estimation technique, the Company DAC model is adjusted to reflect actual account values at the end of each quarter. Through consideration of recent market returns, the Company will unlock, or adjust, projected returns over a future period so that the account value returns to the long-term expected rate of return, providing that those projected returns do not exceed certain caps or floors. This DAC Unlock for future separate account returns is determined each quarter. Under RTM, the expected long term weighted average rate of return is 8.3% and 5.9% for U.S. and Japan, respectively. In the third quarter of each year, the Company completes a comprehensive non-market related policyholder behavior assumption study and incorporates the results of those studies into its projection of future gross profits. Additionally, throughout the year, the Company evaluates various aspects of policyholder behavior and periodically revises its policyholder assumptions as credible emerging data indicates that changes are warranted. Upon completion of the assumption study or evaluation of credible new information, the Company will revise its assumptions to reflect its current best estimate. These assumption revisions will change the projected account values and the related EGPs in the DAC, SIA and URR amortization models, as well as the death and other insurance benefit reserving model. All assumption changes that affect the estimate of future EGPs including the update of current account values, the use of the RTM estimation technique and policyholder behavior assumptions are considered an Unlock in the period of revision. An Unlock adjusts DAC, SIA, URR and death and other insurance benefit reserve balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with an offsetting benefit or charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the revision. An Unlock that results in an after-tax benefit generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being favorable compared to previous estimates. An Unlock that results in an after-tax charge generally occurs as a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being unfavorable compared to previous estimates. EGPs are also used to determine the expected excess benefits and assessments included in the measurement of death and other insurance benefit reserves. These excess benefits and assessments are derived from a range of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to the Company RTM separate account returns. The determination of death and other insurance benefit reserves is also impacted by discount rates, lapses, volatilities and mortality assumptions. 55 Table of Contents An Unlock revises EGPs, on a quarterly basis, to reflect market updates of policyholder account value and the Company current best estimate assumptions. After each quarterly Unlock, the Company also tests the aggregate recoverability of DAC by comparing the DAC balance to the present value of future EGPs. The margin between the DAC balance and the present value of future EGPs for U.S. and Japan individual variable annuities was 29% and 38% as of December 31, 2010, respectively. If the margin between the DAC asset and the present value of future EGPs is exhausted, further reductions in EGPs would cause portions of DAC to be unrecoverable and the DAC asset would be written down to equal future EGPs. Unlocks The after-tax impact on the Company assets and liabilities as a result of the Unlocks for years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, were: For the year ended December 31, 2010: Death and Other Segment Insurance After-tax (Charge) Benefit DAC URR Benefit Reserves SIA Total Global Annuity $ 42 $ 7 $ 16 $ $ 65 Life Insurance 23 5 1 (1 ) 28 Retirement Plans 18 18 Total $ 83 $ 12 $ 17 $ (1 ) $ 111 The most significant contributors to the Unlock benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 were actual separate account returns being above our aggregated estimated return. Also included in the benefit are assumption updates related to benefits from withdrawals and lapses, offset by hedging, annuitization estimates on Japan products, and long-term expected rate of return updates. For the year ended December 31, 2009: Death and Other Segment Insurance After-tax (Charge) Benefit DAC URR Benefit Reserves SIA Total [1] Global Annuity $ (533 ) $ 23 $ (368 ) $ (46 ) $ (924 ) Life Insurance (101 ) 54 (4 ) (51 ) Retirement Plans (55 ) (1 ) (56 ) Corporate and Other (3 ) (3 ) Total $ (692 ) $ 77 $ (372 ) $ (47 ) $ (1,034 ) [1] Includes $(49) related to DAC recoverability impairment associated with the decision to suspend sales in the U.K variable annuity business. The most significant contributors to the Unlock was a result of actual separate account returns being significantly below our aggregated estimated return for the first quarter of 2009, partially offset by actual returns being greater than our aggregated estimated return for the period from April 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008: Death and Other Segment Insurance Benefit After-tax (Charge) Benefit DAC URR Reserves SIA Total Global Annuity $ (671 ) $ 17 $ (165 ) $ (29 ) $ (848 ) Life Insurance (29 ) (12 ) (3 ) (44 ) Retirement Plans (49 ) (49 ) Corporate and Other 9 9 Total $ (740 ) $ 5 $ (168 ) $ (29 ) $ (932 ) The most significant contributors to the Unlock was a result of actual separate account returns were significantly below our aggregated estimated return. Furthermore, the Company reduced its 20 year projected separate account return assumption from 7.8% to 7.2% in the U.S. In addition, Retirement Plans reduced its estimate of future fees as plans met contractual size limits ( breakpoints ), causing a lower fee schedule to apply, and the Company increased its assumption for future deposits by existing plan participants. Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities and Valuation Allowances on Investments The Company has a monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals that identifies investments that are subject to an enhanced evaluation on a quarterly basis to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment ( impairment ) is present for AFS securities or a valuation allowance is required for mortgage loans. This evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. For further discussion of the accounting policies, see the Significant Investment Accounting Policies Section in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of results, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Credit Risk section of the MD&A. 56 Table of Contents Living Benefits Required to be Fair Valued (in Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable ) Fair values for GMWB and GMAB contracts are calculated using the income approach based upon internally developed models because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. The fair value of the Company guaranteed benefit liabilities, classified as embedded derivatives, and the related reinsurance and customized freestanding derivatives is calculated as an aggregation of the following components: Best Estimate Claims Payments; Credit Standing Adjustment; and Margins. The resulting aggregation is reconciled or calibrated, if necessary, to market information that is, or may be, available to the Company, but may not be observable by other market participants, including reinsurance discussions and transactions. The Company believes the aggregation of these components, as necessary and as reconciled or calibrated to the market information available to the Company, results in an amount that the Company would be required to transfer, or receive, for an asset, to or from market participants in an active liquid market, if one existed, for those market participants to assume the risks associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits and the related reinsurance and customized derivatives. The fair value is likely to materially diverge from the ultimate settlement of the liability as the Company believes settlement will be based on our best estimate assumptions rather than those best estimate assumptions plus risk margins. In the absence of any transfer of the guaranteed benefit liability to a third party, the release of risk margins is likely to be reflected as realized gains in future periods net income. For further discussion on the impact of fair value changes from living benefits see Note 4a of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and for a discussion on the sensitivities of certain living benefits due to capital market factors see Variable Product Equity Risk within Capital Markets Risk Management. Goodwill Impairment Goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The goodwill impairment test follows a two step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. This allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Management determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of the Company own share price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Other assumptions include levels of economic capital, future business growth, earnings projections, assets under management for Wealth Management reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in the amount of economic capital allocated to a reporting unit, decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause the reporting unit fair value to decrease. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Most of the Company reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company operating segments as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics. In 2010, The Hartford has changed its reporting segments with no change to reporting units. The homeowners and automobile components of Consumer Markets have been aggregated into one reporting unit; the variable life, universal life and term life components within Life Insurance have been aggregated into one reporting unit of Individual Life; the 401(k), 457 and 403(b) components of Retirement Plans have been aggregated into one reporting unit; the retail mutual funds component of Mutual Funds has been aggregated into one reporting unit; and the group disability and group life components of Group Benefits have been aggregated into one reporting unit. In circumstances where the components of an operating segment constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component such as Hartford Financial Products, the Company has classified those components as reporting units. Goodwill associated with the June 30, 2000 buyback of Hartford Life, Inc. was allocated to each of Hartford Life reporting units based on the reporting units fair value of in-force business at the time of the buyback. Although this goodwill was allocated to each reporting unit, it is held in Corporate and Other for segment reporting. In addition Federal Trust Corporation is an immaterial operating segment where the goodwill has been included in the Corporate and Other. 57 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, the Company had goodwill allocated to the following reporting units: Segment Goodwill in Goodwill Corporate and Other Total Hartford Financial Products within Property & Casualty Commercial $ 30 $ $ 30 Group Benefits 138 138 Consumer Markets 119 119 Individual Life within Life Insurance 224 118 342 Retirement Plans 87 69 156 Mutual Funds 159 92 251 Federal Trust Corporation within Corporate and Other 15 15 Total $ 619 $ 432 $ 1,051 As of December 31, 2009, the Company had goodwill allocated to the following reporting units: Segment Goodwill in Goodwill Corporate and Other Total Hartford Financial Products within Property & Casualty Commercial $ 30 $ $ 30 Group Benefits 138 138 Consumer Markets 119 119 Individual Life within Life Insurance 224 118 342 Retirement Plans 87 69 156 Mutual Funds 159 92 251 Federal Trust Corporation within Corporate and Other 168 168 Total $ 619 $ 585 $ 1,204 The Company completed its annual goodwill assessment for the Federal Trust Corporation reporting unit within Corporate and Other during the second quarter of 2010, resulting in a goodwill impairment of $153, pre-tax. The Company completed its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within Wealth Management and Corporate and Other, except for the Federal Trust Corporation reporting unit, as of January 1, 2010, which resulted in no write-downs of goodwill in 2010. The reporting units passed the first step of their annual impairment tests with a significant margin with the exception of the Individual Life reporting unit within Life Insurance. Individual Life completed the second step of the annual goodwill impairment test resulting in an implied goodwill value that was in excess of its carrying value. Even though the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, the implied level of goodwill in Individual Life exceeded the carrying amount of goodwill. In the implied purchase accounting required by the step two goodwill impairment test, the implied present value of future profits was substantially lower than that of the DAC asset removed in purchase accounting. A higher discount rate was used for calculating the present value of future profits as compared to that used for calculating the present value of estimated gross profits for DAC. As a result, in the implied purchase accounting, implied goodwill exceeded the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of the Individual Life reporting unit within Life Insurance is based on discounted cash flows using earnings projections on in force business and future business growth. There could be a positive or negative impact on the result of step one in future periods if actual earnings or business growth assumptions emerge differently than those used in determining fair value for the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test. The annual goodwill assessment for the reporting units within Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets was completed during the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted in no write-downs of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2010. Consumer Markets passed the first step of its annual impairment test with a significant margin while the Hartford Financial Products reporting unit within Property & Casualty Commercial passed the first step of its annual impairment test with less than a 5% margin. The fair value of the Hartford Financial Products reporting unit is based on discounted cash flows using earnings projections on existing business and future business growth. To the extent that actual earnings or business growth assumptions emerge differently than those used in determining fair value for the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test, it could have a positive or negative impact on the results of step one in future periods. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the results of goodwill impairment tests performed in 2009 and 2008. 58 Table of Contents Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments The fair value of AFS securities, fixed maturities, at fair value using the fair value option ( FVO ), equity securities, trading, and short-term investments in an active and orderly market (i.e., not distressed or forced liquidation) is determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information: third-party pricing services, independent broker quotations or pricing matrices. Security pricing is applied using a waterfall approach whereby prices are first sought from third-party pricing services, the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers for prices, or lastly, securities are priced using a pricing matrix. Typical inputs used by these pricing methods include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids, offers, and/or estimated cash flows and prepayments speeds. Based on the typical trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities, third-party pricing services will normally derive the security prices through recent reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information as outlined above. If there are no recent reported trades, the third party pricing services and brokers may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate. For further discussion, see the Available-for-Sale, Fixed Maturities, FVO, Equity Securities, Trading, and Short-Term Investments Section in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has analyzed the third-party pricing services valuation methodologies and related inputs, and has also evaluated the various types of securities in its investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs. For further discussion of fair value measurement, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valuation of Derivative Instruments, excluding embedded derivatives within liability contracts and reinsurance related derivatives Derivative instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. Derivative instruments are fair valued using pricing valuation models, which utilize market data inputs or independent broker quotations. Excluding embedded and reinsurance related derivatives, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, 97% of derivatives based upon notional values, were priced by valuation models, which utilize independent market data. The remaining derivatives were priced by broker quotations. The derivatives are valued using mid-market level inputs that are predominantly observable in the market with the exception of the customized swap contracts that hedge guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWB ) liabilities. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, swap interest rates, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads and correlations, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels. The Company performs a monthly analysis on derivative valuations which includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, review of pricing statistics and trends, back testing recent trades, analyzing the impacts of changes in the market environment, and review of changes in market value for each derivative including those derivatives priced by brokers. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the Plan ) that covers substantially all employees, as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the Plan under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has also entered into individual retirement agreements with certain retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits. In addition, the Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The Company maintains international plans which represent an immaterial percentage of total pension assets, liabilities and expense and, for reporting purposes, are combined with domestic plans. Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company pension and other postretirement obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In determining the discount rate assumption, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company pension and other postretirement obligations and currently available market and industry data. The yield curve utilized in the cash flow analysis is comprised of bonds rated Aa or higher with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years. Based on all available information, it was determined that 5.50% and 5.25% were the appropriate discount rates as of December 31, 2010 to calculate the Company pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively. Accordingly, the 5.50% and 5.25% discount rates will also be used to determine the Company 2011 pension and other postretirement expense, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the discount rate was 6.00% and 5.75% for pension and other postretirement expense, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, a 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate would decrease/increase the pension and other postretirement obligations by $137 and $9, respectively. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return assumption based on an analysis of the Plan portfolio historical compound rates of return since 1979 (the earliest date for which comparable portfolio data is available) and over 5 year and 10 year periods. The Company selected these periods, as well as shorter durations, to assess the portfolio volatility, duration and total returns as they relate to pension obligation characteristics, which are influenced by the Company workforce demographics. In addition, the Company also applies long-term market return assumptions to an investment mix that generally anticipates 60% fixed income securities, 20% equity securities and 20% alternative assets to derive an expected long-term rate of return. Based upon these analyses, management maintained the long-term rate of return assumption at 7.30% as of December 31, 2010. This assumption will be used to determine the Company 2011 expense. The long-term rate of return assumption at December 31, 2009, that was used to determine the Company 2010 expense, was 7.30%. 59 Table of Contents Pension expense reflected in the Company results was $186, $137 and $122 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company estimates its 2011 pension expense will be approximately $210, based on current assumptions. To illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for 2011 and going forward, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate will increase pension expense by approximately $15 and a 25 basis point change in the long-term asset return assumption will increase/decrease pension expense by approximately $10. The Company uses a five-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of Plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses that result from returns that differ from the Company long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a five year period. The difference between actual asset returns for the plans of $434 and $184 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as compared to expected returns of $286 and $276 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, will be fully reflected in the market-related value of plan assets over the next five years using the methodology described above. The level of actuarial net loss continues to exceed the allowable amortization corridor. Based on the 5.50% discount rate selected as of December 31, 2010 and taking into account estimated future minimum funding, the difference between actual and expected performance in 2010 will decrease annual pension expense in future years. The decrease in pension expense will be approximately $7 in 2011 and will increase ratably to a decrease of approximately $50 in 2016. Valuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized if there is no change in tax law. Under U.S. GAAP, we test the value of deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis at the entity level within each tax jurisdiction, consistent with our filed tax returns. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of December 31, 2010, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine it is not more likely than not that we will be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions. The Company has recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. The deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $173 as of December 31, 2010 and $86 as of December 31, 2009. The increase in the valuation allowance during 2010 was triggered by the recognition of additional realized losses on investment securities which were incurred in the first quarter. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, and taxable income in prior carryback years, as well as tax planning strategies that include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, selling appreciated securities to offset capital losses, business considerations, such as asset-liability matching, and the sales of certain corporate assets, including a subsidiary. Such tax planning strategies are viewed by management as prudent and feasible and will be implemented if necessary to realize the deferred tax asset. Future economic conditions and debt market volatility, including increases in interest rates, can adversely impact the Company tax planning strategies and in particular the Company ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized realized capital losses. Contingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its best estimate, or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses. The Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. 60 Table of Contents THE HARTFORD S OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Hartford is a financial holding company for a group of subsidiaries that provide property and casualty and life insurance and investment products to both individual and business customers in the United States and continues to administer business previously sold in Japan and the U.K. The Company conducts business in three customer-oriented divisions, Commercial Markets, Consumer Markets and Wealth Management, each containing reporting segments. The Commercial Markets division consists of the reporting segments of Property & Casualty Commercial and Group Benefits. The Consumer Markets division is also the reporting segment. The Wealth Management division consists of the following reporting segments: Global Annuity, Life Insurance, Retirement Plans and Mutual Funds. For additional discussion regarding The Hartford reporting segments, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company derives its revenues principally from: (a) premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds; (b) fee income, including asset management fees, on separate account and mutual fund assets and mortality and expense fees, as well as cost of insurance charges; (c) net investment income; (d) fees earned for services provided to third parties; and (e) net realized capital gains and losses. Premiums charged for insurance coverages are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in-force. Asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily generated from separate account assets, which are deposited through the sale of variable annuity and variable universal life products and from mutual funds. Cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk for investment-oriented life insurance products. Service fees principally include revenues from third party claims administration services and revenues from member contact center services provided through the AARP Health program. Profitability of Commercial and Consumer Markets operations over time is greatly influenced by the Company underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance, the size of its in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the Company response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels. The Company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, the Company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments. The financial results in the Company variable annuity, mutual fund and, to a lesser extent, variable universal life businesses, depend largely on the amount of the contract holder account value or assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees charged. Changes in account value or assets under management are driven by two main factors: net flows, which measure the success of the Company asset gathering and retention efforts, and the market return of the funds, which is heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity markets. Net flows are comprised of new sales and other deposits less surrenders, death benefits, policy charges and annuitizations of investment type contracts, such as variable annuity contracts. In the mutual fund business, net flows are known as net sales. Net sales are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund customers. The Company uses the average daily value of the S&P 500 Index as an indicator for evaluating market returns of the underlying account portfolios in the United States. Relative financial results of variable products are highly correlated to the growth in account values or assets under management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis. Equity market movements could also result in benefits for or charges against deferred acquisition costs. The profitability of fixed annuities and other spread-based products depends largely on the Company ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on its general account assets and interest credited to policyholders. In addition, the size and persistency of gross profits from these businesses is an important driver of earnings as it affects the rate of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. The investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the Company earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits, loss and loss adjustment expenses are paid. Due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations, the majority of the Company invested assets have been held in available-for-sale securities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. The primary investment objective for the Company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations. For a discussion on how The Hartford establishes property and casualty insurance product reserves, see Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of MD&A and for further information on DAC Unlocks, see Estimated Gross Profits Used in the Valuation and Amortization of Assets and Liabilities Associated with Variable Annuity and Other Universal Life-Type Contracts also in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of MD&A. 61 Table of Contents Definitions of Non-GAAP and other measures and ratios Account Value Account value includes policyholders balances for investment contracts and reserves for future policy benefits for insurance contracts. Account value is a measure used by the Company because a significant portion of the Company fee income is based upon the level of account value. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in the amount of account value whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows. After-tax Margin After-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, certain of the segment operating performance. After-tax margin is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Hartford believes that the measure after-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of certain of the Company on-going businesses because it reveals trends in those businesses that may be obscured by the effect of realized gains (losses) or quarterly DAC Unlocks. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to insurance aspects of our businesses. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures exclude the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so after-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, should include net realized gains and losses on net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the statement of operations such as net investment income. DAC Unlocks occur when the Company determines based on actual experience or other evidence, that estimates of future gross profits should be revised. As the DAC Unlock is a reflection of the Company new best estimates of future gross profits, the result and its impact on the DAC amortization ratio is meaningful; however, it does distort the trend of after-tax margin. After-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, should not be considered as a substitute for after-tax margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of our businesses. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both after-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, and after-tax margin when reviewing the Company performance. After Tax Margin is calculated by dividing the earnings measures described above by Total Revenues adjusted for the measures described above. For additional information regarding the DAC Unlock, see Critical Accounting Estimates within the MD&A. Assets Under Administration Assets under administration ( AUA ) represents the client asset base of the Company recordkeeping business for which revenues are predominately based on the number of plan participants. Unlike assets under management, increases or decreases in AUA do not have a direct corresponding increase or decrease to the Company revenues, and therefore are not included in assets under management. Assets Under Management Assets under management ( AUM ) include account values and mutual fund assets. AUM is a measure used by the Company because a significant portion of the Company revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in the amount of account value whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows. Catastrophe ratio The catastrophe ratio (a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current calendar year (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums and includes catastrophe losses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. A catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers. The catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums. Combined ratio The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100.0 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100.0 demonstrates underwriting losses. Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development represents the combined ratio for the current accident year, excluding the impact of catastrophes. The Company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development. Current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes The current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a measure of the cost of non-catastrophe claims incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. Management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development. 62 Table of Contents DAC amortization ratio DAC amortization ratio, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, certain of the segment operating performance. DAC amortization ratio is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Hartford believes that the measure DAC amortization ratio, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of certain of the Company on-going businesses because it reveals trends in our businesses that may be obscured by the effect of realized gains (losses) or quarterly DAC Unlocks. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to insurance aspects of our businesses. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures exclude the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits (DAC amortization ratio), which is typically expressed as a percentage of pre-tax income before the cost of this amortization (an approximation of actual gross profits) and excludes the effects of realized capital gains and losses and DAC Unlock, however should include net realized gains and losses on net periodic settlements on the Japan fixed annuity cross-currency swap. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the statement of operations such as net investment income. DAC Unlocks occur when the Company determines based on actual experience or other evidence, that estimates of future gross profits should be revised. As the DAC Unlock is a reflection of the Company new best estimates of future gross profits, the result and its impact on the DAC amortization ratio is meaningful; however, it does distort the trend of DAC amortization ratio. DAC amortization ratio, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, should not be considered as a substitute for DAC amortization ratio and does not reflect the overall profitability of our businesses. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both DAC amortization ratio, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, and DAC amortization ratio when reviewing the Company performance. For additional information regarding the DAC Unlock, see Critical Accounting Estimates within the MD&A. Expense ratio The expense ratio for the underwriting segments of Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets is the ratio of underwriting expenses, excluding bad debt expense, to earned premiums. Underwriting expenses include the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance operating costs and expenses. Deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term. The expense ratio for the remaining segments is expressed as a ratio of insurance operating costs and expenses to a revenue measure, depending on the type of business. This calculation excludes the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, which is calculated as a separate ratio, and is discussed below. Fee Income Fee income is largely driven from amounts collected as a result of contractually defined percentages of assets under management. These fees are generally collected on a daily basis. For individual life insurance products, fees are contractually defined as percentages based on levels of insurance, age, premiums and deposits collected and contract holder value. Life insurance fees are generally collected on a monthly basis. Therefore, the growth in assets under management either through positive net flows or net sales, or favorable equity market performance will have a favorable impact on fee income. Conversely, either negative net flows or net sales, or unfavorable equity market performance will reduce fee income. Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is a measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses incurred for both the current and prior accident years, as well as the costs of mortality and morbidity and other contractholder benefits to policyholders. Since Group Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the underwriting results of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the Company to achieve its targeted return on equity fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the ratemaking process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage. Loss ratio, excluding buyouts The loss ratio is utilized for the Group Benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. Buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts. 63 Table of Contents Mutual Fund Assets Mutual fund assets include retail, investment-only and college savings plan assets under Section 529 of the Code, collectively referred to as non-proprietary, and proprietary mutual funds. Non-proprietary mutual fund assets are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the Company. Proprietary mutual funds include mutual funds sponsored by the Company which are owned by the separate accounts of the Company to support insurance and investment products sold by the Company. The non-proprietary mutual fund assets are not reflected in the Company consolidated financial statements. Mutual fund assets are a measure used by the Company because a significant portion of the Company revenues are based upon asset values. These revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in the amount of account value whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows. Net Investment Spread Management evaluates performance of certain products based on net investment spread. These products include those that have insignificant mortality risk, such as fixed annuities, certain general account universal life contracts and certain institutional contracts. Net investment spread is determined by taking the difference between the earned rate, (excluding the effects of realized capital gains and losses, including those related to the Company GMWB product and related reinsurance and hedging programs), and the related crediting rates on average general account assets under management. The net investment spreads are for the total portfolio of relevant contracts in each segment and reflect business written at different times. When pricing products, the Company considers current investment yields and not the portfolio average. The determination of credited rates is based upon consideration of current market rates for similar products, portfolio yields and contractually guaranteed minimum credited rates. Net investment spread can be volatile period over period, which can have a significant positive or negative effect on the operating results of each segment. The volatile nature of net investment spread is driven primarily by earnings on limited partnership and other alternative investments and prepayment premiums on securities. Investment earnings can also be influenced by factors such as changes in interest rates, credit spreads and decisions to hold higher levels of short-term investments. Net investment spread is calculated by dividing net investment earnings by average reserves using a 13-point average, less interest credited divided by average account value using a 13-point average. New business written premium New business written premium represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issues to customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. New business written premium plus renewal policy written premium equals total written premium. Policies in force Policies in force represent the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. The number of policies in force is a growth measure used for Consumer Markets and standard commercial lines within Property & Casualty Commercial and is affected by both new business growth and premium renewal retention. Policy count retention Policy count retention represents the ratio of the number of policies renewed during the period divided by the number of policies from the previous policy term period. The number of policies available to renew from the previous policy term represents the number of policies written in the previous policy term net of any cancellations of those policies. Policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. Policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by competitors. Policyholder dividend ratio The policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium. Prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio The prior year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums. Reinstatement premiums Reinstatement premium represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment. Renewal earned pricing increase (decrease) Written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain personal lines auto business and 12 months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company business. Because the Company earns premiums over the 6 to 12 month term of the policies, renewal earned pricing increases (decreases) lag renewal written pricing increases (decreases) by 6 to 12 months. 64 Table of Contents Renewal written pricing increase (decrease) Renewal written pricing increase (decrease) represents the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure since the prior year. The rate component represents the average change in rate filings during the period and the amount of insurance represents the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for auto, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers compensation. The renewal written price increase (decrease) does not include other factors that affect average premium per unit of exposure such as changes in the mix of business by state, territory, class plan and tier of risk. A number of factors affect renewal written pricing increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the Company pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company underwriters and marketplace competition. Renewal written pricing changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. Return on Assets ( ROA ) ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, certain of the segment operating performance. ROA is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The Hartford believes that the measure ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of certain of the Company on-going businesses because it reveals trends in our businesses that may be obscured by the effect of realized gains (losses) or quarterly DAC Unlocks. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to insurance aspects of our businesses. Accordingly, this non-GAAP measures exclude the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so ROA, excluding the realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, should include net realized gains and losses on net periodic settlements on the Japan fixed annuity cross-currency swap. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the statement of operations, such as net investment income. DAC Unlocks occur when the Company determines based on actual experience or other evidence, that estimates of future gross profits should be revised. As the DAC Unlock is a reflection of the Company new best estimates of future gross profits, the result and its impact on the DAC amortization ratio is meaningful; however, it does distort the trend of ROA. ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, should not be considered as a substitute for ROA and does not reflect the overall profitability of our businesses. Therefore, the Company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, and ROA when reviewing the Company performance. ROA is calculated by dividing the earnings measures described above by a two-point average AUM. Underwriting results Underwriting results is a before-tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends. The Hartford believes that underwriting results provides investors with a valuable measure of before-tax profitability derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the Company investing activities. The underwriting segments of Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets are evaluated by management primarily based upon underwriting results. A reconciliation of underwriting results to net income for Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets is set forth in their respective discussions herein. Written and earned premiums Written premium is a statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. Earned premium is a U.S. GAAP and statutory measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Management believes that written premium is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company sale of property and casualty insurance products. Written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded reinsurance premium. Traditional life insurance type products, such as those sold by Group Benefits, collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. These premiums together with net investment income earned from the overall investment strategy are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts. Two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. Sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, customer demand for the Company product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the Company reputation and ratings. Persistency refers to the percentage of policies remaining in-force from year-to-year. 65 Table of Contents KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND RATIOS The Hartford considers several measures and ratios to be the key performance indicators for its businesses. The following discussions include the more significant ratios and measures of profitability for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the underlying trends in The Hartford businesses. However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the results presented in the segment discussions that follow in this MD&A. These ratios and measures may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company competitors. Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development is a key indicator of overall profitability for the property and casualty underwriting segments of Property & Casualty Commercial and Consumer Markets since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development. Property & Casualty Commercial 2010 2009 2008 Combined ratio 89.7 85.9 89.4 Catastrophe ratio 2.7 0.9 4.0 Non-catastrophe prior year development (6.3 ) (6.3 ) (4.2 ) Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development 93.4 91.2 89.6 Consumer Markets Combined ratio 99.0 97.2 92.9 Catastrophe ratio 7.8 5.9 6.7 Non-catastrophe prior year development (2.4 ) (1.0 ) (1.5 ) Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development 93.6 92.3 87.7 Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 Property & Casualty Commercial combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development increased primarily due to higher severity on package business and workers compensation, as well as an increased ratio for specialty casualty, and to a lesser extent an increase in the expense ratio due to increased expenses for taxes, licenses and fees. Consumer Markets combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development increased primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes for auto of 1.3 points due to higher auto physical damage emerged frequency and higher expected auto liability loss costs relative to average premium. The current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes for home increased 0.7 points primarily due to an increase in loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by the effect of earned pricing increases. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Property & Casualty Commercial combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development for the year increased, primarily due a decrease in earned premium and an increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes. The increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes was primarily due to a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio on workers compensation, package business and general liability, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe losses on property and marine business driven by favorable claim frequency and severity. Consumer Markets combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development for the year increased, primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes for both auto and home. The increase for auto was due to an increase in expected liability loss costs, an increase in physical damage frequency and a decline in average premium. The increase for home was driven by increasing severity and frequency, offset by a decline in average premium. 66 Table of Contents Return on Assets Return on assets is a key indicator of overall profitability for the Global Annuity, Retirement Plans and Mutual Funds reporting segments as a significant portion of their earnings is based on average assets under management. Ratios 2010 2009 2008 Global Annuity [1] ROA 26.1 bps (75.0 ) bps (132.9 ) bps Effect of net realized losses, net of tax and DAC on ROA (19.0 ) bps (53.3 ) bps (106.3 ) bps Effect of DAC Unlock on ROA 4.9 bps (47.0 ) bps (49.1 ) bps ROA, excluding realized losses and DAC Unlock 40.2 bps 25.3 bps 22.5 bps Retirement Plans [1] ROA 9.7 bps (54.8 ) bps (47.9 ) bps Effect of net realized losses, net of tax and DAC on ROA (4.8 ) bps (46.4 ) bps (51.3 ) bps Effect of DAC Unlock on ROA 5.4 bps (11.4 ) bps (14.6 ) bps ROA, excluding realized losses and DAC Unlock 9.1 bps 3.0 bps 18.0 bps Mutual Funds [1] ROA 13.6 bps 8.8 bps 8.8 bps Effect of net realized gains (losses), net of tax and DAC on ROA 4.3 bps bps (0.2 ) bps Effect of DAC Unlock on ROA bps bps (0.3 ) bps ROA, excluding realized gains and DAC Unlock 9.3 bps 8.8 bps 9.3 bps [1] Proprietary mutual funds, Investment-Only mutual funds, Canadian mutual funds, and 529 college savings plans effective January 1, 2010, are reported in the mutual fund business mix in 2010. Prior to 2010, proprietary mutual fund assets were included in Global Annuity, Retirement Plans, and Mutual Funds, as those same assets generate earnings for each of these segments. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Global Annuity ROA, excluding realized losses and DAC Unlock, increased primarily due to improved net investment income on limited partnerships and other alternative investments, a lower DAC amortization rate, improved operating expenses associated with the restructuring of the international annuity operations and the absence of 3 Win charges recognized in the first quarter of 2009 of $40, after-tax. Retirement Plans ROA, excluding realized losses and DAC Unlock, increased primarily due to improved performance on limited partnerships and other alternative investments in 2010, and was driven by improvement in the equity markets, which led to increased account values and increased deposit activity. Mutual Funds ROA, excluding realized gains, increase was primarily driven by improvement in the equity markets, which enabled this business to partially return to scale, and the impact of lower operating expenses, partially offset by the addition of proprietary mutual fund assets to this line of business, which has a lower ROA level than the non-proprietary business. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to year ended December 31, 2008 Global Annuity ROA, excluding realized losses and DAC Unlock, increased primarily due to the impact of the write off of goodwill in 2008 of $274, after-tax, partially offset by higher DAC amortization and lower investment spread in 2009. In addition, Global Annuity ROA, excluding realized losses and DAC Unlock, for the year ended December 31, 2009 improved due to lower 3 Win related charges in 2009 versus 2008 of $40 and $152, after-tax, respectively. Retirement Plans ROA, excluding realized losses and DAC Unlock, decreased primarily due to lower returns on fixed maturities and a full year of activity from the business acquired in 2008, which had produced a lower ROA.

Group Benefits after-tax margin (excluding buyouts), excluding realized gains (losses), decrease was primarily due to a higher loss ratio from unfavorable morbidity driven by lower claim terminations on disability business. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to year ended December 31, 2008 Life Insurance after-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, decrease was primarily due to a higher DAC amortization, partially offset by a lower effective rate and lower operating expenses. Group Benefits after-tax margin (excluding buyouts), excluding realized gains (losses), decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable loss ratio that resulted from unfavorable morbidity experience, which was primarily due to unfavorable reserve development from the 2008 incurral loss year and higher new incurred long-term disability claims in 2009. 68 Table of Contents Investment Results Composition of Invested Assets December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Amount Percent Amount Percent Fixed maturities, AFS, at fair value $ 77,820 79.2 % $ 71,153 76.3 % Fixed maturities, at fair value using the fair value option 649 0.7 % Equity securities, AFS, at fair value 973 1.0 % 1,221 1.3 % Mortgage loans 4,489 4.6 % 5,938 6.4 % Policy loans, at outstanding balance 2,181 2.2 % 2,174 2.3 % Limited partnerships and other alternative investments 1,918 2.0 % 1,790 1.9 % Other investments [1] 1,617 1.6 % 602 0.7 % Short-term investments 8,528 8.7 % 10,357 11.1 % Total investments excluding equity securities, trading 98,175 100.0 % 93,235 100.0 % Equity securities, trading, at fair value [2] 32,820 32,321 Total investments $ 130,995 $ 125,556 [1] Primarily relates to derivative instruments. [2] These assets primarily support the Global Annuity-International variable annuity business. Changes in these balances are also reflected in the respective liabilities. Total investments increased since December 31, 2009 primarily due to increases in fixed maturities, AFS, and other investments, partially offset by declines in short-term investments and mortgage loans. The increase in fixed maturities, AFS, was largely the result of improved security valuations as a result of a decline in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, credit spread tightening, as well as the reallocation of short-term investment and mortgage loan proceeds. The increase in other investments primarily related to increases in value related to derivatives. The decline in mortgage loans was primarily related to sales of B-Note and mezzanine exposures.

Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 Total net investment income decreased largely due to equity securities, trading, resulting primarily from declines in market performance of the underlying investment funds supporting the Japanese variable annuity product. Total net investment income, excluding equity securities, trading, increased primarily due to improved performance of limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily within real estate and private equity funds, partially offset by lower income on fixed maturities resulting from a decline in average short-term interest rates and lower reinvestment rates. The Company expectation, based on the current interest rate and credit environment, is that upcoming maturities will be reinvested at a similar rate. Therefore, the Company expects the 2011 portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership investments, to be relatively consistent with the 2010 portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Total net investment income increased primarily due to equity securities, trading, resulting from improved market performance of the underlying investment funds supporting the Japanese variable annuity product. Total net investment income, excluding equity securities, trading, decreased primarily due to lower income on fixed maturities resulting from a decline in average rates and fixed maturity investments, as well as an increased average asset base of securities with greater market liquidity. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in other income from interest rate swaps hedging variable rate bonds due to a decrease in LIBOR. Also offsetting were decreased losses on limited partnerships and other alternative investments, primarily within hedge funds. 69 Table of Contents Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Gross gains on sales $ 836 $ 1,056 $ 607 Gross losses on sales (522 ) (1,397 ) (856 ) Net OTTI losses recognized in earnings (434 ) (1,508 ) (3,964 ) Valuation allowances on mortgage loans (157 ) (403 ) (26 ) Japanese fixed annuity contract hedges, net [1] 27 47 64 Periodic net coupon settlements on credit derivatives/Japan (17 ) (49 ) (33 ) Fair value measurement transition impact (650 ) Results of variable annuity hedge program GMWB derivatives, net 111 1,526 (713 ) Macro hedge program (562 ) (895 ) 74 Total results of variable annuity hedge program (451 ) 631 (639 ) Other, net [2] 164 (387 ) (421 ) Net realized capital losses, before-tax $ (554 ) $ (2,010 ) $ (5,918 ) [1] Relates to derivative hedging instruments, excluding periodic net coupon settlements, and is net of the Japanese fixed annuity product liability adjustment for changes in the dollar/yen exchange spot rate.

Details on the Company net realized capital gains and losses are as follows: Gross gains and losses on sales Gross gains and losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were predominantly from sales of investment grade corporate securities in order to take advantage of attractive market opportunities, as well as, sales of U.S. Treasuries related to tactical repositioning of the portfolio. Gross gains and losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were predominantly within corporate, government and structured securities. Also included were gains of $360 related to the sale of Verisk/ISO securities. Gross gains and losses on sales primarily resulted from efforts to reduce portfolio risk through sales of subordinated financials and real estate related securities and from sales of U.S. Treasuries to manage liquidity. Gross gains and losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily resulted from the decision to reallocate the portfolio to securities with more favorable risk/return profiles. Also included was a gain of $141 from the sale of a synthetic CDO. Net OTTI losses For further information, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Credit Risk section of the MD&A.

The net loss on the macro hedge program was primarily the result of a higher equity market valuation and the impact of trading activity. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the gain on GMWB derivatives, net, was primarily due to liability model assumption updates related to favorable policyholder experience of $566, the relative outperformance of the underlying actively managed funds as compared to their respective indices of $550, and the impact of the Company own credit standing of $154. Additional net gains of $56 resulted from lower implied market volatility and a general increase in long-term interest rates, partially offset by rising equity markets. Increasing equity markets resulted in a loss of $895 related to the Company macro hedge program. Total gains related to GMWB hedging in 2009 were $1.5 billion. For further information, see Note 4a of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see the Company variable annuity hedging program sensitivity disclosures within Capital Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the loss on GMWB derivatives, net, was primarily due to losses of $904 related to market-base hedge ineffectiveness due to extremely volatile capital markets and $355 related to the relative outperformance of the underlying actively managed funds as compared to their respective indices, partially offset by gains of $470 in the fourth quarter related to liability model assumption updates for lapse rates. Other, net Other, net gains for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to gains of $217 on credit derivatives driven by credit spreads tightening, gains of $102 related to Japan variable annuity hedges due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen, gains of $62 related to the sale of Hartford Investments Canada Corporation mutual fund business and gains of $59 on interest rate derivatives used to manage portfolio duration driven by a decline in long-term interest rates, partially offset by losses of $(326) on transactional foreign currency re-valuation due to an increase in value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar associated with the internal reinsurance of the Japan variable annuity business, which is offset in AOCI. Other, net losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily resulted in net losses of $463 on credit derivatives where the Company purchased credit protection due to credit spread tightening and approximately $300 from contingent obligations associated with the Allianz transaction. These losses were partially offset by gains of $155 on credit derivatives that assume credit risk due to credit spread tightening, as well as $140 from a change in spot rates related to transactional foreign currency predominately on the internal reinsurance of the Japan variable annuity business, which is offset in AOCI. Other, net losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were primarily due to net losses of $291 related to transactional foreign currency losses predominately on the internal reinsurance of the Japan variable annuity business, which is offset in AOCI, resulting from appreciation of the yen, as well as credit derivative losses of $312 due to significant credit spread widening. Also included were derivative related losses of $46 due to counterparty default related to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 71 Table of Contents PROPERTY & CASUALTY COMMERCIAL Underwriting Summary 2010 2009 2008 Written premiums $ 5,796 $ 5,715 $ 6,291 Change in unearned premium reserve 52 (188 ) (104 ) Earned premiums 5,744 5,903 6,395 Losses and loss adjustment expenses Current accident year before catastrophes 3,579 3,582 3,835 Current accident year catastrophes 152 78 285 Prior accident years (361 ) (394 ) (298 ) Total losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,370 3,266 3,822 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 1,353 1,393 1,461 Insurance operating costs and expenses 431 409 434 Underwriting results 590 835 678 Net servicing income 9 13 Net investment income 939 759 803 Net realized capital gains (losses) 5 (213 ) (1,277 ) Other expenses (127 ) (132 ) (119 ) Income before income taxes 1,407 1,258 98 Income tax expense (benefit) 412 359 (35 ) Net income $ 995 $ 899 $ 133 Premium Measures 2010 2009 2008 New business premium $ 1,122 $ 1,101 $ 1,089 Standard commercial lines policy count retention 84 % 81 % 82 % Standard commercial lines renewal written pricing increase (decrease) 1 % (1 %) (4 %) Standard commercial lines renewal earned pricing increase (decrease) (2 %) (3 %) Standard commercial lines policies in-force as of end of period 1,211,047 1,159,759 1,138,483 Ratios 2010 2009 2008 Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio Current accident year before catastrophes 62.3 60.7 60.0 Current accident year catastrophes 2.7 1.3 4.5 Prior accident years (6.3 ) (6.7 ) (4.7 ) Total loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 58.7 55.3 59.8 Expense ratio 31.0 30.4 28.9 Policyholder dividend ratio 0.1 0.2 0.7 Combined ratio 89.7 85.9 89.4 Catastrophe ratio Current accident year 2.7 1.3 4.5 Prior accident years (0.4 ) (0.4 ) Total catastrophe ratio 2.7 0.9 4.0 Combined ratio before catastrophes 87.1 84.9 85.4 Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development 93.4 91.2 89.6 Other revenues [1] $ 308 $ 334 $ 363 [1] Represents servicing revenues. 72 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 Net income increased in 2010, as compared to the prior year, driven by improvements in net realized capital gains (losses) and higher net investment income, despite a decrease in underwriting results. The primary causes of the decrease in underwriting results were lower earned premiums and higher current accident year catastrophe losses. Earned premiums decreased across most product lines, with the exception of workers compensation and specialty casualty. The effects of the economic downturn have contributed to the decrease in earned premiums during 2010. Although earned premiums declined, several key measures have shown improvement. New business written premium increased, driven by increases in specialty casualty and package business, partially offset by decreases in general liability, professional liability and marine. In addition, for standard commercial lines, policy count retention has increased in all lines of business, due in part by an improvement in mid-term cancellations in 2010. Renewal earned pricing was flat for standard commercial lines, as an increase in package business and property was offset by a decrease in all other lines. The earned pricing changes were primarily a reflection of written pricing changes over the last year. Renewal written pricing increased for standard commercial lines driven by increases in property and workers compensation, partially offset by decreases in all other lines. Lastly, the number of policies-in-force increased, primarily due to the increase in policy count retention. The growth in policies in-force does not correspond directly with the change in earned premiums due to the effect of changes in earned pricing and changes in the average premium per policy. Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased slightly, due to the decrease in earned premiums, which was mostly offset by an increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes. The ratio increased, primarily due to higher severity on package business and workers compensation, as well as an increased ratio for specialty casualty. Current accident year catastrophe losses in 2010 were higher than in 2009 primarily due to more severe windstorm events, particularly from hail in the West, Midwest, plains states and the Southeast, and from winter storms in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Losses in 2009 were primarily incurred from ice storms, windstorms and tornadoes across many states. Net favorable prior accident year reserve development, in both periods, included reserve releases in the following: general liability, professional liability, workers compensation, auto liability and uncollectible reinsurance. Reserve development in 2010 also included a release in package business, while reserve development in 2009 also included strengthening in both package business and fidelity and surety. For a discussion on prior accident year reserve development, see the Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance section within Critical Accounting Estimates. Insurance operating costs and expenses increased in 2010, driven by an increase in taxes, licenses and fees of $19, which included a $5 increase in reserve strengthening for other state funds and taxes and a $7 reduction in TWIA assessments recognized in 2009 related to hurricane Ike. Also contributing to the increase were higher IT costs. The increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $5 in dividends payable primarily for workers compensation policyholders, and lower compensation-related costs. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased, largely due to the decrease in earned premiums. Net realized capital gains (losses) improved as compared to the prior year, as did net investment income. The improvements in net realized capital gains (loss) were primarily driven by lower impairments in 2010 compared to 2009 and realized gains on derivatives in 2010 compared to losses in 2009. Net investment income increased in 2010, primarily as a result of improvements in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, partially offset by lower returns on taxable fixed maturities due to declining interest rates. For additional information, see the Investment Results section within Key Performance Measures and Ratios. The effective tax rate, in both periods, differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences related to investments in tax exempt securities. For further discussion, see Income Taxes within Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 73 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Net income increased significantly in 2009, compared to 2008, driven by an increase in underwriting results coupled with improvements in net realized capital losses. Underwriting results increased primarily due to lower losses and loss adjustment expenses for the current accident year before catastrophes, lower current accident year catastrophe losses, and more favorable prior accident year development, partially offset by decreases in earned premiums. Earned premiums decreased in 2009, in nearly all lines of businesses. The decrease was primarily due to lower earned audit premium on workers compensation business and the effect of non-renewals outpacing new business over the last two years for package business and commercial auto. Property earned premiums decreased, primarily due to the sale of the Company core excess and surplus lines property business. For additional information on this sale, see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. New business written premium increased, primarily driven by the increase in workers compensation and package business, partially offset by a decrease in new business for professional liability, marine, general liability and commercial auto. Despite continued pricing competition, the Company has increased new business for workers compensation by targeting business in selected industries and regions of the country where attractive new business opportunities remain. For standard commercial lines, earned pricing decreased, primarily driven by decreases in workers compensation, commercial auto, general liability, property and marine, partially offset by an increase in package business. The earned pricing changes were primarily a reflection of written pricing changes over the last two years. A number of carriers have continued to compete aggressively on price, particularly on larger accounts. In addition to the effect of written pricing decreases in workers compensation, average premium per policy has declined due to a reduction in the payrolls of workers compensation insureds and the effect of declining endorsements. Also, for standard commercial lines, policy count retention decreased slightly as the effects of the downturn in the economy caused business closures and increased shopping of policies by businesses seeking lower premiums. The number of policies in-force increased in 2009, as the growth in policies in-force does not correspond directly with the change in earned premiums due to the effect of changes in earned pricing and changes in the average premium per policy. Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased, primarily due to a decrease in earned premium, partially offset by a slight increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes. The increase in the ratio was primarily due to a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio on workers compensation, package business and general liability, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe losses on property and marine business, driven by favorable claim frequency and severity. The higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio on workers compensation and general liability business was primarily due to the effects of renewal earned pricing decreases in excess of loss cost change. Current accident year catastrophe losses decreased as losses in 2008 from hurricane Ike and tornadoes and thunderstorms in the South and Midwest were higher than losses in 2009. Losses in 2009 were primarily incurred from ice storms, windstorms, and tornadoes across Colorado, the Midwest and Southeast. Net favorable prior accident year reserve development, in both periods, included reserve releases in the following: workers compensation, general liability, including umbrella and high hazard liability, professional liability and auto liability. Reserve development in 2009 also included strengthening in both package business and fidelity and surety, and releases in uncollectible reinsurance and catastrophes, while reserve development in 2008 also included strengthening in general liability, including product liability and national accounts. For a discussion on prior accident year reserve development, see the Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance section within Critical Accounting Estimates. Insurance operating costs and expenses decreased primarily due to a $37 decrease in the estimated amount of dividends payable to certain workers compensation policyholders and a decrease in TWIA assessments of $17, partially offset by increase in taxes, license and fees of $23 and higher compensation-related costs. The increase in taxes, license and fees included, a $6 increase in the assessment for a second injury fund and $9 reserve strengthening for other state funds and taxes. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased largely due to the decrease in earned premiums. Net realized capital gains (losses) improved significantly in 2009. The improvements were driven primarily by lower impairments in 2009 compared to 2008. Net investment income decreased in 2009, primarily due to lower income on fixed maturities resulting from a decline in average rates, partially offset by decreased losses on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For additional information, see the Investment Results section within Key Performance Measures and Ratios. The effective tax rate, in both periods, differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate. In 2009, this is primarily due to permanent differences related to investments in tax exempt securities. In 2008, there was a net income tax benefit despite having pre-tax income due to an income tax benefit on realized capital losses that was greater than the income tax expense on all other components of pre-tax income. For further discussion, see Income Taxes within Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 74 Table of Contents GROUP BENEFITS Operating Summary 2010 2009 2008 Premiums and other considerations $ 4,278 $ 4,350 $ 4,391 Net investment income 429 403 419 Net realized capital gains (losses) 46 (124 ) (540 ) Total revenues 4,753 4,629 4,270 Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,331 3,196 3,144 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 61 61 57 Insurance operating costs and other expenses 1,111 1,120 1,128 Total benefits, losses and expenses 4,503 4,377 4,329 Income (loss) before income taxes 250 252 (59 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 65 59 (53 ) Net income (loss) $ 185 $ 193 $ (6 ) Premiums and other considerations 2010 2009 2008 Fully insured ongoing premiums $ 4,166 $ 4,309 $ 4,355 Buyout premiums 58 1 Other 54 41 35 Total premiums and other considerations $ 4,278 $ 4,350 $ 4,391 Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts $ 583 $ 741 $ 820 Ratios, excluding buyouts Loss ratio 77.6 % 73.5 % 71.6 % Loss ratio, excluding financial institutions 82.8 % 77.8 % 76.3 % Expense ratio 27.8 % 27.1 % 27.0 % Expense ratio, excluding financial institutions 23.3 % 22.6 % 22.4 % Group Benefits has a block of financial institution business that is experience rated. This business comprised approximately 9% to 10% of the segment 2010, 2009 and 2008 premiums and other considerations (excluding buyouts). With respect to the segment net income (loss), excluding net realized capital gains (losses), the financial institution business comprised 6% for 2010, and on average, 2% to 4% for 2009 and 2008, excluding the commission accrual adjustment in 2009 discussed below. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 Net income decreased as compared to prior year, as a decrease in premiums and other considerations and higher claim costs offset the improvements in net realized capital gains (losses) and net investment income. Premiums and other considerations decreased due to a 3% decline in fully insured ongoing premiums which was driven by lower sales due to the competitive marketplace, and the pace of the economic recovery. The loss ratio, excluding buyouts, increased compared to the prior year, particularly in group disability, primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience from higher incidence and lower claim terminations. The favorable change to net realized capital gains in 2010, from net realized capital losses in 2009, was due to impairments on investment securities recorded in 2009. For further discussion on impairments, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Credit Risk section of the MD&A. Net investment income increased as a result of higher weighted average portfolio yields primarily due to improved performance on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. The effective tax rate, in both periods, differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences related to investments in tax exempt securities. For further discussion, see Income Taxes within Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The change to net income in 2009, from a net loss in 2008, was primarily due to lower net realized capital losses in 2009, partially offset by higher claim costs, and decreases in premiums and other considerations and net investment income. The lower net realized capital losses were primarily driven by fewer impairments in 2009 compared to 2008. For further discussion on impairments, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Credit Risk section of the MD&A. The segment loss ratio increased primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, which was primarily due to unfavorable reserve development from the 2008 incurral loss year and higher new incurred long term disability claims in 2009. In addition, premiums and other considerations decreased primarily due to reductions in covered lives within our customer base, and to a lesser extent, lower sales. Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts, were lower as compared to the prior year due to the competitive marketplace and the economic environment. Net investment income decreased primarily as a result of lower yields on fixed maturity investments. The effective tax rate, in both periods, differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences related to investments in tax exempt securities.

The primary causes of the decrease in underwriting results were higher current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses, including catastrophes, partially offset by more favorable prior accident year reserve development. The lower underwriting results were offset by improvements in net realized capital gains (losses) and higher net investment income. Earned premiums decreased in 2010, as lower earned premiums in auto were partially offset by an increase in homeowners . Auto earned premiums were down reflecting a decrease in new business written premium and policy count retention since the fourth quarter of 2009 and a decrease in average renewal earned premium per policy. Homeowners earned premiums grew primarily due to the effect of increases in earned pricing, partially offset by a decrease in new business written premium and policy count retention. Auto and home new business written premium decreased primarily due to the effect of written pricing increases and underwriting actions that lowered the policy issue rate. Also contributing to the decrease in new business were fewer responses from direct marketing on AARP business and fewer quotes from independent agents driven by increased competition. Partially offsetting the decrease in auto new business was the effect of an increase in policies sold to AARP members through agents. Partially offsetting the decrease in home new business was an increase in the cross-sale of homeowners insurance to insureds that have auto policies. The change in auto renewal earned pricing was due to rate increases and the effect of policyholders purchasing newer vehicle models in place of older models. Despite auto renewal earned pricing increasing, average renewal earned premium per policy for auto declined due to a shift to more preferred market segments and a greater concentration of business in states and territories with lower average premium. Homeowners renewal earned pricing increased due to rate increases and increased coverage amounts reflecting higher rebuilding costs. For both auto and home, the Company has increased rates in certain states for certain classes of business to maintain profitability in the face of rising loss costs. Policy count retention for auto and home decreased primarily driven by the effect of renewal written pricing increases and underwriting actions to improve profitability. The decrease in the policy count retention for homeowners was partially offset by the effect of the Company non-renewal of Florida homeowners agency business in 2009. Compared to 2009, the number of policies in-force as of 2010 decreased for both auto and home, driven by the decreases in policy retention and new business. Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes increased primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes for auto of 1.3 points due to higher auto physical damage emerged frequency and higher expected auto liability loss costs relative to average premium. The current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes for home increased 0.7 points primarily due to an increase in loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by the effect of earned pricing increases. Current accident year catastrophes were higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to a severe wind and hail storm event in Arizona during the fourth quarter of 2010. Losses in 2010 were also incurred from tornadoes, thunderstorms and hail events in the Midwest, plains states and the Southeast, as well as from winter storms in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Catastrophe losses in 2009 were primarily incurred from windstorms in Texas and the Midwest as well as the two large Colorado hail and windstorm events. Net favorable reserve development was higher in 2010 due to more favorable development of auto liability reserves. Net favorable reserve development in both 2010 and 2009 included a release of personal auto liability reserves, partially offset by a strengthening of reserves for non-catastrophe homeowners claims. For additional information on prior accident year reserve development, see the Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance section within Critical Accounting Estimates. 77 Table of Contents The expense ratio increased due largely to an $8 increase in legal settlement costs in 2010 and higher amortization of acquisition costs on AARP business, partially offset by lower direct marketing spend for consumer direct business. Also contributing to the increase in the expense ratio was a $7 reduction of TWIA hurricane assessments in 2009 largely offset by an $8 increase in reserves for other state funds and taxes in 2009. Net realized capital gains (losses) improved, as compared to prior year. The improvements were primarily driven by lower impairments in 2010 compared to 2009, and realized gains on derivatives in 2010 compared to losses in 2009. Net investment income increased, primarily as a result of increased income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, partially offset by lower returns on taxable fixed maturities due to declining interest rates. For additional information, see the Investment Results section within Key Performance Measures and Ratios. The effective tax rate, in both periods, differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to permanent differences related to investments in tax exempt securities. For further discussion, see Income Taxes within Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Net income increased as a result of lower net realized capital losses, partially offset by a decrease in underwriting results and lower net investment income. Earned premiums grew in 2009, as a result of an increase in auto, while homeowners remained flat. The increase in auto earned premiums was primarily due to the effect of an increase in new business, largely offset by a decrease in average renewal premium per policy. Homeowners earned premiums were flat as the effect of an increase in new business was largely offset by a decrease in policy count retention. Auto and homeowners new business written premium increased in 2009 primarily due to increased direct marketing spend, increased agency appointments, higher auto policy conversion rates and cross-selling homeowners insurance to insureds that have auto policies. This increase in new business helped drive an increase in the number of policies in-force in both auto and homeowners. Policy count retention for auto remained flat in 2009, primarily due to stable renewal written pricing increases and policy retention initiatives. Policy count retention for homeowners decreased slightly in 2009, primarily due to the Company decision to stop renewing Florida homeowners policies written through independent agents. The increases in renewal earned pricing during 2009 were primarily a reflection of written pricing in the second half of 2008 and first half of 2009. Renewal written pricing in 2009 increased in auto due to rate increases and the effect of policyholders purchasing newer vehicle models in place of older models. Homeowners renewal written pricing increased due to rate increases and increased coverage amounts reflecting higher rebuilding costs. For both auto and home, the Company has increased rates in certain states for certain classes of business to maintain profitability in the face of rising loss costs. While the Company recognized higher renewal earned pricing in 2009, driven by higher rates and an increase in the amount of insurance per exposure unit, average renewal premium per policy decreased for auto and was flat for home. For both auto and home, average renewal premium was impacted by a shift to more preferred market segment business and growth in states and territories with lower average premium. In addition, average renewal premium was affected by the impact of the economic downturn on consumer behavior. Among other actions, in 2009 insureds reduced their premiums by raising deductibles, reducing limits, dropping coverage and reducing mileage. Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes increased, primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes, driven by a 3.3 point increase for auto and a 4.2 point increase for home. The increase for auto was due to an increase in expected liability loss costs, an increase in physical damage frequency and a decline in average premium. After a historically low claim frequency in 2008, auto claim frequency increased in 2009, mostly in bodily injury coverage, driven by an increase in miles driven. The increase for home was driven by increasing frequency and severity coupled with a decline in average premium. Current accident year catastrophes decreased by $30 as catastrophe losses in 2008, driven by losses from hurricane Ike and from wind and thunderstorms, were higher than catastrophe losses in 2009, driven by losses from hail and windstorms in Colorado, the Midwest and the Southeast. Net favorable reserve development was lower in 2009 than in 2008. Net favorable reserve development in 2009 included a release of personal auto liability reserves, partially offset by a strengthening of reserves for homeowners claims. Net favorable reserve development in 2008 included a release of personal auto liability reserves. For additional information on prior accident year reserve development, see the Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance section within Critical Accounting Estimates. The expense ratio increased due largely to higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs and an increase in other non-deferrable costs, partially offset by a decrease in TWIA assessments of $17. Also contributing to the increase in the expense ratio was an $8 increase in reserves for other state funds and taxes in 2009. Amortization of acquisition costs increased due to an increase in direct marketing costs. Net realized capital gains (losses) improved significantly in 2009. The improvements were primarily driven by lower impairments in 2009 compared to 2008. Net investment income decreased in 2009, primarily as a result of lower returns on taxable fixed maturities due to declining interest rates. For additional information, see the Investment Results section within Key Performance Measures and Ratios. The effective tax rate, in both periods, differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate. In 2009, this is primarily due to permanent differences related to investments in tax exempt securities. In 2008, there was an income tax benefit on realized capital losses that partially offset the income tax expense on all other components of pre-tax income.

This account value is not expected to generate material future profit or loss to the Company. [4] Investment-Only mutual fund assets were transferred to Mutual Funds effective January 1, 2010. 79 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 Global Annuity net income in 2010 compared to a net loss in 2009 is primarily due to significant improvements in the equity markets, which resulted in an Unlock benefit in 2010 as compared to an Unlock charge in 2009, as well as continued market value appreciation in account value resulting in increased fee income, and due to continued expense reduction efforts in 2010. Additionally, 2009 includes a charge of $60, pre-tax, related to 3 Wins within benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher net realized capital losses. The Unlock benefit was $65, after-tax, in 2010 as compared to an Unlock charge of $924, after-tax, in 2009. The benefit in 2010 was primarily due to equity market improvements that were greater than expectations for the year ended December 31, 2010, while 2009 charge was primarily the result of equity market performance significantly below expectations for the first quarter of 2009. The Unlock resulted in decreases to both benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses and amortization of DAC. For further discussion of the Unlock see the Critical Accounting Estimates within the MD&A. Insurance operating costs and other expenses have continued to decline as a result of lower operating and wholesaling expenses driven by management active efforts to reduce operating expenses and management efforts to match distribution costs with the Company current lower sales levels. These efforts have also resulted in a decline in the general insurance expense ratio, primarily associated with the U.S. annuity product and the restructuring and active expense management of Japan operations, which have been partially offset by an increase in the average asset base from continued improvements in equity markets. The higher net realized capital losses in 2010 were primarily due to losses on the variable annuity hedging program compared to gains in 2009, partially offset by lower impairment losses in 2010 and net realized gains on sales of securities in 2010 compared to net realized losses in 2009. The variable annuity hedging program losses were $451 in 2010 compared with gains of $631 in 2009. For further discussion on the results of the variable annuity hedging program see Investment Results, Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) within Key Performance Measures and Ratios of the MD&A. Management decision to suspend sales of structured settlements and terminal funding products resulted in decreased earned premiums in 2010 as compared to 2009 with a corresponding decrease in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses. In addition, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses were lower for institutional investment products driven by the Company execution on its call and buyback strategy associated with stable value products, which reduced the related liabilities. Net investment income on securities available-for-sale and other decreased slightly in 2010 as compared to the comparable prior year primarily as a result of significant net outflow activity since 2009 and declines on returns from fixed maturity securities driven by a lower interest rate environment, partially offset by improving investments results on limited partnership and other alternative investments. Net investment spread improved in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to improved performance on limited partnership and other alternative investments of 48 bps, partially offset by a decline in yields on fixed maturity assets of 15 bps, along with lower earnings on other investing activities of 6 bps. The decline in fixed maturity returns was primarily related to a lower interest rate environment. The DAC amortization ratio, excluding net realized capital losses and DAC Unlocks, improved due to rising gross profits driven by equity market appreciation, and improved returns from limited partnerships and other alternative investments. Global Annuity effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to permanent differences for the separate account DRD on U.S. annuity products, as well as varying tax rates by country, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax benefits related to certain realized losses on securities that back certain institutional investment products. Income taxes include separate account DRD benefits of $108 in 2010 compared to $142 in 2009. For further discussion, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 80 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Net loss improved in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses, goodwill impairment in 2008 and lower insurance operating and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in fee income and other, earned premiums and net investment income on securities available-for-sale and other, as well as a higher Unlock charge in 2009. The net realized capital losses declined significantly in 2009 primarily due to gains of $631 on the variable annuity hedging program compared to losses of $639 in 2008, realized losses recorded in 2008 of $650 related to the fair value measurement transition impact, and lower impairment losses in 2009 compared to 2008. For further discussion on these results see Investment Results, Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) within Key Performance Measures and Ratios of the MD&A. Insurance operating costs and other expenses have decreased as compared to 2008 as a result of lower asset based trail commissions due to equity market declines, as well as management active efforts to reduce operating expenses including the restructuring of international operations. These efforts have also resulted in a decline in the general insurance expense ratio. Fee income and other decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decline in average account values of variable annuities driven by significant declines in market value during 2008, continued net outflows in 2009 and the decision in the second quarter of 2009 to suspend new sales in Japan and European operations. Earned premiums decreased as ratings downgrades reduced payout annuity sales, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in benefits, losses, and loss adjustment expenses. Net investment income declined primarily in institutional products due to lower income on fixed maturities resulting from a decline in average interest rates on fixed maturity investments, as well as increased average assets held in short-term investment pools used to fund the calls and buyback strategy and increased partnership losses. The declines in the institutional products net investment income were partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest credited on liabilities reported in benefits, losses, and loss adjustment expenses. Net investment spread declined in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the decrease in earnings on fixed maturities, including the impact of interest rate hedges. Partnership earnings and other investing activities also declined lowering total spread by 7 bps. The decline in fixed maturity returns was primarily related to a higher percentage of fixed maturities being held in short-term investments and an overall decline in interest rates. Partially offsetting these declines in spread were decreases in crediting rates. The DAC amortization ratio, excluding net realized capital losses and DAC Unlocks, improved due to lower gross profits driven by decreases in equity market in 2008, and lower returns on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. Global Annuity effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to permanent differences for the separate account DRD on U.S. annuity products, as well as varying tax rates by country, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax benefits related to certain realized losses on securities that back certain institutional investment products. Income taxes include separate account DRD benefits of $142 in 2009 compared to $130 in 2008.

In addition, Life Insurance net income increased, excluding the improvements to net realized gains and an Unlock benefit, due to improvements in the segment individual life business. Life Insurance net realized gains in 2010 compared to net realized capital losses in 2009 were primarily due to lower losses from impairments. For further discussion on impairments, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Credit Risk section of the MD&A. The Unlock benefit was $28, after-tax, in 2010 as compared to an Unlock charge of $51, after-tax, in 2009. The benefit in 2010 was primarily due to assumption updates related to lapse rates, investment margin and mortality, partially offset by persistency, while 2009 charge was primarily the result of assumption updates related to investment margin and expenses, as well as equity market performance significantly below expectations in 2009, partially offset by assumption updates on lapse rates. The Unlock primarily resulted in decreases to amortization of DAC and fee income and other. For further discussion of the Unlock see the Critical Accounting Estimates within the MD&A. Life Insurance individual life business increased driven by improvements in net investment income primarily related to improved performance of limited partnerships and other alternative investment and earnings on a higher average invested asset base in 2010 compared to 2009, partially offset by lower yields on fixed maturity investments. Net investment spread for individual life variable universal life and universal life products increased primarily due to the improved performance of limited partnerships and other alternative investments for the year ended December 31, 2010. Life Insurance effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to permanent differences for the separate account DRD, partially offset by a valuation allowance on deferred tax benefits related to certain realized losses in 2010. Income taxes include separate account DRD benefits of $19 in 2010 compared to $24 in 2009. For further discussion, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Life Insurance net income in 2009 compared to a net loss in 2008 is primarily due increased fee income and other and lower net realized capital losses, as well as the impact of the effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of the Unlock during the first quarter of 2009. Fee income and other increased primarily due to the impact of the amortization of unearned revenue reserves of $83 within the 2009 Unlock and increased cost of insurance charges of $38 for individual life products, as a result of growth in guaranteed universal life insurance in-force, partially offset by lower variable life fees as a result of equity market declines. Life Insurance net realized losses decreased in 2009 compared to net realized losses in 2008 primarily due to lower impairments. For further discussion on impairments, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments within the Investment Credit Risk section of the MD&A. The Unlock charge was $51, after-tax, in 2009 as compared to an Unlock charge of $44, after-tax, in 2008. The charges related to assumption updates and the impact from equity market performance that was less than expectations was greater in 2009 than 2008. The Unlock primarily resulted in increases to amortization of DAC and an increase in fee income and other as discussed above. For further discussion of DAC Unlock see the Critical Accounting Estimates within the MD&A. Life Insurance effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to permanent differences for the separate account DRD. Income taxes include separate account DRD benefits of $24 in 2009 compared to $14 in 2008. For further discussion, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net investment spread for individual variable universal life and universal life products was lower due to a decline in investment income and an increase in interest credited. Interest credited increased due primarily to increased average account values, partially offset by a reduction in the average credited rate of 18 bps. 83 Table of Contents RETIREMENT PLANS Operating Summary 2010 2009 2008 Fee income and other $ 352 $ 321 $ 334 Earned premiums 7 3 4 Net investment income 364 315 342 Net realized capital losses (18 ) (333 ) (272 ) Total revenues 705 306 408 Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses 278 269 271 Insurance operating costs and other expenses 340 346 335 Amortization of DAC 27 56 91 Total benefits, losses and expenses 645 671 697 Income (loss) before income taxes 60 (365 ) (289 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 13 (143 ) (132 ) Net income (loss) $ 47 $ (222 ) $ (157 ) Assets Under Management 2010 2009 2008 401(k) account values $ 20,291 $ 16,142 $ 11,956 403(b)/457 account values 12,649 11,116 10,242 401(k)/403(b) mutual funds 19,578 16,704 14,838 Total assets under management $ 52,518 $ 43,962 $ 37,036 Total assets under administration 401(k) $ 4,448 $ 5,588 $ 5,122 Assets Under Management Roll Forward 2010 2009 2008 Assets under management, beginning of period $ 43,962 $ 37,036 $ 28,548 Net flows 1,545 (1,142 ) 1,972 Acquisitions [1] 18,725 Transfers in and reclassifications [2] 1,488 Change in market value and other 5,523 8,068 (12,209 ) Assets under management, end of period $ 52,518 $ 43,962 $ 37,036 Net Investment Spread 110 bps 66 bps 92 bps [1] In 2008, the Company acquired the rights to service mutual fund assets from Sun Life Retirement Services, Inc., and Princeton Retirement Group. [2] Lifetime Income and Maturity Funding business of $194 was transferred from Global Annuity to Retirement Plans effective January 1, 2010. Also in 2010, the Company identified specific plans that required reclassification of $1.3 billion from AUA to AUM. 84 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 Retirement Plans net income in 2010 compared to a net loss in 2009 primarily due to significant improvements in net realized capital losses, as well as higher net investment income and improvements in the equity markets which resulted in a DAC Unlock benefit in 2010 as compared to a DAC Unlock charge in 2009 and continued market value appreciation in AUM which resulted in increased fee income and other. Net realized capital losses were lower in 2010 compared to 2009 due to lower losses from impairments, derivatives, and trading losses compared to 2009. Net investment income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the improved performance from limited partnerships and other alternative investments and higher average general account invested assets compared to 2009. Correspondingly, the improvements in performance on limited partnerships and other alternative investments drove an increase in the net investment spread of 39 bps, partially offset by lower returns on fixed maturity securities. Net investment spread also improved due to lower crediting rates of 10 bps. The DAC Unlock benefit was $18, after-tax, in 2010 as compared to a DAC Unlock charge of $56, after-tax, in 2009. The benefit in 2010 was primarily due to assumption changes based on actual experience and to a lesser extent from the market performance variance to expectations for the year ended December 31, 2010, while 2009 charge was primarily the result assumption changes based on actual experience and equity market performance significantly below expectations. The DAC Unlock primarily resulted in a decrease to amortization of DAC. For further discussion of DAC Unlock see the Critical Accounting Estimates within the MD&A. Fee income and other increased primarily due to increases in asset based fees on higher average account values resulting from improvements in equity markets and increased net flows. Retirement Plans effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to permanent differences for the separate account DRD. Income taxes include separate account DRD benefits of $18 in 2010 compared to $15 in 2009. For further discussion, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Retirement Plans net loss increased due to an increase in net realized capital losses, lower net investment income, lower fee income and other and insurance operating costs and other expenses, partially offset by lower amortization of DAC. Net realized capital losses increased primarily as a result of realized losses of $56 on non-qualifying derivatives in 2009 compared with $14 of gains in 2008 and mortgage valuation allowances of $38 in 2009, partially offset by OTTI impairment losses of $178 in 2009 compared with $243 in 2008. Net investment income decreased primarily as a result of lower yields on fixed maturity investments, partially offset by an increase in derivative income. Net investment spread decline is attributable to lower fixed maturity returns of 34 bps and lower returns on limited partnerships and other alternative investments of 3 bps, partially offset by a reduction in credited rates of 10 bps. Fee income and other decreased primarily due to lower asset based fees on lower average account values. Despite equity market improvements during the last nine months of 2009, account values did not return to early 2008 levels. Additionally, net flows declined due to a few large case surrenders in 2009. Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased primarily due to a full year of operating expenses associated with the businesses acquired in 2008 and lower deferrable acquisition expenses due to low sales levels, partially offset by expense management initiatives. The DAC Unlock charge was $56, after-tax, in 2009 as compared to a DAC Unlock charge of $49, after-tax, in 2008. The charges in both periods primarily related to assumption changes based on actual experience and the variance in market performance compared to expectations. The DAC Unlock primarily resulted in a decrease to amortization of DAC and an increase in net realized capital losses. For further discussion of DAC Unlock see the Critical Accounting Estimates within the MD&A. Additionally, amortization of DAC decreased as a result of lower gross profits in 2009 than in 2008. Retirement Plans effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to permanent differences for the separate account DRD. Income taxes include separate account DRD benefits of $15 in 2009 compared to $32 in 2008.

[2] Proprietary mutual fund assets under management are included in the Mutual Fund reporting segment effective January 1, 2010. [3] Change in market value and other in 2010 includes the sale of Canadian mutual fund assets of approximately $1.8 billion. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 Net income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to net realized gain on the sale of Canadian mutual fund operations of $69, pre-tax, and higher overall account balances attributed to the improved equity markets, and positive net flows on non-proprietary and Canadian mutual fund assets, resulting in higher fee income, partially offset by higher trail commissions, as well as capital infusions to the money market funds. Also contributing to the net income in 2010 is the increase in scale of the reporting segment businesses. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 Net income decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower fee income and other driven by lower average account values. Despite equity market improvements during the last nine months of 2009, account values did not return to early 2008 levels. Also contributing to the net income in 2009 is the decrease in scale of the reporting segment businesses. 86 Table of Contents CORPORATE AND OTHER Operating Summary 2010 2009 2008 Earned premiums $ 3 $ (1 ) $ 8 Fee income [1] 187 220 227 Net investment income 268 344 308 Net realized capital gains (losses) 83 (433 ) (137 ) Other revenues 4 6 Total revenues 541 134 412 Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses 249 394 281 Insurance operating costs and other expenses [1] 382 365 220 Interest expense 508 476 343 Goodwill impairment 153 32 323 Total benefits, losses and expenses 1,292 1,267 1,167 Loss before income taxes (751 ) (1,133 ) (755 ) Income tax benefit (263 ) (329 ) (203 ) Net loss $ (488 ) $ (804 ) $ (552 ) [1] Fee income includes the income associated with the sales of non-proprietary insurance products in the Company broker-dealer subsidiaries that has an offsetting commission expense in insurance operating costs and other expenses. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 The net loss in Corporate and Other decreased primarily due to improvements in net realized capital gains (losses), partially offset by an increase in interest expense and goodwill impairments. The change to net realized capital gains, from net realized capital losses was due to impairments on investment securities recorded in 2009. In addition, 2009 included a net realized capital loss of approximately $300 as a result of a contingency payment made to Allianz due to the Company participation in the Capital Purchase Program. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on Allianz. Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $1.1 billion of senior notes in the first quarter of 2010. For further information, see Senior Notes within Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill impairments were recorded for Federal Trust Corporation goodwill in 2010 of $100, after-tax, in 2010 compared to impairments for the Institutional reporting unit in 2009 of $32, after-tax, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill impairments. The effective tax rate in 2009 differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate due to nondeductible costs associated with the contingency payment to Allianz and goodwill impairments. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The net loss in Corporate and Other increased primarily due to higher net realized capital losses and increases in interest expense and benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by a decrease in goodwill impairments. The net realized capital loss increased primarily due to approximately $300 in net realized losses a result of a contingency payment made to Allianz due to the Company participation in the Capital Purchase Program. Additionally, 2008 included realized gains of $110 on the change in fair value of the liability related to warrants issued to Allianz. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on Allianz. Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $1.75 billion of 10.0% junior subordinated debentures on October 17, 2008 partially offset by a reduction from debt repayments of $955 in 2008. Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased as the unfavorable prior year loss development in 2009 was higher than 2008. The 2009 reserve development included asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening of $138 and $75, respectively, while the 2008 reserve development included asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening of $50 and $53, respectively. Goodwill impairments were recorded for the Institutional reporting unit in 2009 of $32, after-tax, compared to impairments for the Individual Annuity and International reporting units in 2008 of $323, after-tax, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill impairments. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal statutory rate due to nondeductible costs associated with the contingency payment to Allianz in 2009, and with goodwill impairments in both 2009 and 2008. Also 2008 included tax exemption for the realized gains on the change in fair value of the liability related to warrants issued to Allianz. 87 Table of Contents INSURANCE RISK MANAGEMENT The Hartford has a robust set of enterprise risk management processes and controls around the management of insurance risks that are integrated into such core activities as underwriting, pricing, reinsurance, claims management, and capital management. In addition, to manage aggregations of insurance risk across the portfolio, The Hartford has policies and processes to manage risk related to natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes and earthquakes and pandemics, as well as man-made disasters such as terrorism. The Hartford risk management processes include, but are not limited to, disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. In managing risk, The Hartford management processes involve establishing underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and in aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. The Company establishes risk limits and actively monitors risk exposures as a percent of statutory surplus. Natural Catastrophes For natural catastrophe perils, the Company generally limits its estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance to less than 30% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty operations and its estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event after reinsurance to less than 15% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty operations. The Company uses third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the Company financial position and results of operations. The Company modeled loss estimates are derived by averaging 21 modeled loss events representing a 250-year return period loss. For the peril of earthquake, the 21 events averaged to determine the modeled loss estimate include events occurring in California as well as the Northwestern, Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States with associated magnitudes ranging from 6.1 to 7.9 on the Moment Magnitude scale. For the peril of hurricane, the 21 events averaged to determine the modeled loss estimate include category 3, 4 and 5 events in Florida, as well as other Southeastern and Northeastern region landfalls. While Enterprise Risk Management has a process to track and manage these limits, from time to time, the estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus. Currently, the Company estimated pre-tax loss to a single 250-year natural catastrophe event prior to reinsurance is less than 30% of the statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and the Company estimated pre-tax loss net of reinsurance is less than 15% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty operations. The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum losses from hurricane events are estimated to be $1.5 billion and $582 before and after reinsurance, respectively. The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum loss from earthquake events are estimated to be $666 before reinsurance and $434 net of reinsurance. The loss estimates represent total property losses for hurricane events and property and workers compensation losses for earthquake events resulting from a single event. The estimates provided are based on 250-year return period loss estimates, which have a 0.4% likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. The net loss estimates provided above assume that the Company is able to recover all losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. There are various methodologies used in the industry to estimate the potential property and workers compensation losses that would arise from various catastrophe events and companies may use different models and assumptions in their estimates. Therefore, the Company estimates of gross and net losses arising from a 250-year hurricane or earthquake event may not be comparable to estimates provided by other companies. Furthermore, the Company estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and could vary materially from the actual losses that would arise from these events and the loss estimates provided by other Companies. The company also manages natural catastrophe risk for group life, group disability, and individual life insurance, which in combination with property and workers compensation loss estimates, are subject to separate enterprise risk management net aggregate loss limits as a percent of enterprise surplus. Terrorism The Company is exposed to losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by single-site and multi-site conventional attacks, as well as the potential for attacks using nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons ( NBCR ) attacks. For terrorism, the Company monitors aggregations of exposure around key landmarks primarily in major metropolitan areas that span the Company insurance portfolio. Enterprise limits for terrorism apply to aggregations of risk across property-casualty, group benefits, life insurance and specific asset portfolios and are defined based on a deterministic, single-site conventional terrorism attack scenario. The Company manages its potential estimated loss from this terrorism loss scenario to less than $1.3 billion. Among the landmark locations specifically monitored by the Company as of December 31, 2010, the largest estimated modeled loss arising from a single event is approximately $1.1 billion. The Company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline. The risk of terrorism presents unique challenges to any insurance company given the fact that the frequency and severity of terrorist attacks are highly uncertain and potentially unknowable. As such, modeled terrorism losses could differ materially from scenarios employed to manage the Company overall terrorism risk loss exposure. 88 Table of Contents Pandemic Pandemic risk is the exposure to loss in the Company market value, earnings or surplus arising from widespread influenza or other pathogens or bacterial infections that create an aggregation of loss across the Company insurance or asset portfolios. Consistent with industry practice, The Hartford assesses exposure to pandemics by analyzing the potential impact from a variety of pandemic scenarios based on conditions consistent with earlier outbreaks of flu-like viruses, including the Severe 1918 Spanish Flu, the Asian flu in 1957, the Hong Kong flu in 1968, and the 2009 outbreak of swine flu. In evaluating these scenarios, The Hartford assesses the impact on group and individual life policies, short-term and long-term disability, annuities, COLI, property & casualty claims, and losses in the investment portfolio associated market declines in the event of a widespread pandemic. Given the evolving science around the risk of pandemics, the Company has not adopted formal limits for pandemic but continues to manage the risk of pandemic exposures within acceptable management tolerances. Reinsurance In managing risk, The Hartford utilizes reinsurance to transfer risk to well-established and financially secure reinsurers. Reinsurance is used to manage aggregations of risk as well as to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. All reinsurance processes are aligned under a single enterprise reinsurance governance policy with treaty purchases administered by a centralized function within Commercial and Consumer Markets and Wealth Management to support a consistent strategy and to ensure that the reinsurance activities are fully integrated into the organization risk management processes. A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that protect property and workers compensation exposures, and individual risk or quota share arrangements, that protect specific classes or lines of business. The Company has no significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. Facultative reinsurance is used by the Company to manage policy-specific risk exposures based on established underwriting guidelines. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ( FHCF ), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program established under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 ( TRIPRA ) and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business. The Company has several catastrophe reinsurance programs, including reinsurance treaties that cover property and workers compensation losses aggregating from single catastrophe events. The following table summarizes the primary catastrophe treaty reinsurance coverages that the Company has in place as of February 18, 2011: % of layer(s) Coverage Treaty term reinsured Per occurrence limit Retention Principal property catastrophe program covering property catastrophe losses from a single event 1/1/2011 to 1/1/2012 90 % $ 750 $ 350 Reinsurance with the FHCF covering Florida Personal Lines property catastrophe losses from a single event 6/1/2010 to 6/1/2011 90 % 175[ 1] 64 Workers compensation losses arising from a single catastrophe event [2] 7/1/2010 to 7/1/2011 95 % 300 50 [1] The per occurrence limit on the FHCF treaty is $175 for the 6/1/2010 to 6/1/2011 treaty year based on the Company election to purchase the required coverage from FHCF. For 2010/11, the Company elected not to purchase additional limits under the Temporary Increase in Coverage Limit (TICL) statutory provision. [2] In addition, the Company also purchased an industrial accident only WC coverage for the 7/1/2010 to 7/1/2011 treaty year providing reinsurance of 80% of $30 of per occurrence limit in excess of $20. In addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the Company has other catastrophe and working layer treaties and facultative reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses on an aggregate excess of loss and on a per risk basis. The principal property catastrophe reinsurance program and other reinsurance programs include a provision to reinstate limits in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties. In addition to the reinsurance protection provided by The Hartford traditional property catastrophe reinsurance program described above, the Company has fully collateralized reinsurance coverages from Foundation Re III for losses sustained from qualifying hurricane loss events. Under the terms of the treaties, the Company is reimbursed for losses from hurricanes using customized industry index contracts designed to replicate The Hartford own catastrophe losses, with a provision that the actual losses incurred by the Company for covered events, net of reinsurance recoveries, cannot be less than zero. 89 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the terms of the reinsurance treaties with Foundation Re III that were in place as of February 21, 2011: Bond amount issued Covered perils Treaty term Covered losses by Foundation Re III Hurricane loss events affecting the Gulf and Eastern Coast of the United States 1/27/2010 to 1/27/2014 90% of $200 in losses in excess of an index loss trigger equating to approximately $1.2 billion in losses to The Hartford $ 180 Hurricane loss events affecting the Gulf and Eastern Coast of the United States 2/18/2011 to 2/18/2015 67.5% of $200 in losses in excess of an index loss trigger equating to approximately $1.4 billion in losses to The Hartford 135 As of February 21, 2011, there have been no events that are expected to trigger a recovery under the Foundation Re III reinsurance program and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any recoveries from the associated reinsurance treaty. For the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons attacks. As such, the Company principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through the TRIPRA. On December 26, 2007, the President signed TRIPRA extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 ( TRIA ) through the end of 2014. TRIPRA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any act of terrorism certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, that result in industry losses in excess of $100. In addition, TRIPRA revised the TRIA definition of a certified act of terrorism by removing the requirement that an act be committed on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest. As a result, domestic acts of terrorism can now be certified as acts of terrorism under the program, subject to the other requirements of TRIPRA. Under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government would pay 85% of covered losses from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer losses exceed 20% of the company eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, a future Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid. Among other items, TRIPRA required that the President Working Group on Financial Markets ( PWG ) continue to perform an analysis regarding the long-term availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risk. Among the findings detailed in the PWG initial report, released October 2, 2006, were that the high level of uncertainty associated with predicting the frequency of terrorist attacks, coupled with the unwillingness of some insurance policyholders to purchase insurance coverage, makes predicting long-term development of the terrorism risk market difficult, and that there is likely little potential for future market development for NBCR coverage. The January 2011 PWG report notes some improvements in capacity and modeling, but also noted that take-up rates for terrorism coverage remained relatively flat over the past three years and that insurers remain uncertain about the ability of models to predict the frequency and severity of terrorist attacks. With respect to NBCR coverage, a December 2008 study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) found that property and casualty insurers still generally seek to exclude NBCR coverage from their commercial policies when permitted. However, while nuclear, pollution and contamination exclusions are contained in many property and liability insurance policies, the GAO report concluded that such exclusions may be subject to challenges in court because they were not specifically drafted to address terrorist attacks. Furthermore, workers compensation policies generally have no exclusions or limitations. The GAO found that commercial property and casualty policyholders, including companies that own high-value properties in large cities, generally reported that they could not obtain NBCR coverage. Commercial property and casualty insurers generally remain unwilling to offer NBCR coverage because of uncertainties about the risk and the potential for catastrophic losses. Reinsurance Recoverables Reinsurance Security To manage the potential credit risk resulting from the use of reinsurance, management and ERM evaluate the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer through a regular enterprise security review committee. Through this process, the Company maintains a centralized list of reinsurers approved for participation on all treaty and facultative reinsurance placements. Only reinsurance companies approved through this process are eligible to participate on new reinsurance cessions. The Company approval designations reflect the differing credit exposure associated with various classes of business. Participation authorizations are categorized based upon the nature of the reinsurance risk and the expected liability payout duration. In addition to defining participation eligibility, the Company regularly monitors each active reinsurer credit risk exposure in the aggregate relative to expected and stressed levels of exposure and has established limits tiered by credit rating. Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reinsurance Recoverable Property and casualty insurance product reinsurance recoverables represent loss and loss adjustment expense recoverable from a number of entities, including reinsurers and pools. The following table shows the components of the gross and net reinsurance recoverable as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: Reinsurance Recoverable December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Paid loss and loss adjustment expenses $ 198 $ 208 Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 2,963 3,321 Gross reinsurance recoverable 3,161 3,529 Less: allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (290 ) (335 ) Net reinsurance recoverable $ 2,871 $ 3,194 90 Table of Contents As shown in the following table, a portion of the total gross reinsurance recoverable relates to the Company mandatory participation in various involuntary assigned risk pools and the value of annuity contracts held under structured settlement agreements. Reinsurance recoverables due from mandatory pools are backed by the financial strength of the property and casualty insurance industry. Annuities purchased from third-party life insurers under structured settlements are recognized as reinsurance recoverables in cases where the Company has not obtained a release from the claimant. Of the remaining gross reinsurance recoverable as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the following table shows the portion of recoverables due from companies rated by A.M. Best. Distribution of gross reinsurance recoverable December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Gross reinsurance recoverable $ 3,161 $ 3,529 Less: mandatory (assigned risk) pools and structured settlements (614 ) (642 ) Gross reinsurance recoverable excluding mandatory pools and structured settlements $ 2,547 $ 2,887 % of Total % of Total Rated A- (Excellent) or better by A.M.

Best ratings as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company reinsurers. Due largely to investment losses sustained by reinsurers in 2008, the financial strength ratings of some reinsurers have been downgraded and the financial strength ratings of other reinsurers have been put on negative watch. Nevertheless, as indicated in the above table, approximately 98% of the gross reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers rated by A.M. Best were rated A- (excellent) or better as of December 31, 2010. Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before such amounts will be due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period. Annually, the Company completes evaluations of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Other Operations operating segment, and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reported in the Property & Casualty Commercial reporting segment. For a discussion regarding the results of these evaluations, see Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance within the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A. Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance Assessments In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, members of the funds are assessed to pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer. A particular state fund assesses its members based on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state. The amount and timing of assessments related to past insolvencies is unpredictable. Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in Florida ( Citizens ) provides property insurance to Florida homeowners and businesses that are unable to obtain insurance from other carriers, including for properties deemed to be high risk . Citizens maintains a Personal Lines account, a Commercial Lines account and a High Risk account. If Citizens incurs a deficit in any of these accounts, Citizens may impose a regular assessment on other insurance carriers in the state to fund the deficits, subject to certain restrictions and subject to approval by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Carriers are then permitted to surcharge policyholders to recover the assessments over the next few years. Citizens may also opt to finance a portion of the deficits through issuing bonds and may impose emergency assessments on other insurance carriers to fund the bond repayments. Unlike with regular assessments, however, insurance carriers only serve as a collection agent for emergency assessments and are not required to remit surcharges for emergency assessments to Citizens until they collect surcharges from policyholders. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to accrue for regular assessments in the period the assessments become probable and estimable and the obligating event has occurred. Surcharges to recover the amount of regular assessments may not be recorded as an asset until the related premium is written. Emergency assessments that may be levied by Citizens are not recorded in the income statement. 91 Table of Contents INVESTMENT CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Investment credit risk is viewed by the Company as the set of credit risks that can impair the value of the investment portfolio. This includes default risk, credit transition risk, systemic credit risk, idiosyncratic risk, and counterparty risk. Default risk is the risk of loss of principal and/or interest income stemming from a debt issuer failure to meet their contractual obligations. Credit transition risk is the risk that an investment declines in creditworthiness after purchase. Typically, the decline in creditworthiness is associated with an increase in credit spreads associated with the investment, potentially resulting in increases in other-than temporary impairments and the increased probability of a realized loss. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the financial institution, clearing exchange, or other party with whom the Company has entered into a financial contract will default on the obligation and fail to meet their contractual obligations. This is a significant risk in over-the-counter derivatives trading, and futures trading. The Company has established an enterprise credit policy that views credit risk across the enterprise both at the single obligor level and at the portfolio level across multiple lenses. The portfolio view includes measures of the exposure to loss of statutory surplus, and the exposure to changes in economy. The single obligor measures are also aggregated across the enterprise, and include exposures generated from the investment portfolio, the insurance and reinsurance businesses, and any collateral short-falls. Limits are set prudentially, and size of limit is impacted by an institution probability to default. Counterparty credit risk is mitigated both through the practice of entering into contracts only with highly creditworthy institutions, but also through the practice of holding and posting of collateral, and including collateral short-falls in the exposure calculations. Systemic credit risk is mitigated through the construction of a high-quality, diverse portfolio of investments that are subject to regular underwriting of the risks. Additional limits on investment activity, including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels, is subject to regular review and approval by Enterprise Risk Management and senior management. The Company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including borrower, issuer and counterparty. Creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness, typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies and is supplemented by an internal credit evaluation. Obligor, asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established Company limits and are monitored on a regular basis. The Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the Company stockholders equity other than U.S. government and government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivative Instruments In the normal course of business, the Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction. The Company has developed a derivative counterparty exposure policy which limits the Company exposure to credit risk. The derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties rated A2/A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company risk management team and reviewed by senior management. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company also generally requires that derivative contracts, other than exchange traded contracts, certain forward contracts, and certain embedded and reinsurance derivatives, be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified daily based on the prior business day market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds the contractual thresholds. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on the next business day. The Company has exposure to credit risk for amounts below the exposure thresholds which are uncollateralized, as well as for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual settlement periods of collateral movements. The maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is $10. The Company currently transacts over-the-counter derivatives in five legal entities and therefore the maximum combined threshold for a single counterparty across all legal entities that use derivatives is $50. In addition, the Company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family due to a common credit support provider. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum combined threshold for all counterparties under a single credit support provider across all legal entities that use derivatives is $100. Based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds may be immediately reduced due to a downgrade in either party credit rating. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments Section of Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company has incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default. In addition to counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into credit default swaps to manage credit exposure. Credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk of one or many referenced entities from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments. The party that purchases credit protection will make periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount, and for certain transactions there will also be an upfront premium payment. The second party, who assumes credit risk, will typically only make a payment if there is a credit event as defined in the contract and such payment will be typically equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security issuer debt obligation. A credit event is generally defined as default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection and assume credit risk with respect to a single entity, referenced index, or asset pool. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. The Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that would otherwise be permissible investments under the Company investment policies. These swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include customized diversified portfolios of corporate issuers, which are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches which possess different credit ratings. 92 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $2.6 billion, while the fair value was $(9) and $(50), respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $2.6 and $1.2 billion, respectively, while the fair value was $(434) and $(240), respectively. For further information on credit derivatives, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments The following table presents the Company fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality.

This was partially offset by rating agency downgrades primarily associated with commercial real estate ( CRE ) collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ), commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ) and securities in the financial services sector. Fixed maturities, FVO, are not included in the above table as of December 31, 2010.

[2] Gross unrealized gains (losses) exclude the fair value of bifurcated embedded derivative features of certain securities. Subsequent changes in value will be recorded in net realized capital gains (losses). The Company continues to rebalance its AFS investment portfolio to securities with more favorable risk/return profiles, in particular investment grade corporate securities, while reducing its exposure to real estate related securities. The Company AFS net unrealized position improved primarily as a result of improved security valuations largely due to a decline in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, credit spread tightening. Fixed maturities, FVO, represents securities containing an embedded credit derivative for which the Company elected the fair value option. The underlying credit risk of these securities is primarily high quality corporate bonds and CRE CDOs. For further discussion on the election of fair value option, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections highlight the Company significant investment sectors. 94 Table of Contents Financial Services The Company exposure to the financial services sector is predominantly through banking institutions. The following table presents the Company exposure to the financial services sector included in the Securities by Type table above. December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Amortized Net Amortized Net Cost Fair Value Unrealized Cost Fair Value Unrealized AAA $ 302 $ 309 $ 7 $ 299 $ 290 $ (9 ) AA 2,085 2,095 10 1,913 1,867 (46 ) A 3,760 3,599 (161 ) 4,510 3,987 (523 ) BBB 1,677 1,518 (159 ) 1,664 1,379 (285 ) BB & below 290 253 (37 ) 509 416 (93 ) Total $ 8,114 $ 7,774 $ (340 ) $ 8,895 $ 7,939 $ (956 ) The improvement in the net unrealized loss position was attributed to improved security valuations resulting from increasing confidence in this sector. During the second half of 2010, companies within the financial sectors generally continued to stabilize with improved earnings performance, positive credit trends and strengthened capital and liquidity positions. Both the Dodd-Frank Act and clarification around Basel III capital requirements will strengthen capital standards prospectively. Despite these positive impacts, the financial sector remains vulnerable to ongoing stress in the real estate markets including mortgage put-back and foreclosure risks, high unemployment and global economic uncertainty, which could potentially result in declines in the Company net unrealized position. In 2011, the Company expects a continuation of stabilizing trends seen in 2010 as the regulatory landscape becomes more visible, credit quality continues on an improving path, although likely at a slower rate, and capital and liquidity management remains conservative. Commercial Real Estate During the fourth quarter, the commercial real estate market continued to show signs of improving fundamentals, such as increases in market pricing, tightening credit spreads and more readily available financing. Although delinquencies remain high, they are expected to increase at a slower pace before moving lower in late 2011. The Company continues to reduce its exposure to real estate related securities through sales and maturities. The following table presents the Company exposure to CMBS bonds by current credit quality and vintage year, included in the Securities by Type table above. Credit protection represents the current weighted average percentage of the outstanding capital structure subordinated to the Company investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of principal and excludes any equity interest or property value in excess of outstanding debt.

These loans are collateralized by a variety of commercial properties and are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These loans may be either in the form of a whole loan, where the Company is the sole lender, or a loan participation. Loan participations are loans where the Company has purchased or retained a portion of an outstanding loan or package of loans and participates on a pro-rata basis in collecting interest and principal pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement. In general, A-Note participations have senior payment priority, followed by B-Note participations and then mezzanine loan participations. As of December 31, 2010, loans within the Company mortgage loan portfolio have had minimal extension or restructurings.

Since December 31, 2009, the Company significantly reduced its exposure to B-Note participations and mezzanine loans by $1.1 billion primarily through sales. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had mortgage loans held-for-sale with a carrying value and valuation allowance of $87 and $7, respectively. During 2010, the Company funded $255 of commercial whole loans focusing on loans with strong loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios and high quality property collateral. At origination, these loans had a weighted average LTV of 60% and a weighted average yield of 5.0%. For a discussion of outstanding mortgage loan commitments, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations within the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A and Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Municipal Bonds The Company holds investments in securities backed by states, municipalities and political subdivisions ( municipal ) with an amortized cost and fair value of $12.5 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010 and $12.1 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. The Company municipal bond portfolio is well diversified and primarily consists of essential service revenue and general obligation bonds. During 2010, purchases in this sector were concentrated in essential service revenue bonds and general obligation bonds with an average credit quality rating of AA. Sales during 2010 were concentrated in lower quality bonds or to reduce exposure in higher risk states such as California, Illinois and Florida. As of December 31, 2010, the largest issuer concentrations were in California, Georgia and Massachusetts, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation securities. As of December 31, 2009, the largest issuer concentrations were in California, Georgia and Illinois, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation securities. Limited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments The following table presents the Company investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include hedge funds, mortgage and real estate funds, mezzanine debt funds, and private equity and other funds. Hedge funds include investments in funds of funds and direct funds. Mortgage and real estate funds consist of investments in funds whose assets consist of mortgage loans, mortgage loan participations, mezzanine loans or other notes which may be below investment grade, as well as equity real estate and real estate joint ventures. Mezzanine debt funds include investments in funds whose assets consist of subordinated debt that often incorporates equity-based options such as warrants and a limited amount of direct equity investments. Private equity and other funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small non-public businesses with high growth potential.

The increase in mortgage and real estate funds was mainly attributed to additional funding of existing partnerships. Available-for-Sale Securities Unrealized Loss Aging As part of the Company ongoing security monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its AFS securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that there were no additional impairments as of December 31, 2010 and that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as real estate related market spreads return to more normalized levels. Most of the securities depressed over 20% for greater than nine months are structured securities with exposure to commercial and residential real estate, as well as certain floating rate corporate securities or those securities with greater than 10 years to maturity, concentrated in the financial services sector. Both financial and structured securities have a weighted average current rating of BBB. Current market spreads continue to be significantly wider for structured securities with exposure to commercial and residential real estate, as compared to spreads at the security respective purchase date, largely due to the economic and market uncertainties regarding future performance of commercial and residential real estate. The Company reviewed these securities as part of its impairment analysis. The Company best estimate of future cash flows utilized in its impairment analysis involves both macroeconomic and security specific assumptions that may differ based on security type, vintage year and property location including, but not limited to, historical and projected default and recovery rates, current and expected future delinquency rates and property value declines. For these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the Company best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. The same market conditions noted above also apply to AFS securities depressed over 50% for greater than twelve months, which consist primarily of structured securities with exposure to commercial and residential real estate. Based upon the Company cash flow modeling and current market and collateral performance assumptions, these securities have sufficient credit protection levels to receive contractually obligated principal and interest payments, and accordingly the Company has concluded that no credit impairment exists on these securities. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. For the CRE CDOs and CMBS which are included in the AFS securities depressed over 50% for greater than twelve months, current market pricing reflects market illiquidity and higher risk premiums. The illiquidity and risk premiums are the result of the underlying collateral performance to date and the potential uncertainty in the securities future cash flows. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the future performance of commercial real estate, market participants in many cases are requiring substantially greater returns, in comparison to the securities stated coupon rate, to assume the associated securities credit risk. If the securities collateral underperforms macroeconomic and collateral assumptions in the future, loss severities may be significant as a result of the security contractual terms. In addition, the majority of these securities have a floating-rate coupon referenced to a market index such as LIBOR. When the reference rate declines, the valuation of the respective security may also decline. LIBOR rates have declined substantially after these CRE CDOs and CMBS were purchased.

For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 ABS $ 13 $ 54 $ 27 CDOs CREs 164 483 398 Other 28 CMBS Bonds 157 257 141 IOs 3 25 61 Corporate 33 198 1,852 Equity 14 145 1,161 Foreign govt./govt. agencies 31 Municipal 1 18 21 RMBS Non-agency 2 4 13 Alt-A 10 62 24 Sub-prime 37 232 235 U.S. Treasuries 2 Total $ 434 $ 1,508 $ 3,964 Year ended December 31, 2010 For the year ended December 31, 2010, impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of credit impairments of $372, impairments on debt securities for which the Company intends to sel1 of $54 and impairments on equity securities of $8. Credit impairments were primarily concentrated in structured securities associated with commercial and residential real estate which were impaired primarily due to continued property-specific deterioration of the underlying collateral and increased delinquencies. The Company calculated these impairments utilizing both a top down modeling approach and, for certain commercial real estate backed securities, a loan by loan collateral review. The top down modeling approach used discounted cash flow models that considered losses under current and expected future economic conditions. Assumptions used over the current period included macroeconomic factors, such as a high unemployment rate, as well as sector specific factors such as property value declines, commercial real estate delinquency levels and changes in net operating income. Those assumptions included CMBS peak-to-trough property value declines, on average, of 36% and RMBS peak-to-trough property value declines, on average, of 35%. The macroeconomic assumptions considered by the Company did not materially change from the previous several quarters and, as such, the credit impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2010 were largely driven by actual or expected collateral deterioration, largely as a result of the Company loan-by-loan collateral review. 98 Table of Contents The loan-by-loan collateral review is performed to estimate potential future losses. This review incorporates assumptions about expected future collateral cash flows, including projected rental rates and occupancy levels that varied based on property type and sub-market. The results of the loan by loan collateral review allowed the Company to estimate the expected timing of a security first loss, if any, and the probability and severity of potential ultimate losses. The Company then discounted these anticipated future cash flows at the security book yield prior to impairment. The results of cash flow modeling utilized by the Company result in cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year. For the 2007 vintage year, the Company cash flow modeling resulted in cumulative collateral loss rates for CMBS and sub-prime RMBS of approximately 12% and 44%, respectively. Impairments on securities for which the Company had the intent to sell were primarily on CMBS bonds in order to take advantage of price appreciation. Impairments on equity securities were primarily on below investment grade securities that have been depressed 20% for more than six months. In addition to the credit impairments recognized in earnings, the Company recognized non-credit impairments in other comprehensive income of $418 for the year ended December 31, 2010, predominantly concentrated in CRE CDOs and RMBS. These non-credit impairments represent the difference between fair value and the Company best estimate of expected future cash flows discounted at the security effective yield prior to impairment, rather than at current market implied credit spreads. These non-credit impairments primarily represent increases in market liquidity premiums and credit spread widening that occurred after the securities were purchased, as well as a discount for variable-rate coupons which are paying less than at purchase date. In general, larger liquidity premiums and wider credit spreads are the result of deterioration of the underlying collateral performance of the securities, as well as the risk premium required to reflect future uncertainty in the real estate market. Future impairments may develop as the result of changes in intent to sell of specific securities or if actual results underperform current modeling assumptions, which may be the result of, but are not limited to, macroeconomic factors, and property performance below current expectations. Recent improvements in commercial real estate property valuations will positively impact future loss development, with future impairments driven by idiosyncratic security specific risk. Year ended December 31, 2009 Impairments recognized in earnings were comprised of credit impairments of $1.2 billion primarily concentrated on CRE CDOs, below-prime RMBS and CMBS bonds. Also included were impairments on debt securities for which the Company intended to sell of $156, mainly comprised of corporate financial services securities, as well as impairments on equity securities of $136 related to below investment grade hybrid securities. Year ended December 31, 2008 Impairments were primarily concentrated on subordinated fixed maturities and preferred equities within the financial services sector, as well as in sub-prime RMBS and CRE CDOs. The remaining impairments were primarily recorded on securities in various sectors that experienced significant credit spread widening and for which the Company was uncertain of its intent to retain the investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery. Valuation Allowances on Mortgage Loans The following table presents additions to valuation allowances on mortgage loans. For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Credit-related concerns $ 70 $ 310 $ 26 Held for sale Agricultural loans 10 4 B-note participations 22 51 Mezzanine loans 52 43 Residential 3 Total $ 157 $ 408 $ 26 For the year ended December 31, 2010, additions of $157 primarily related to anticipated, and since executed, B-Note participant and mezzanine loan sales. Also included were additions for expected credit losses due to borrower financial difficulty and/or collateral deterioration. Recent improvements in commercial real estate property valuations will positively impact future loss development, with future impairments driven by idiosyncratic security specific risk. 99 Table of Contents CAPITAL MARKETS RISK MANAGEMENT The Company has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and asset/liability management activities. Investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on specific classes of investments. The Company invests in various types of investments, including derivative instruments, in order to meet its portfolio objectives. Derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established Company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management. The Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter and exchange traded derivative instruments as a part of its overall risk management strategy, as well as to enter into replication transactions. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk associated with interest rate, equity market, credit spread, issuer default, price, and currency exchange rate risk or volatility. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that would otherwise be permissible investments under the Company investment policies. For further information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. For further information on the Company use of derivatives, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates, credit spreads including issuer defaults, equity prices or market indices, and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is also exposed to credit and counterparty repayment risk. Derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established Company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management. Interest Rate Risk The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that maintain asset allocation limits and asset/liability duration matching targets which may include the use of derivatives. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flow simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios, which may include derivative instruments. Measures the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration. Duration is the price sensitivity of a financial instrument or series of cash flows to a parallel change in the underlying yield curve used to value the financial instrument or series of cash flows. For example, a duration of 5 means the price of the security will change by approximately 5% for a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Convexity is used to approximate how the duration of a security changes as interest rates change in a parallel manner. Key rate duration analysis measures the price sensitivity of a security or series of cash flows to each point along the yield curve and enables the Company to estimate the price change of a security assuming non-parallel interest rate movements. To calculate duration, convexity, and key rate durations, projections of asset and liability cash flows are discounted to a present value using interest rate assumptions. These cash flows are then revalued at alternative interest rate levels to determine the percentage change in fair value due to an incremental change in the entire yield curve for duration and convexity, or a particular point on the yield curve for key rate duration. Cash flows from corporate obligations are assumed to be consistent with the contractual payment streams on a yield to worst basis. Yield to worst is a basis that represents the lowest potential yield that can be received without the issuer actually defaulting. The primary assumptions used in calculating cash flow projections include expected asset payment streams taking into account prepayment speeds, issuer call options and contract holder behavior. Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are modeled based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities. These estimates are developed by incorporating collateral surveillance and anticipated future market dynamics. Actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates. The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk based upon the discount rate assumption associated with the Company pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve comprised of bonds rated Aa with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years. For further discussion of interest rate risk associated with the benefit obligations, see the Critical Accounting Estimates Section of the MD&A under Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, management evaluates performance of certain Wealth Management products based on net investment spread which is, in part, influenced by changes in interest rates. For further discussion, see the Global Annuity, Life Insurance, and Retirement Plans sections of the MD&A. 100 Table of Contents An increase in interest rates from the current levels is generally a favorable development for the Company. Rate increases are expected to provide additional net investment income, increase sales of fixed rate Wealth Management investment products, reduce the cost of the variable annuity hedging program, limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum guaranteed crediting rates in certain Wealth Management products and, if sustained, could reduce the Company prospective pension expense. Conversely, a rise in interest rates will reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio, increase interest expense on the Company variable rate debt obligations and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain Wealth Management businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment requiring the Company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. In conjunction with the interest rate risk measurement and management techniques, certain of Wealth Management fixed income product offerings have market value adjustment provisions at contract surrender. An increase in interest rates may also impact the Company tax planning strategies and in particular its ability to utilize tax benefits to offset certain previously recognized realized capital losses. A decline in interest rates results in certain mortgage-backed securities being more susceptible to paydowns and prepayments. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields. Lower interest rates will also likely result in lower net investment income, increased hedging cost associated with variable annuities and, if declines are sustained for a long period of time, it may subject the Company to reinvestment risks, higher pension costs expense and possibly reduced profit margins associated with guaranteed crediting rates on certain Wealth Management products. Conversely, the fair value of the investment portfolio will increase when interest rates decline and the Company interest expense will be lower on its variable rate debt obligations. The investments and liabilities primarily associated with interest rate risk are included in the following discussion. Certain product liabilities, including those containing GMWB, GMIB, GMAB, or GMDB, expose the Company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk. These liabilities are discussed as part of the Equity Risk section below. Fixed Maturity Investments The Company investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade fixed maturity securities. The fair value of these investments was $78.4 billion and $71.2 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of these and other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions. The weighted average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately 5.4 and 4.9 years as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Liabilities The Company investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed investment contracts, other investment and universal life-type contracts and certain insurance products such as long-term disability. Asset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of time. Product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment feature and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts. The term to maturity of these contracts generally range from less than one year to ten years. In addition, certain products such as universal life contracts and the general account portion of Wealth Management variable annuity products, credit interest to policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. The term to maturity of the asset portfolio supporting these products may range from short to intermediate. While interest rate risk associated with many of these products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns. The Company also manages the risk of certain insurance liabilities similarly to investment type products due to the relative predictability of the aggregate cash flow payment streams. Products in this category may contain significant reliance upon actuarial (including mortality and morbidity) pricing assumptions and do have some element of cash flow uncertainty. Product examples include structured settlement contracts, on-benefit annuities (i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon) and short-term and long-term disability contracts. The cash outflows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments. The primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and/or that the actual timing of the cash flows will differ from those anticipated, or interest rate levels may deviate from those assumed in product pricing, ultimately resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing. The average duration of the liability cash flow payments can range from less than one year to in excess of fifteen years. Derivatives The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies its asset/liability duration matching policy. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. Forward rate agreements are used to convert interest receipts on floating-rate securities to fixed rates. These derivatives are used to lock in the forward interest rate curve and reduce income volatility that results from changes in interest rates. Interest rate caps, floors, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk totaled $19.3 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively ($18.9 billion and $19.7 billion, respectively, related to investments and $0.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, related to Wealth Management liabilities). The fair value of these derivatives was $(372) and $18 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 101 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity The before-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts (e.g., fixed annuity contracts) issued by the Company Wealth Management operations and certain insurance product liabilities (e.g., short-term and long-term disability contracts) issued by the Company Commercial Markets operations, for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and the investment experience is substantially absorbed by the Company operations, along with the corresponding invested assets are included in the following table. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of certain insurance products, such as auto, property, whole and term life insurance, and certain life contingent annuities. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact that the investments are accounted for under the equity method and generally lack sensitivity to interest rate changes. Separate account assets and liabilities, equity securities, trading and the corresponding liabilities associated with the variable annuity products sold in Japan are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate accounts accrue to policyholders. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve. Change in Net Economic Value As of December 31, 2010 2009 Basis point shift - 100 + 100 - 100 + 100 Amount $ (190 ) $ 96 $ (30 ) $ (9 ) The fixed liabilities included above represented approximately 47% and 63% of the Company general account liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines, and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements. The following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before-tax change in the fair value of the Company fixed maturity investments and related derivatives, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact that the investments are accounted for under the equity method and generally lack sensitivity to interest rate changes. Change in Fair Value As of December 31, 2010 2009 Basis point shift - 100 + 100 - 100 + 100 Amount $ 2,988 $ (2,774 ) $ 2,326 $ (2,230 ) The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio and through counterparties. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument or contract. The Company manages credit risk through established investment credit policies which address quality of obligors and counterparties, credit concentration limits, diversification requirements and acceptable risk levels under expected and stressed scenarios. These policies are regularly reviewed and approved by the Enterprise Risk Management group and senior management. The Company is also exposed to credit spread risk related to security market price and cash flows associated with changes in credit spreads. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities and increase the fair value of the investment portfolio. Credit spread widening will reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio and will increase net investment income on new purchases. If issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an extended period of time, it may result in higher impairment losses. For further discussion of sectors most significantly impacted, see the Investment Credit Risk Section of the MD&A. Also, for a discussion of the movement of credit spread impacts on the Company statutory financial results as it relates to the accounting and reporting for market value fixed annuities, see the Capital Resources & Liquidity Section of the MD&A. 102 Table of Contents Equity Risk The Company primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of the Wealth Management businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. For further discussion of equity risk, see the Variable Product Equity Risk section below. In addition, Wealth Management offers certain guaranteed benefits, primarily associated with variable annuity products, which increases the Company potential benefit exposure as the equity markets decline. The Company is also subject to equity risk based upon the assets that support its pension plans. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the pension plans have certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investment options. For further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A under Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Variable Product Equity Risk The Company variable products are significantly influenced by the U.S., Japanese, and other global equity markets. Increases or declines in equity markets impact certain assets and liabilities related to the Company variable products and the Company earnings derived from those products. The Company variable products include variable annuity contracts, mutual funds, and variable life insurance. Generally, declines in equity markets will: reduce the value of assets under management and the amount of fee income generated from those assets; reduce the value of equity securities trading supporting the international variable annuities, the related policyholder funds and benefits payable, and the amount of fee income generated from those variable annuities; increase the liability for GMWB benefits resulting in realized capital losses; increase the value of derivative assets used to hedge product guarantees resulting in realized capital gains; increase the costs of the hedging instruments we use in our hedging program; increase the Company net amount at risk for GMDB and GMIB benefits; decrease the Company actual gross profits, resulting in increased DAC amortization; increase the amount of required assets to be held backing variable annuity guarantees to maintain required regulatory reserve levels and targeted risk based capital ratios; adversely affect customer sentiment toward equity-linked products, causing a decline in sales; and decrease the Company estimated future gross profits. See Estimated Gross Profits Used in the Valuation and Amortization of Assets and Liabilities Associated with Variable Annuity and Other Universal Life-Type Contracts within the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A for further information. Generally, increases in equity markets will reduce the value of derivative assets used to provide a macro hedge on statutory surplus, resulting in realized capital losses during periods of market appreciation. GMWB The majority of the Company U.S. and U.K. variable annuities, and a small portion of Japan variable annuities, include a GMWB rider. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company suspended all new sales in the U.K. and Japan. The Company new variable annuity product, launched in the U.S. in October 2009 does not offer a GMWB. Declines in equity markets will generally increase the Company liability for the in-force GMWB riders. As of December 31, 2010, U.S. GMWB account value was $44.8 billion and International GMWB account value was $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2009, U.S. GMWB account value was $45.5 billion and International GMWB account value was $2.7 billion. A GMWB contract is in the money if the contract holder guaranteed remaining benefit ( GRB ) is greater than their current account value. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, 35% and 48%, respectively, of all unreinsured U.S. GMWB contracts were in the money . For those contracts that were in the money , the average contract was 9% and 13% in the money as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For U.S. GMWB contracts that were in the money , the Company net amount at risk (i.e. GRB less account value), after reinsurance, as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, was $1.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. For U.K. and Japan GMWB contracts that were in the money , the Company net amount at risk, after reinsurance, as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, was $73 and $125, respectively. However, the Company expects to incur these payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in the money GMWB at their death or their account value is reduced to a specified level, through contractually permitted withdrawals and/or market declines. If the account value is reduced to the specified level, the contract holder will receive an annuity equal to the remaining GRB. For the Company life-time GMWB products, this annuity can continue beyond the GRB. As the account value fluctuates with equity market returns on a daily basis and the life-time GMWB payments can exceed the GRB, the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than the Company current carried liability. For additional information on the Company GMWB liability, see Note 4a of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 103 Table of Contents GMDB The majority of the Company U.S. variable annuity contracts include a GMDB rider. Declines in the equity markets will increase the Company liability for GMDB riders. The Company total gross exposure (i.e., before reinsurance) to U.S. GMDB as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 is $10.7 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively. However, the Company will incur these payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in the money GMDB at their death. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, 70% and 82%, respectively, of all unreinsured U.S. GMDB contracts were in the money . For those contracts that were in the money , the average contract was 12% and 18% in the money as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company reinsured 60% and 53% of these death benefit guarantees as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Under certain of these reinsurance agreements, the reinsurers exposure is subject to an annual cap. The Company net exposure (i.e., after reinsurance), is $4.3 billion and $8.5 billion, as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company suspended all new product sales in Japan. Prior to that, the Company offered variable annuity products in Japan with a GMDB. For the in-force block of Japan business, declines in equity markets, as well as a strengthening of the Japanese yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar, the euro and other currencies will increase the Company liability for GMDB riders. This increase may be significant in extreme market scenarios. In general, the GMDB riders entitle the policyholder to receive the original investment value at the date of death. If the original investment value exceeds the account value upon death then the contract is in the money . As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, substantially all of the unreinsured Japan GMDB contracts were in the money . For those contracts that were in the money , the average contract was 22% and 18% in the money as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company total gross exposure (i.e., before reinsurance) to the GMDB offered in Japan is $8.8 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The Company reinsured 14% and 17% of the GMDB to a third-party reinsurer as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Under certain of these reinsurance agreements, the reinsurers exposure is subject to an annual cap. The Company net GMDB exposure (i.e. after reinsurance) is $7.6 billion and $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Many policyholders with a GMDB also have a GMWB in the US or GMIB in Japan. Policyholders that have a product that offer both guarantees can only receive the GMDB or the GMIB benefit in Japan or the GMDB or GMWB in the U.S. For additional information on the Company GMDB liability, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. GMIB In the second quarter of 2009, the Company suspended all new product sales in Japan. Prior to that, the Company offered variable annuity products in Japan with a GMIB. For GMIB contracts, in general, the policyholder has the right to elect to annuitize benefits, beginning (for certain products) on the tenth or fifteenth anniversary year of contract commencement, receive lump sum payment of account value, or remain in the variable sub-account. For GMIB contracts, the policyholder is entitled to receive the original investment value over a 10- to 15- year annuitization period. A small percentage of the contracts will first become eligible to elect annuitization beginning in 2013. The remainder of the contracts will first become eligible to elect annuitization from 2014 to 2022. Because policyholders have various contractual rights to defer their annuitization election, the period over which annuitization election can take place is subject to policyholder behavior and therefore indeterminate. In addition, upon annuitization the contractholder surrenders access to the account value and the account value is transferred to the Company general account where it is invested and the additional investment proceeds are used towards payment of the original investment value. If the original investment value exceeds the account value upon annuitization then the contract is in the money . As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, substantially all of the Japan GMIB contracts were in the money . For those contracts that were in the money , the average contract was 17% and 12% in the money as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, 54% of retained net amount at risk is reinsured to an affiliate of The Hartford. For additional information on the Company GMIB liability, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table represents the timing of account values eligible for annuitization under the Japan GMIB as of December 31, 2010, as well as the retained net amount at risk. The account values reflect 100% annuitization at the earliest point allowed by the contract and no adjustments for future market returns and policyholder behaviors. Future market returns, changes in the value of the Japanese yen and policyholder behaviors will impact account values eligible for annuitization in the years presented.

Variable Annuity Guarantee [1] U.S. GAAP Treatment [1] Primary Market Risk Exposures [1] U.S Variable Guarantees GMDB Accumulation of the portion of fees required to cover expected claims, less accumulation of actual claims paid Equity Market Levels GMWB Fair Value Equity Market Levels / Implied Volatility / Interest Rates For Life Component of GMWB Accumulation of the portion of fees required to cover expected claims, less accumulation of actual claims paid Equity Market Levels International Variable Guarantees GMDB & GMIB Accumulation of the portion of fees required to cover expected claims, less accumulation of actual claims paid Equity Market Levels / Interest Rates / Foreign Currency GMWB Fair Value Equity Market Levels / Implied Volatility / Interest Rates /Foreign Currency GMAB Fair Value Equity Market Levels / Implied Volatility / Interest Rates /Foreign Currency [1] Each of these guarantees and the related U.S. GAAP accounting volatility will also be influenced by actual and estimated policyholder behavior. Risk Management The Company carefully analyzes GMDB, GMWB, GMIB, and GMAB market risk exposures arising from equity markets, interest rates, implied volatility, foreign currency exchange risk, and correlation between these market risk exposures. The Company evaluates these risks both individually and in the aggregate, to determine the financial risk of its products and to judge their potential impacts on U.S. GAAP earnings, statutory surplus, and ultimately cash flow liability. The Company manages the equity market, interest rate, implied volatility and foreign currency exchange risks embedded in its products through reinsurance, customized derivatives, and dynamic hedging and macro hedging programs. In addition, the Company recently launched a new variable annuity product with reduced equity risk and has increased GMWB rider fees on new sales of the Company legacy variable annuities and the related in-force policies, as contractually permitted. Depending upon competitors reactions with respect to products and related rider charges, the Company strategy of reducing product risk and increasing fees has and may continue to result in a decline in market share. The following table depicts the type of risk management strategy being used by the Company to either partially or fully mitigate market risk exposures, displayed above, by variable annuity guarantee as of December 31, 2010: Variable Annuity Guarantee Reinsurance Customized Derivative Dynamic Hedging [1] Macro Hedging [2] GMDB GMWB For Life Component of GMWB GMIB GMAB [1] Through the year ended 2010, the Company continued to maintain a reduced level of dynamic hedge protection on GMWB while placing a greater relative emphasis on the protection of statutory surplus through the inclusion of a macro hedging program. This portion of the GMWB hedge strategy may include derivatives with maturities of up to 10 years. U.S. GAAP fair value volatility will be driven by a reduced level of dynamic hedge protection and macro program positions. [2] As described below, the Company macro hedging program is not designed to provide protection against any one variable annuity guarantee program, but rather is a broad based hedge designed to provide protection against multiple guarantees and market risks, primarily focused on statutory liability and surplus volatility. 105 Table of Contents Reinsurance The Company uses reinsurance for a portion of contracts with GMWB riders issued prior to the third quarter of 2003 and GMWB risks associated with a block of business sold between the third quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2006. The Company also uses reinsurance for a majority of the GMDB issued in the U.S. and a portion of the GMDB issued in Japan. Derivative Hedging Strategies The Company maintains derivative hedging strategies for its product guarantee risk to meet multiple, and in some cases, competing risk management objectives, including providing protection against tail scenario market events, providing resources to pay product guarantee claims, and minimizing U.S. GAAP earnings volatility, statutory surplus volatility and other economic metrics. Customized Derivatives The Company holds customized derivative contracts to provide protection from certain capital market risks for the remaining term of specified blocks of non-reinsured GMWB riders. These customized derivative contracts are based on policyholder behavior assumptions specified at the inception of the derivative contracts. The Company retains the risk for differences between assumed and actual policyholder behavior and between the performance of the actively managed funds underlying the separate accounts and their respective indices. Dynamic Hedging The Company dynamic hedging program uses derivative instruments to provide protection against the risks associated with the GMWB variable annuity product guarantees including equity market declines, equity implied volatility, and declines in interest rates (See Market Risk on Statutory Capital below). The Company uses hedging instruments including: interest rate futures and swaps, variance swaps, S&P 500, NASDAQ and EAFE index put options and futures contracts. During the year, the Company added additional volatility protection. While the Company actively manages this dynamic hedging program, increased U.S. GAAP earnings volatility may result from factors including, but not limited to: policyholder behavior, capital markets, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, changes in hedging positions and the relative emphasis placed on various risk management objectives. 106 Table of Contents Macro Hedging The Company macro hedging program uses derivative instruments such as options, futures, swaps, and forwards on equities, interest rates, and currencies to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from U.S., U.K. and Japan GMWB, GMDB, GMIB and GMAB liabilities, on the Company statutory surplus and the associated target RBC ratios (see Capital Resources and Liquidity). These macro hedges cover some of the residual risks not otherwise covered by specific dynamic hedging programs. Management assesses this residual risk under various scenarios in designing and executing the macro hedge program. During the year, the Company increased its equity macro hedge coverage including currency protection. The macro hedge program will result in additional U.S. GAAP earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory reserve and capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in U.S. GAAP liabilities. Based on the construction of the Company derivative hedging program (both dynamic and macro hedge), which can change based on capital market conditions, and changes in the hedging program, underlying exposures and other factors, an independent change in the following capital market factors is likely to have the following impacts. These sensitivities do not capture the impact of elapsed time on liabilities or hedge assets. Each of the sensitivities set forth below is estimated individually under the indicated level of market movement and from the market levels at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010, and without consideration of any correlation among the key assumptions. In addition, there are other factors, including changes to the underlying hedging program, policyholder behavior and variation in underlying fund performance relative to the hedged index, which could materially impact the GMWB liability. As a result, these sensitivities do not necessarily reflect the financial impact from large shifts in the underlying indices or when multiple risk factors are impacted. Actual net changes in the value of the GMWB liability, the related dynamic hedging program derivative assets and the macro hedge program derivative assets may vary materially from those calculated using only the sensitivities disclosed below: Pre-Tax/DAC Gain (Loss) Net Impact Net Impact GMWB GMWB Liability and Liability and Dynamic Macro Dynamic Macro Hedge Hedge Total Net Hedge Hedge Total Net Program Program [5] Impact Program Program [5] Impact Expected for fourth quarter based on Expected for first quarter based on Capital Market Factor September 30, 2010 December 31, 2010 Equity markets increase / decrease 1% [1] [2] $ (0) / 0 $ (34) / 34 $ (34) / 34 $ (0) / 0 $ (26) / 26 $ (26) / 26 Volatility increases / decreases 1% [3] $ (41) / 41 $ 16 / (16 ) $ (25) / 25 $ (26) / 26 $ 15 / (15 ) $ (11) / 11 Interest rates increase / decrease 1 basis point [4] $ 2 / (2 ) $ (1) / 1 $ 1 / (1 ) $ 2 / (2 ) $ (2) / 2 $ 0 / 0 Yen strengthens / weakens 1% versus all other currencies [5] $ $ 44 / (44 ) $ 44 / (44 ) $ $ 57 / (57 ) $ 57 / (57 ) [1] Represents the aggregate net impact of a 1% increase or decrease in broadly traded global equity indices. [2] The decrease in equity sensitivity in the macro hedge program was primarily due to equity markets rallying during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the equity Futures macro hedge that was added in the third quarter of 2010 which was subsequently rebalanced and reduced in the fourth quarter 2010. [3] Represents the aggregate net impact of a 1% increase or decrease in blended implied volatility that is generally skewed towards longer durations for broadly traded global equity indices. The decrease in volatility sensitivity was primarily due to additional purchases of volatility coverage in our dynamic hedge program. [4] Represents the aggregate net impact of a 1 basis point parallel shift on the global LIBOR yield curve. The increase in interest rate sensitivity in the macro hedge program was primarily due to additional purchases of interest rate coverage during the quarter. [5] Represents the aggregate net impact, which includes other non-Macro FX hedges, of a 1% strengthening or weakening in the yen compared to all other currencies. Due to the structure of the macro hedging program, the increase in currency sensitivity was primarily due to the additional purchases of currency protection and a strengthened Yen during the quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred a net realized pre-tax loss of $349 on GMWB liabilities, net of reinsurance and the dynamic and macro hedging programs, driven primarily by increases in equity levels of approximately 13% and decreases in interest rates of approximately 60 basis points, partially offset by decreases in volatility of approximately 2%, a strengthened yen of approximately 12% against USD and 19% against Euro, favorable assumption updates, and underlying fund performance relative to the hedge indices. As a result of the rebalancing of the hedging programs throughout 2010, the full year hedging results are not indicative of the sensitivities outlined above. 107 Table of Contents Market Risk on Statutory Capital Statutory surplus amounts and risk-based capital ( RBC ) ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include: In general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of both our actual potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin for death and living benefit guarantees associated with U.S. variable annuity contracts can be materially negatively effected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. Other market factors that can impact statutory surplus, reserve levels and capital margin include differences in performance of variable subaccounts relative to indices and/or realized equity and interest rate volatilities. In addition, as equity market levels increase, generally surplus levels will increase. RBC ratios will also tend to increase when equity markets increase. However, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit guarantees and RBC requirements could increase with rising equity markets, resulting in lower RBC ratios. Non-market factors, which can also impact the amount and volatility of both our actual potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin, include actual and estimated policyholder behavior experience as it pertains to lapsation, partial withdrawals, and mortality. Similarly, for guaranteed benefits (GMDB, GMIB, and GMWB) reinsured from our international operations to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the amount and volatility of both our actual potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially affected by a variety of factors, both market and non-market. Market factors include declines in various equity market indices and interest rates, changes in value of the yen versus other global currencies, difference in the performance of variable subaccounts relative to indices, and increases in realized equity, interest rate, and currency volatilities. Non-market factors include actual and estimated policyholder behavior experience as it pertains to lapsation, withdrawals, mortality, and annuitization. Risk mitigation activities, such as hedging, may also result in material and sometimes counterintuitive impacts on statutory surplus and capital margin. Notably, as changes in these market and non-market factors occur, both our potential obligation and the related statutory reserves and/or required capital can increase or decrease at a greater than linear rate. As the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio decreases, due in part to credit spread widening, statutory surplus and RBC ratios may decrease. As the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting decreases, statutory surplus and RBC ratios may decrease. The life insurance subsidiaries exposure to foreign currency exchange risk exists with respect to non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for at their U.S. dollar equivalent values using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. As foreign currency exchange rates vary in comparison to the U.S. dollar, the remeasured value of those non-dollar denominated assets or liabilities will also vary, causing an increase or decrease to statutory surplus. Our statutory surplus is also impacted by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities in our fixed market value adjusted ( MVA ) annuities. Statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed MVA annuities are recorded at fair value. In determining the statutory reserve for the fixed MVA annuities, we are required to use current crediting rates in the U.S. and Japanese LIBOR in Japan. In many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the U.S. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. As a result, the change in statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. However, in periods of volatile credit markets, such as we have experienced, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. As actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in the current crediting rates in the U.S. or Japanese LIBOR in Japan, the calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. This has resulted and may continue to result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the product. With respect to our fixed annuity business, sustained low interest rates may result in a reduction in statutory surplus and an increase in National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) required capital. Most of these factors are outside of the Company control. The Company financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. The Company has reinsured approximately 17% of its risk associated with U.S. GMWB and 60% of its risk associated with the aggregate U.S. GMDB exposure. These reinsurance agreements serve to reduce the Company exposure to changes in the statutory reserves and the related capital and RBC ratios associated with changes in the capital markets. The Company also continues to explore other solutions for mitigating the capital market risk effect on surplus, such as internal and external reinsurance solutions, modifications to our hedging program, changes in product design, increasing pricing and expense management. 108 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options through one of four Company-approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, credit spread including issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; to manage liquidity; to control transaction costs; or to enter into replication transactions. Downgrades to the credit ratings of The Hartford insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives including those used to hedge benefit guarantees of variable annuities. In some cases, further downgrades may give derivative counterparties the unilateral contractual right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, further downgrades may result in counterparties becoming unwilling to engage in additional over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades. This will restrict the supply of derivative instruments commonly used to hedge variable annuity guarantees, particularly long-dated equity derivatives and interest rate swaps. Under these circumstances, The Hartford operating subsidiaries could conduct hedging activity using a combination of cash and exchange-traded instruments, in addition to using the available OTC derivatives. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company foreign currency exchange risk is related to non U.S. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity investments, the investment in and net income of the Japanese and U.K. operations, and non-U.S. dollar denominated liability contracts, including its GMDB, GMAB, GMWB and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese and U.K. variable annuities, and a yen denominated individual fixed annuity product. Also, foreign currency exchange rate risk is inherent when the Japan policyholders variable annuity sub-account investments are non-Japanese yen denominated securities while the related GMDB and GMIB guarantees are effectively yen-denominated. A portion of the Company foreign currency exposure is mitigated through the use of derivatives. Fixed Maturity Investments The risk associated with the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities relates to potential decreases in value and income resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, which are primarily denominated in euro, sterling, yen and Canadian dollars, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were approximately $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. In order to manage its currency exposures, the Company enters into foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge the variability in cash flows as fair value associated with certain foreign denominated fixed maturities. These foreign currency swap and forward agreements are structured to match the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated securities. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the derivatives used to hedge currency exchange risk related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities had a total notional amount of $431 and $480, respectively, and total fair value of $(6) and $(26), respectively. Based on the fair values of the Company non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, management estimates that a 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by a before-tax total of approximately $87 and $62, respectively. The estimated impact was based upon a 10% change in December 31 spot rates. The selection of the 10% unfavorable change was made only for illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. 109 Table of Contents Liabilities The Company Wealth Management operations issued non-U.S. dollar denominated funding agreement liability contracts. The Company hedges the foreign currency risk associated with these liability contracts with currency rate swaps. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to foreign denominated liability contracts had a total notional amount of $771 and $814, respectively, and a total fair value of $(17) and $(2), respectively. The yen based fixed annuity product was written by Hartford Life Insurance K.K. ( HLIKK ), a wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary of Hartford Life, Inc. ( HLI ), and subsequently reinsured to Hartford Life Insurance Company, a U.S. dollar based wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of HLI. During 2009, the Company has since suspended new sales of the Japan business. The underlying investment involves investing in U.S. securities markets, which offer favorable credit spreads. The yen denominated fixed annuity product ( yen fixed annuities ) is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets with invested assets denominated in dollars while policyholder liabilities are denominated in yen and converted to U.S. dollars based upon the December 31, yen to U.S. dollar spot rate. The difference between U.S. dollar denominated investments and yen denominated liabilities exposes the Company to currency risk. The Company manages this currency risk associated with the yen fixed annuities primarily with pay variable U.S. dollar and receive fixed yen currency swaps. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional value of the currency swaps was $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion and the fair value was $608 and $316, respectively. Although economically an effective hedge, a divergence between the yen denominated fixed annuity product liability and the currency swaps exists primarily due to the difference in the basis of accounting between the liability and the derivative instruments (i.e. historical cost versus fair value). The yen denominated fixed annuity product liabilities are recorded on a historical cost basis and are only adjusted for changes in foreign spot rates and accrued income. The currency swaps are recorded at fair value, incorporating changes in value due to changes in forward foreign exchange rates, interest rates and accrued income. A before-tax net gain of $27 and $47 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which includes the changes in value of the currency swaps, excluding net periodic coupon settlements, and the yen fixed annuity contract remeasurement, was recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. Prior to 2010, the Company had also issued guaranteed benefits (GMDB and GMIB) that were reinsured from HLIKK to the U.S. insurance subsidiaries. During 2010, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts that convert U.S. dollars to yen in order to hedge the foreign currency risk due to U.S. dollar denominated assets backing the yen denominated liabilities. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts that convert euros to yen in order to economically hedge the risk arising when the Japan policyholders variable annuity sub-accounts are invested in non-Japanese yen denominated securities while the related GMDB and GMIB guarantees are effectively yen-denominated. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency risk associated with Japanese variable annuity products had a total notional amount of $1.7 billion and $257, respectively, and a total fair value of $73 and $(8), respectively. 110 Table of Contents CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of The Hartford and its insurance operations and their ability to generate cash flows from each of their business segments, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs over the next twelve months. Liquidity Requirements and Sources of Capital The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (Holding Company) The liquidity requirements of the holding company of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ( HFSG Holding Company ) have been and will continue to be met by HFSG Holding Company fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2010, dividends from its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities. Expected liquidity requirements of the HFSG Holding Company for the next twelve months include interest on debt of approximately $500, common stockholder dividends, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, of approximately $158, and preferred stock dividends of approximately $42. In addition, in 2010 The Hartford entered into an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Insurance Department granted approval for the Connecticut domiciled insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes. Debt HFSG Holding Company debt maturities over the next twelve months include $400 aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes that mature in October 2011. On June 15, 2010, The Hartford repaid its $275, 7.9% senior notes at maturity with funds from its capital raise in the first quarter of 2010. On March 23, 2010, The Hartford issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of its senior notes. The issuance consisted of $300 of 4.0% senior notes due March 30, 2015, $500 of 5.5% senior notes due March 30, 2020 and $300 of 6.625% senior notes due March 30, 2040. The senior notes bear interest at their respective rate, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 30 and September 30 of each year, beginning September 30, 2010. The issuance was made pursuant to the Company shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-142044). The Hartford used approximately $425 of the net proceeds from the debt issuances to repurchase the Series E Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a part of its participation in the Capital Purchase Program, $275 to repay senior notes at maturity in 2010, and intends to use the remaining proceeds to repay senior notes at maturity in 2011. For further discussion on the repurchase of the Series E Preferred Stock see the Capital Purchase Program discussion below. For additional information regarding debt, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Preferred Stock Issuance On March 23, 2010, The Hartford issued 23 million depositary shares, each representing 1/40th interest in the Series F Preferred Stock, at a price of $25 per depositary share and received net proceeds of $556 under the program. The Hartford used the net proceeds from the preferred stock issuance to repurchase the Series E Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a part of its participation in the Capital Purchase Program. For further discussion on the repurchase of the Series E Preferred Stock see the Capital Purchase Program discussion below. Common Stock Issuance On March 23, 2010, The Hartford issued approximately 59.6 million shares of common stock at a price to the public of $27.75 per share and received net proceeds of $1.6 billion. The Hartford used the net proceeds from the common stock issuance to repurchase the Series E Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as a part of its participation in the Capital Purchase Program. For further discussion on the repurchase of the Series E Preferred Stock see the Capital Purchase Program discussion below. Preferred and Common Stock Dividends On February 2, 2011, The Hartford Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share payable on April 1, 2011 to common shareholders of record as of March 1, 2011. On February 24, 2011, The Hartford Board of Directors declared a dividend of $18.125 on each share of Series F preferred stock payable on April 1, 2011 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2011. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits While the Company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and further amended by the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, and Internal Revenue Code regulations mandate minimum contributions in certain circumstances. The Company made contributions to its pension plans of $201, $201, and $2 in 2010, 2009 and 2008. No contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Company 2010 required minimum funding contribution was immaterial. The Company presently anticipates contributing approximately $201 to its pension plans in 2011, based upon certain economic and business assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, equity market performance, changes in interest rates and the Company other capital requirements. The Company does not have a required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2011 and the funding requirements for all of the pension plans is expected to be immaterial. 111 Table of Contents Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries Dividends to the HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted. The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. Dividends paid to HFSG Holding Company by its insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on cash requirements of HLI and other factors. The Company property-casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.5 billion in dividends to HFSG Holding Company in 2011 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. The Company life insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $83 in dividends to HLI in 2011 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. The aggregate of these amounts, net of amounts required by HLI, is the maximum the insurance subsidiaries could pay to HFSG Holding Company in 2011. In 2010, HFSG Holding Company and HLI received no dividends from the life insurance subsidiaries, and HFSG Holding Company received $1.0 billion in dividends from its property-casualty insurance subsidiaries. Other Sources of Capital for the HFSG Holding Company The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the Ratings section below for further discussion), and shareholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of stock, debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. The issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense. Capital Purchase Program On March 31, 2010, the Company repurchased all 3.4 million shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury ) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.4 billion. The Hartford used approximately $425 of the net proceeds from the debt issuance, $1.6 billion from the common stock issuance, $556 from the preferred stock issuance together with available funds at the HFSG Holding Company to repurchase the Series E Preferred Stock. The Company recorded a $440 charge to retained earnings representing the acceleration of the accretion of the remaining discount on the preferred stock. On September 27, 2010, the Treasury sold its warrants to purchase approximately 52 million shares of The Hartford common stock in a secondary public offering for net proceeds of approximately $706. The Hartford did not receive any proceeds from this sale. The warrants are exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time until June 26, 2019 at an initial exercise price of $9.79. The exercise price will be paid by the withholding by The Hartford of a number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants equal to the value of the aggregate exercise price of the warrants so exercised determined by reference to the closing price of The Hartford common stock on the trading day on which the warrants are exercised and notice is delivered to the warrant agent. The Hartford did not purchase any of the warrants sold by the Treasury. During the Company participation in the Capital Purchase Program ( CPP ), the Company was subject to numerous additional regulations, including restrictions on the ability to increase the common stock dividend, limitations on the compensation arrangements for senior executives and additional corporate governance standards. As a result of the redemption of Series E Preferred Stock, the Company is no longer subject to these regulations other than certain reporting and certification obligations to U.S. regulatory agencies. To satisfy a key eligibility requirement for participation in the CPP, The Hartford acquired Federal Trust Corporation and has agreed with the OTS to serve as a source of strength to its wholly-owned subsidiary Federal Trust Bank ( FTB ), which included capital contributions of $5 and $195 in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and could require further contributions of capital to FTB in the future. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, FTB Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.4% and 8.3%, respectively. FTB was designated as a well capitalized institution at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Shelf Registrations On August 4, 2010, The Hartford filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-168532) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. In that The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of the shelf. 112 Table of Contents Contingent Capital Facility On February 12, 2007, The Hartford entered into a put option agreement (the Put Option Agreement ) with Glen Meadow ABC Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the ABC Trust ), and LaSalle Bank National Association, as put option calculation agent. The Put Option Agreement provides The Hartford with the right to require the ABC Trust, at any time and from time to time, to purchase The Hartford junior subordinated notes (the Notes ) in a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500. Under the Put Option Agreement, The Hartford will pay the ABC Trust premiums on a periodic basis, calculated with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes that The Hartford had the right to put to the ABC Trust for such period. The Hartford has agreed to reimburse the ABC Trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. The Company holds a variable interest in the ABC Trust where the Company is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Company did not consolidate the ABC Trust. As of December 31, 2010, The Hartford has not exercised its right to require ABC Trust to purchase the Notes. As a result, the Notes remain a source of capital for the HFSG Holding Company. Commercial Paper and Revolving Credit Facility The table below details the Company short-term debt programs and the applicable balances outstanding. Maximum Available As of Outstanding As of Effective Expiration December 31, December 31, Description Date Date 2010 2009 2010 2009 Commercial Paper The Hartford 11/10/86 N/A $ 2,000 $ 2,000 $ $ Revolving Credit Facility 5-year revolving credit facility 8/9/07 8/9/12 1,900 1,900 Total Commercial Paper and Revolving Credit Facility $ 3,900 $ 3,900 $ $ While The Hartford maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $2.0 billion, the Company is dependent upon market conditions to access short-term financing through the issuance of commercial paper to investors. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has no commercial paper outstanding. The revolving credit facility provides for up to $1.9 billion of unsecured credit through August 9, 2012. Of the total availability under the revolving credit facility, up to $100 is available to support letters of credit issued on behalf of The Hartford or other subsidiaries of The Hartford. Under the revolving credit facility, the Company must maintain a minimum level of consolidated net worth of $12.5 billion. At December 31, 2010, the consolidated net worth of the Company as calculated in accordance with the terms of the credit facility was $23 billion. The definition of consolidated net worth under the terms of the credit facility, excludes AOCI and includes the Company outstanding junior subordinated debentures and perpetual preferred securities, net of discount. In addition, the Company must not exceed a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization of 40%. At December 31, 2010, as calculated in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, the Company debt to capitalization ratio was 17%. Quarterly, the Company certifies compliance with the financial covenants for the syndicate of participating financial institutions. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The Hartford Japan operation also maintains lines of credit in support of the subsidiary operations. As of December 31, 2010 there was a line of credit in the amount of $62, or 5 billion, which expires January 4, 2012. On February 14, 2011 an additional line of credit was executed in the amount of $60, or 5 billion, which expires September 30, 2011. Derivative Commitments Certain of the Company derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement as set by nationally recognized statistical rating agencies. If the legal entity financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2010, is $557. Of this $557 the legal entities have posted collateral of $530 in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2010, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody or S&P could require approximately an additional $29 to be posted as collateral. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2010, a downgrade by either Moody or S&P of two levels below the legal entities current financial strength ratings could require approximately an additional $56 of assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the collateral that we may be required to post is primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Treasury notes. The table below presents the aggregate notional amount and fair value of derivative relationships that could be subject to immediate termination in the event of further rating agency downgrades. As of December 31, 2010 Ratings levels Notional Amount Fair Value Either BBB+ or Baa1 [1] $ 16,117 $ 307 [1] The notional and fair value amounts include a customized GMWB derivative with a notional amount of $5.1 billion and a fair value of $122, for which the Company has a contractual right to make a collateral payment in the amount of approximately $60 to prevent its termination. 113 Table of Contents Insurance Operations Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity or surrenders may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms and, therefore, the Company insurance operations current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months, including any obligations related to the Company restructuring activities. For a discussion and tabular presentation of the Company current contractual obligations by period, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations within the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A. The principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from assets under management and investment income, while investing cash flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting expenses, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the HFSG Holding Company. The Company insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as Property & Casualty Operations ) and life insurance products (collectively referred to as Life Operations ). Property & Casualty Property & Casualty Operations holds fixed maturity securities including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase) to meet liquidity needs. The following table summarizes Property & Casualty Operation fixed maturities, short-term investments, and cash, as of December 31, 2010: Fixed maturities [1] $ 25,124 Short-term investments 1,117 Cash 250 Less: Derivative collateral (174 ) Total $ 26,317 [1] Includes $1.4 billion of U.S. Treasuries. Liquidity requirements that are unable to be funded by Property & Casualty Operation short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating funds, including premiums received or through the sale of invested assets. A sale of invested assets could result in significant realized losses. Life Operations Life Operation total general account contractholder obligations are supported by $70 billion, of cash and total general account invested assets, excluding equity securities, trading, which includes a significant short-term investment position, as depicted below, to meet liquidity needs. The following table summarizes Life Operation fixed maturities, short-term investments, and cash, as of December 31, 2010: Fixed maturities [1] $ 53,068 Short-term investments 5,631 Cash 1,809 Less: Derivative collateral (1,725 ) Cash associated with Japan variable annuities (702 ) Total $ 58,081 [1] Includes $3.4 billion of U.S. Treasuries. Capital resources available to fund liquidity, upon contract holder surrender, are a function of the legal entity in which the liquidity requirement resides. Generally, obligations of Group Benefits will be funded by Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company; Global Annuity and Life Insurance obligations will be generally funded by both Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company; obligations of Retirement Plans and institutional investment products will be generally funded by Hartford Life Insurance Company; and obligations of the Company international annuity subsidiaries will be generally funded by the legal entity in the country in which the obligation was generated. 114 Table of Contents As of December 31, Contractholder Obligations 2010 Total Life contractholder obligations $ 256,040 Less: Separate account assets [1] (159,742 ) International statutory separate accounts [1] (32,793 ) General account contractholder obligations $ 63,505 Composition of General Account Contractholder Obligations Contracts without a surrender provision and/or fixed payout dates [2] $ 29,303 Fixed MVA annuities [3] 10,467 International fixed MVA annuities 2,723 Guaranteed investment contracts ( GIC ) [4] 912 Other [5] 20,100 General account contractholder obligations $ 63,505 [1] In the event customers elect to surrender separate account assets or international statutory separate accounts, Life Operations will use the proceeds from the sale of the assets to fund the surrender, and Life Operation liquidity position will not be impacted. In many instances Life Operations will receive a percentage of the surrender amount as compensation for early surrender (surrender charge), increasing Life Operation liquidity position. In addition, a surrender of variable annuity separate account or general account assets (see below) will decrease Life Operation obligation for payments on guaranteed living and death benefits. [2] Relates to contracts such as payout annuities or institutional notes, other than guaranteed investment products with an MVA feature (discussed below) or surrenders of term life, group benefit contracts or death and living benefit reserves for which surrenders will have no current effect on Life Operation liquidity requirements. [3] Relates to annuities that are held in a statutory separate account, but under U.S. GAAP are recorded in the general account as Fixed MVA annuity contract holders are subject to the Company credit risk. In the statutory separate account, Life Operation is required to maintain invested assets with a fair value equal to the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract. In the event assets decline in value at a greater rate than the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, Life Operation is required to contribute additional capital to the statutory separate account. Life Operation will fund these required contributions with operating cash flows or short-term investments. In the event that operating cash flows or short-term investments are not sufficient to fund required contributions, the Company may have to sell other invested assets at a loss, potentially resulting in a decrease in statutory surplus. As the fair value of invested assets in the statutory separate account are generally equal to the MVA surrender value of the Fixed MVA contract, surrender of Fixed MVA annuities will have an insignificant impact on the liquidity requirements of Life Operation. [4] GICs are subject to discontinuance provisions which allow the policyholders to terminate their contracts prior to scheduled maturity at the lesser of the book value or market value. Generally, the market value adjustment reflects changes in interest rates and credit spreads. As a result, the market value adjustment feature in the GIC serves to protect the Company from interest rate risks and limit Life Operation liquidity requirements in the event of a surrender. [5] Surrenders of, or policy loans taken from, as applicable, these general account liabilities, which include the general account option for Global Annuity individual variable annuities and Life Insurance variable life contracts, the general account option for Retirement Plans annuities and universal life contracts sold by Life Insurance may be funded through operating cash flows of Life Operations, available short-term investments, or Life Operations may be required to sell fixed maturity investments to fund the surrender payment. Sales of fixed maturity investments could result in the recognition of significant realized losses and insufficient proceeds to fully fund the surrender amount. In this circumstance, Life Operations may need to take other actions, including enforcing certain contract provisions which could restrict surrenders and/or slow or defer payouts. Consolidated Liquidity Position The following table summarizes the liquidity available to The Hartford: As of December 31, Liquidity available to The Hartford 2010 Short-term investments $ 8,528 U.S. Treasuries 5,029 Cash 2,062 Less: Derivative collateral (1,899 ) Cash associated with Japan variable annuities (702 ) Total liquidity available $ 13,018 115 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company, except for the contingent capital facility described above and the following: The Company has unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships, private placements and mortgage loans of approximately $1.5 billion as disclosed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table identifies the Company aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments due by period Less than 1-3 3-5 More than Total 1 year years years 5 years Property and casualty obligations [1] $ 21,549 $ 5,732 $ 4,471 $ 2,857 $ 8,489 Life, annuity and disability obligations [2] 386,382 26,697 56,139 51,192 252,354 Operating lease obligations [3] 307 114 118 42 33 Long-term debt obligations [4] 19,799 901 1,280 1,610 16,008 Consumer notes [5] 419 79 250 50 40 Purchase obligations [6] 2,338 1,972 209 114 43 Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet [7] 1,848 1,357 345 146 Total [8] $ 432,642 $ 36,852 $ 62,812 $ 56,011 $ 276,967 [1] The following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations under property and casualty contracts: Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include IBNR and case reserves. While payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the Company, the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and IBNR is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future. In estimating the timing of future payments by year, the Company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue. However, the actual timing of future payments could vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims. Also, estimated payments in 2010 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2010 on policies that were in force as of December 31, 2009. In addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that may be used, in part, to fund loss payments. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is only permitted to discount reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. For the Company, these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants. As of December 31, 2010, the total property and casualty reserves in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $524. [2] Estimated life, annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims, policy surrenders, policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts. Estimated life, annuity and disability obligations are based on mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with Life historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. Life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with other assumptions. In contrast to this table, the majority of Life obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting, or future deposits. Therefore, the estimated obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results. [3] Includes future minimum lease payments on operating lease agreements. See Notes 12 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on lease commitments. [4] Includes contractual principal and interest payments. All long-term debt obligations have fixed rates of interest. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations. [5] Consumer notes include principal payments and contractual interest for fixed rate notes and interest based on current rates for floating rate notes. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of consumer notes. [6] Includes $1.5 billion in commitments to purchase investments including about $693 of limited partnership, $99 of private placements and $729 of mortgage loans. Outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be reliably estimated. The remaining commitments to purchase investments primarily represent payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the Company consolidated balance sheet. In January 2011 the Company executed an extension of its existing information technology outsourcing arrangement with a third party vendor. This extension is effective February 1, 2011 and runs through January 31, 2016. The approximate annual cost/outlay is $96 per year and is not included in the table above. Also included in purchase obligations is $642 relating to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, information technology, and transportation in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased. [7] Includes cash collateral of $1.1 billion which the Company has accepted in connection with the Company derivative instruments. Since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year. Includes deposits and bank advances that were acquired through the purchase of Federal Trust Corporation in the second quarter of 2009. Also included in other long term liabilities is $48 of net unrecognized tax benefits. [8] Does not include estimated voluntary contribution of $200 to the Company pension plan in 2011. 116 Table of Contents Capitalization The capital structure of The Hartford as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consisted of debt and stockholders equity, summarized as follows: December 31, December 31, 2010 2009 Change Short-term debt (includes current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations) $ 400 $ 343 17 % Long-term debt 6,207 5,496 13 % Total debt [1] 6,607 5,839 13 % Stockholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax ( AOCI ) 21,312 21,177 1 % AOCI, net of tax (1,001 ) (3,312 ) 70 % Total stockholders equity $ 20,311 $ 17,865 14 % Total capitalization including AOCI $ 26,918 $ 23,704 14 % Debt to stockholders equity 33 % 33 % Debt to capitalization 25 % 25 % [1] Total debt of the Company excludes $382 and $1.1 billion of consumer notes as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, and $25 and $78 of Federal Home Loan Bank advances recorded in other liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The Hartford total capitalization increased $3.2 billion, or 14%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 due to increases in debt, improvements in AOCI and increases in stockholders equity, excluding AOCI. Total debt increased primarily due to the issuance of $1.1 billion in senior notes in March 2010 partially offset by the repayment of $275 in senior notes in June 2010 and payment of capital lease obligations in January 2010. AOCI, net of tax, improved primarily due to increases in net unrealized available-for-sale securities of $2.0 billion primarily as a result of improved security valuations due to declining interest rates and an increase of $128 in cash flow hedging instruments. The increase in stockholders equity, excluding AOCI, was primarily due to net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion, issuance of common shares under public offering of $1.6 billion, and issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock of $556, partially offset by the redemption of $3.4 billion in preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the redemption of the preferred stock and issuances of stock in 2010. For additional information on stockholders equity, AOCI, net of tax, pension and other postretirement plans and Allianz investment in The Hartford see Notes 15, 16, 17 and 21, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flow 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,309 $ 2,974 $ 4,192 Net cash used for investing activities $ (434 ) $ (3,123 ) $ (8,827 ) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ (2,955 ) $ 523 $ 4,274 Cash end of year $ 2,062 $ 2,142 $ 1,811 Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 The increase in cash provided by operating activities, compared to the prior year period, was primarily the result of increases in fee income. Cash used for investing activities in 2010 primarily relates to net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.5 billion and net payments on derivatives of $338, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of mortgage loans of $1.4 billion. Cash used for investing activities in 2009 consisted of net outflows of $2.9 billion from changes in payables on securities lending, net purchases of available-for-sale securities and $561 of net payments on derivatives, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of mortgage loans of $396. Cash provided by (used for) financing activities decreased primarily due to the redemption of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury of $3.4 billion, repayments of consumer notes of $754 in 2010, repayment of $275 in senior notes in June 2010 and net outflows on investment and universal life-type contracts in 2010. Partially offsetting the decreases were proceeds from the issuance of $1.1 billion in aggregate senior notes, issuance of common stock under a public offering of $1.6 billion and issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock of $556. Year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of lower premiums, lower fee income and lower net investment income. Net derivative settlements and pay down of collateral under securities lending account for the majority of cash used for investing activities. Cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to net flows decrease in investment and universal life-type contracts of $5.5 billion partially offset by issuances of preferred stock and warrants to the U.S. Treasury for $3.4 billion and issuance of common stock through a discretionary equity issuance plan of $887 in 2009 and treasury stock acquired in 2008, partially offset by issuance of long-term debt and consumer notes in 2008 and repayments of commercial paper in 2009. Operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements. 117 Table of Contents Equity Markets For a discussion of the potential impact of the equity markets on capital and liquidity, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section under Market Risk . Ratings Ratings impact the Company cost of borrowing and its ability to access financing and are an important factor in establishing competitive position in the insurance and financial services marketplace. There can be no assurance that the Company ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company ratings are downgraded, the Company cost of borrowing and ability to access financing, as well as the level of revenues or the persistency of its business may be adversely impacted. The following table summarizes The Hartford significant member companies financial ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of February 18, 2011. Insurance Financial Strength Ratings: A.M. Best Fitch Standard & Poor Moody Hartford Fire Insurance Company A A+ A A2 Hartford Life Insurance Company A A- A A3 Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company A A- A A3 Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company A A- A A3 Other Ratings: The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.: Senior debt bbb+ BBB- BBB Baa3 Commercial paper AMB-2 F2 A-2 P-3 These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of The Hartford securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. The agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. One consideration is the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business written. Statutory surplus represents the capital of the insurance company reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department. Statutory Surplus The table below sets forth statutory surplus for the Company insurance companies. The statutory surplus amount as of December 31, 2009 in the table below is based on actual statutory filings with the applicable U.S. regulatory authorities. The statutory surplus amount as of December 31, 2010 is an estimate, as the respective 2010 statutory filings have not yet been made. 2010 2009 U.S. life insurance subsidiaries, includes domestic captive insurance subsidiaries $ 7,731 $ 7,324 Property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 7,721 7,364 Total $ 15,452 $ 14,688 Total statutory capital and surplus increased by $764 primarily due statutory net income, after tax, for property and casualty subsidiaries of $1.5 billion, offset by statutory net losses of $140 in our life insurance subsidiaries, including domestic captive insurance subsidiaries and dividends to the HFSG Holding Company of $1.0 billion. The Company also holds regulatory capital and surplus for its operations in Japan. Using the investment in subsidiary accounting requirements defined in the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners Statements of Statutory Accounting Practices, the Company statutory capital and surplus attributed to the Japan operations was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. However, under the accounting practices and procedures governed by Japanese regulatory authorities, the Company statutory capital and surplus was $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 118 Table of Contents Statutory Capital The Company stockholders equity, as prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) was $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2010. The Company estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus, as prepared in accordance with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual ( US STAT ) was $15.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. Significant differences between US GAAP stockholders equity and aggregate statutory capital and surplus prepared in accordance with US STAT include the following: Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under US GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under US STAT. Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under US GAAP while those amounts deferred are subject to limitations under US STAT. The assumptions used in the determination of Life benefit reserves is prescribed under US STAT, while the assumptions used under US GAAP are generally the Company best estimates. The methodologies for determining life insurance reserve amounts may also be different. For example, reserving for living benefit reserves under US STAT is generally addressed by the Commissioners Annuity Reserving Valuation Methodology and the related Actuarial Guidelines, while under US GAAP, those same living benefits may be considered embedded derivatives and recorded at fair value or they may be considered SOP 03-1 reserves. The sensitivity of these life insurance reserves to changes in equity markets, as applicable, will be different between US GAAP and US STAT. The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under US GAAP, while US STAT only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. US STAT for life insurance companies establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the Asset Valuation Reserve), while US GAAP does not. Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, US STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while US GAAP does not. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for US GAAP, while under US STAT goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill is limited. In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under US STAT. US GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability. Risk-Based Capital State insurance regulators and the NAIC have adopted risk-based capital requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Under risk-based capital ( RBC ) requirements, a company RBC is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. The adequacy of a company actual capital is determined by the ratio of a company total adjusted capital, as defined by the insurance regulators, to its company action level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by insurance regulators. RBC standards are used by regulators to set in motion appropriate regulatory actions related to insurers that show indications of inadequate conditions. In addition, rating agencies consider RBC ratios, along with their proprietary models, in making ratings determinations. Sensitivity In any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory surplus or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on the factors see the Market Risk on Statutory Capital section within Capital Markets Risk Management of the MD&A. Statutory capital at the Property & Casualty subsidiaries has historically been maintained at or above the capital level required to meet AA level ratings from rating agencies. Statutory capital generated by the Property & Casualty subsidiaries in excess of the capital level required to meet AA level ratings is available for use by the enterprise or for corporate purposes. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting Property & Casualty results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments. In addition, the Company can access the $500 Glen Meadow trust contingent capital facility and maintains the ability to access $1.9 billion of capacity under its revolving credit facility. 119 Table of Contents Contingencies Legal Proceedings For a discussion regarding contingencies related to The Hartford legal proceedings, please see the information contained under Litigation and Asbestos and Environmental Claims, in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the United States Treasury Department could have a material effect on the insurance business. These proposals and initiatives include, or could include, new taxes or assessments on large financial institutions, changes pertaining to the income tax treatment of insurance companies and life insurance products and annuities, repeal or reform of the estate tax and comprehensive federal tax reform, and changes to the regulatory structure for financial institutions. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. Legislative Developments Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted on July 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act may affect our operations and governance in ways that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act vests a newly created Financial Services Oversight Council with the power to designate systemically important institutions, which will be subject to special regulatory supervision and other provisions intended to prevent, or mitigate the impact of, future disruptions in the U.S. financial system. Systemically important institutions are limited to nonbank financial companies that are so important that their potential failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. If we are designated as a systemically important institution, we could be subject to higher capital requirements and additional regulatory oversight imposed by The Federal Reserve, as well as to post-event assessments imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) to recoup the costs associated with the orderly resolution of other systemically important institutions in the event one or more such institutions fails. Further, the FDIC is authorized to petition a state court to commence an insolvency proceeding to liquidate an insurance company that fails in the event the insurer state regulator fails to act. Other provisions will require central clearing of, and/or impose new margin and capital requirements on, derivatives transactions, which we expect will increase the costs of our hedging program. A number of provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act affect us solely due to our status as a savings & loan holding company. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the OTS will be dissolved. The Federal Reserve will regulate us as a holding company, and the OCC will regulate our thrift subsidiary, Federal Trust Bank. Because of our status as a savings and loan holding company or if we are designated a systemically important institution, the Dodd-Frank Act may also restrict us from sponsoring and investing in private equity and hedge funds, which would limit our discretion in managing our general account. The Dodd-Frank Act will also impose new minimum capital standards on a consolidated basis for holding companies that, like us, control insured depository institutions. Other provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact us, irrespective of whether or not we are a savings and loan holding company include: the possibility that regulators could break up firms that are considered too big to fail; a new Federal Insurance Office within Treasury to, among other things, conduct a study of how to improve insurance regulation in the United States; new means for regulators to limit the activities of financial firms; discretionary authority for the SEC to impose a harmonized standard of care for investment advisers and broker-dealers who provide personalized advice about securities to retail customers; additional regulation of compensation in the financial services industry; and enhancements to corporate governance, especially regarding risk management. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. FY 2012, Budget of the United States Government On February 15, 2011, the Obama Administration released its FY 2012, Budget of the United States Government (the Budget ). Although the Administration has not released proposed statutory language, the Budget includes proposals which if enacted, would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products. In particular, the proposals would affect the treatment of corporate owned life insurance ( COLI ) policies by limiting the availability of certain interest deductions for companies that purchase those policies. The proposals would also change the method used to determine the amount of dividend income received by a life insurance company on assets held in separate accounts used to support products, including variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts, that are eligible for the dividends received deduction ( DRD ). The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between the Company actual tax expense and expected amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company sale of COLI, variable annuities, and variable life products could be adversely affected and the Company actual tax expense could increase, reducing earnings. The Budget also included a proposal to levy a $30 billion Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, in the aggregate, on large financial institutions, including The Hartford.
