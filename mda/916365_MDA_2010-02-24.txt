Item 7 . Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com . Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: Equine, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; Hardware and seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment; Truck, towing and tool products; Work/recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family; Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and Home d cor, candy, snack food and toys. Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 square feet to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space. We use a standard 15,500 square foot prototype for new purpose-built locations. For new existing buildings, one of several layout formats is utilized. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del s, which operated 27 stores as of December 26, 2009 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Hawaii, offers a wide selection of products (primarily in the equine, pet and animal category) tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth. We have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13.0%. We project an increase of 70 to 80 new stores in 2010, an increase of approximately 8%. We opened 76 new stores in 2009 and 91 new stores in 2008, an increase of approximately 9% and 12%, respectively. We operated 930 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 26, 2009 and have plans to open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2010. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 850 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores (excluding Del s) in the United States. The acquisition of Del enabled us to establish an initial presence in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in Washington, along with three stores in Hawaii. We have slowed the growth of Del as we refine the concept, and we do not plan to open any additional Del stores in fiscal 2010. The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2009 was $1.3 million for retrofit stores and $1.0 million for prototype stores. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $102,000 for pre-opening costs. We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance. 16 Table of Contents Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season. Purchase Price Volatility Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin. Additionally, significant inflationary pressures could have an adverse affect on our last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory provision, which would negatively impact gross margin. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality. Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. 17 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns: We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete. Revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized when: (i) the gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer; (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ); or (iii) the unredeemed merchandise returns cards expire (one year from issuance). We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one-year rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales. Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts. The gift card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for unredeemed gift cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize sales returns in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate sales returns or gift card breakage. However, if actual consumer return or gift card redemption patterns are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 50 basis point change in our sales return rate at December 26, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $170,000 in fiscal 2009. A 50 basis point change in our gift card breakage rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $250,000 in fiscal 2009. Inventory Valuation: Impairment Risk We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand, and the promotional environment. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize impairment reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 26, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $545,000 in fiscal 2009. 18 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Shrinkage We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends and the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve. However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 26, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $835,000 in fiscal 2009. Vendor Support We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs. The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years. Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor product. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold. During the interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility. At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known. Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2009. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 26, 2009, net earnings would have been affected by approximately $1.1 million. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales. Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories. This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net earnings would have been affected by approximately $2.9 million. 19 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Share-Based Compensation: We have share-based compensation plans, which includes incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Share-Based Compensation, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our share-based compensation programs. We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We estimate the fair value of our market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant utilizing average market price of our stock on the date of the related award. Option-pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. In addition to the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value, the estimated forfeiture rate of the awarded options is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. While we update our assumptions annually, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material. The reported share-based compensation expense may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share-based compensation. A 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 26, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $765,000. Self-Insurance Reserves: We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 26, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $1.5 million in fiscal 2009. 20 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Sales Tax Audit Reserve: A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the regulatory support for the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the sales tax audit reserve in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve for current audits. However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax liability reserve at December 26, 2009, would have affected net earnings by approximately $330,000 in fiscal 2009. Tax Contingencies: Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 26, 2009 would have affected net earnings by approximately $290,000 in fiscal 2009. 21 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Goodwill: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. All goodwill at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 is associated with the Del business and for purposes of impairment testing, Del is considered the reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. We determined that the fair value of the Del reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary. In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the Del reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, the fair value of the Del reporting unit is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses and guideline transactions. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. Estimates include revenues, gross margins, operating costs and cash flows. We considered historical and estimated future results, economic and market conditions and the impact of planned business and operational strategies in deriving these estimates. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. In developing the key judgments and assumptions used to assess impairment, we consider economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the Del reporting unit. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based may differ in some respects from actual results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions persist, then key judgments and assumptions may be impacted. At December 26, 2009, the fair value of the Del reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately $100,000. Thus, if actual results are not consistent with our current estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. 22 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ From Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset carrying value exceeds the asset estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 23 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2009 and 2008 are shown below (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total 2009 Net sales $ 650,171 $ 946,504 $ 747,730 $ 862,532 $ 3,206,937 Gross margin 201,036 302,198 246,038 285,685 1,034,957 Operating income 1,185 88,294 35,797 59,357 184,633 Net income 470 54,764 21,979 38,253 115,466 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.01 $ 1.53 $ 0.61 $ 1.06 $ 3.21 Diluted $ 0.01 $ 1.50 $ 0.60 $ 1.04 $ 3.15 Same-store sales increase (decrease) 4.2 % (2.7 %) (5.1 %) 0.7 % (1.1 %) 2008 Net sales $ 576,208 $ 898,327 $ 733,918 $ 799,496 $ 3,007,949 Gross margin 175,516 273,509 218,196 245,040 912,261 Operating income (loss) (2,041 ) 71,158 26,077 40,375 135,569 Net income (loss) (2,004 ) 43,352 15,870 24,712 81,930 Net income (loss) per share: (1) Basic $ (0.05 ) $ 1.17 $ 0.44 $ 0.68 $ 2.22 Diluted $ (0.05 ) $ 1.15 $ 0.43 $ 0.67 $ 2.19 Same-store sales increase (decrease) (6.5 %) 3.4 % 6.2 % 1.3 % 1.4 % (1) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 contain 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold (a) 67.7 69.7 68.5 Gross margin (a) 32.3 30.3 31.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses (a) 24.4 23.8 23.7 Depreciation and amortization 2.1 2.0 1.9 Operating income 5.8 4.5 5.9 Interest expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.2 Income before income taxes 5.7 4.4 5.7 Income tax provision 2.1 1.7 2.1 Net income 3.6 % 2.7 % 3.6 % (a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net sales increased 6.6% to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009 from $3.01 billion in fiscal 2008. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in same-store sales. The same-store average daily transaction count increased 5.3%, while same-store transaction value decreased 6.0% for fiscal 2009. Same-store sales decreased 1.1% compared with a same-store sales increase of 1.4% in the prior year. This same-store sales decline was primarily driven by softness in sales of seasonal big ticket (merchandise priced $350 or greater) and discretionary merchandise, partially offset by continued strong results in core consumable categories, including animal and pet-related products. In fiscal 2009, we opened 76 new stores (compared to 91 new stores in fiscal 2008), relocated two stores (compared to one in fiscal 2008) and closed one store (compared to no stores in fiscal 2008). Gross margin increased 13.4% to $1,035.0 million compared to $912.3 million in 2008. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 32.3% for fiscal 2009 compared to 30.3% for fiscal 2008. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a substantial decrease in the LIFO provision and lower transportation costs. The LIFO charge decreased by $35.9 million to $6.9 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $42.8 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease is due to an overall decline in the rate of inflation and cost reductions in certain product categories. Even as inflation moderates and inventory per store declines, we continue to generate a LIFO charge as we add merchandise that has higher inflation indices than the existing Company average. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 60 basis points to 24.4% in fiscal 2009 from 23.8% in fiscal 2008. This increase as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the deleveraging related to the same-store sales decrease and higher incentive compensation and occupancy costs, partially offset by reduced marketing costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 due mainly to costs associated with new stores. 25 Table of Contents Net interest expense decreased 22.9% to $1.6 million in fiscal 2009 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2008; however, net interest expense remained consistent as a percent of sales. This decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher interest charges associated with sales tax audits. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2008. This reduction in the tax resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits and a lower percentage of unfavorable permanent tax differences relative to income before taxes. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2009 increased 40.9% to $115.5 million, or $3.15 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $81.9 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. During 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $15.3 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program. In 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $53.9 million. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Net sales increased 11.3% to $3,007.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $2,703.2 million in fiscal 2007. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 1.4%. The same-store average daily transaction count increased 0.1%, while same-store transaction value increased 1.3% for fiscal 2008. Same-store sales improvements of 1.4% compared to 3.4% in the prior year were strongest in core consumable categories including animal and pet-related products, clothing and footwear. In fiscal 2008, we opened 91 new stores (compared to 89 new stores in fiscal 2007), relocated one store (compared to 12 in fiscal 2007) and closed no stores (compared to selling our only Del store located in Canada in fiscal 2007). Gross margin increased 7.0% to $912.3 million compared to $852.7 million in 2007. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased to 30.3% for fiscal 2008 compared to 31.5% for fiscal 2007. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from a substantial increase in the LIFO provision. The LIFO provision increased by $37.6 million to $42.8 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $5.2 million in fiscal 2007. The increase is due to significant inflation (increases in costs for certain commodities, petroleum-based products and steel), a shift in the product mix towards higher turning, higher inflationary items and clearance activity. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 10 basis points to 23.8% in fiscal 2008 from 23.7% in fiscal 2007. This increase was due largely to occupancy and payroll expenses relating to new stores, which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain average, offset by an aggressive expense management program. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 18.9% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due mainly to costs associated with new stores. Net interest expense decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to $2.1 million in fiscal 2008 from $5.0 million in fiscal 2007. This decrease is directly related to a lower average debt balance primarily due to a reduction in stock repurchase activity in 2008, as compared to 2007. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.6% for fiscal 2008 compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2007, resulting primarily from increases in state tax rates. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2008 decreased 14.9% to $81.9 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $96.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. During 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of stock for $53.9 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program. In 2007, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a total cost of $150.0 million. 26 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, commitments available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively. Financial markets experienced extreme volatility in 2008 and 2009 amid negative developments in housing and mortgage-related activities, weakness of major financial institutions, governmental actions, and negative economic developments. These conditions have resulted in disruptions in credit and lending activities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments. Our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. We have experienced no inability by our banks to meet borrowing requests. We have a diversified banking group which we believe should help mitigate any potential disruptions, if one occurs. Working Capital At December 26, 2009, we had working capital of $415.7 million, a $132.5 million increase from December 27, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): 2009 2008 Variance Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 172.9 $ 37.0 $ 135.9 Inventories 601.2 603.4 (2.2 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 42.3 41.9 0.4 Deferred income taxes 17.9 1.7 16.2 834.3 684.0 150.3 Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 273.2 $ 286.8 $ (13.6 ) Accrued expenses 137.4 113.5 23.9 Income taxes payable 7.6 7.6 Current portion of capital lease obligation 0.4 0.5 (0.1 ) 418.6 400.8 17.8 Working capital $ 415.7 $ 283.2 $ 132.5 In comparison to prior year end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in cash. The increase in cash resulted principally from stronger earnings, a decrease in net repayments under the revolving credit agreement, reduced share repurchase activity, and a decline in average inventory per store and capital expenditure activity. This was partially offset by increased accrued expenses principally as a result of timing of payments and higher incentive compensation accruals over the prior year. We have aggressively managed inventory and reduced our average inventory per store due to planned inventory management initiatives while improving our in stock levels. Accounts payable has also declined as a result of more timely payments on accounts payable in order to capture payment discounts offered by our vendors. Trade credit arises from our vendors granting payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product. Certain vendors offer payment discounts for payments made within a shorter period, typically within 10 to 15 days. Borrowings and Credit Facilities We are party to a Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the Credit Agreement ), which provides for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively). The Credit Agreement has an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments). The Credit Agreement is unsecured and matures in February 2012, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. 27 Table of Contents At December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. There were $35.2 million and $25.1 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% at December 26, 2009) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) (0.23% at December 26, 2009) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.50% at December 26, 2009). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 26, 2009). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent). The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR. The Credit Agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 26, 2009. Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt and repurchase of the Company common stock. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 215.3 $ 217.7 $ 154.8 Net cash used in investing activities (73.8 ) (88.4 ) (82.6 ) Net cash used in financing activities (5.6 ) (105.5 ) (85.1 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 135.9 $ 23.8 $ (12.9 ) Operating Activities The $2.4 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2009 2008 Variance Net income $ 115.5 $ 81.9 $ 33.6 Depreciation and amortization 66.3 60.7 5.6 Stock compensation expense 12.1 12.3 (0.2 ) Deferred income taxes (13.6 ) 1.6 (15.2 ) Inventories and accounts payable (11.4 ) 61.0 (72.4 ) Accrued expenses 23.9 (2.1 ) 26.0 Income taxes currently payable 7.6 (5.9 ) 13.5 Other, net 14.9 8.2 6.7 Net cash provided by operations $ 215.3 $ 217.7 $ (2.4 ) Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments. Inventory levels decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a continued focus on inventory management in 2009. Accounts payable levels have decreased at a greater rate as a result of more timely payments to capture payment discounts offered by vendors. The $62.9 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2008 2007 Variance Net income $ 81.9 $ 96.2 $ (14.3 ) Depreciation and amortization 60.7 51.1 9.6 Stock compensation expense 12.3 10.6 1.7 Deferred income taxes 1.6 7.0 (5.4 ) Inventories and accounts payable 61.0 (11.9 ) 72.9 Accrued expenses (2.1 ) 4.3 (6.4 ) Income taxes currently payable (5.9 ) (6.5 ) 0.6 Other, net 8.2 4.0 4.2 Net cash provided by operations $ 217.7 $ 154.8 $ 62.9 28 Table of Contents The improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments. Inventory levels decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to an increased focus on inventory management. Investing Activities Investing activities used $73.8 million, $88.4 million and $82.6 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures. Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $ 31.7 $ 39.8 $ 38.1 Existing store properties acquired from lessor 8.5 6.8 Existing stores 18.4 10.0 18.3 Distribution center capacity and improvements 4.3 16.2 3.3 Information technology 17.6 17.2 17.4 Corporate and other 2.0 0.1 0.1 $ 74.0 $ 91.8 $ 84.0 Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology. The costs reflected above are typically building improvements, as we lease the majority of our facilities. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $90 million and $100 million in fiscal 2010. While we plan to open approximately the same number of stores in 2010 compared to 2009, we expect to have additional capital expenditures next year including a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to improve throughput and efficiencies in the distribution center network and other efficiency-driving system enhancements in 2010. Financing Activities Financing activities used $5.6 million, $105.5 million, and $85.1 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2009 is mainly the result of share repurchase activity and borrowings and repayments under the Credit Agreement. We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 26, 2009, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $181.0 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. We repurchased approximately 0.4 million, 1.6 million and 3.2 million shares for a total cost of $15.3 million, $53.9 million and $150.0 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years. 29 Table of Contents Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 26, 2009 (in thousands): Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Less than More than Obligations 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years 5 years Operating leases $ 1,484,979 $ 161,214 $ 311,229 $ 280,260 $ 732,276 Capital leases (1) 3,242 526 352 292 2,072 Purchase obligations (2) 2,683 2,683 $ 1,490,904 $ 164,423 $ 311,581 $ 280,552 $ 734,348 (1) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2010. The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $35.2 million as of December 26, 2009. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) modified FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805, Business Combinations ( Topic 805 ). Previous guidance applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration; the revised guidance applies to all transactions or other events in which one entity obtains control over another. Topic 805 now defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control over one or more other businesses and defines the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control. It also requires the acquirer to recognize assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The revised guidance changes the treatment of acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs related to an acquisition that the acquirer expects but is not obligated to incur, contingent consideration associated with the purchase price and preacquisition contingencies associated with acquired assets and liabilities. Topic 805 retains the guidance for identifying and recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill. The revised guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted this revised guidance effective December 28, 2008 (fiscal 2009). Thus we are required to apply the revised guidance to any business acquisition which occurs on or after December 28, 2008, but this modification had no effect on prior acquisitions. In April 2008, the FASB modified FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, and FASB ASC 275, Risks and Uncertainties, for factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset. The modification requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement, consistent with its expected use of the asset, and is an attempt to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. We adopted the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset effective December 28, 2008 (fiscal 2009), and the guidance is applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. On April 9, 2009, the FASB modified FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, and FASB ASC 270, Interim Reporting, to extend the disclosure requirements related to the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. We adopted this guidance effective June 27, 2009. This guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. 30 Table of Contents In May 2009, the FASB modified FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued and requires entities to disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events. We adopted this guidance effective June 27, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2009-01 Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which establishes the FASB ASC. The FASB ASC is the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force, and related accounting literature. The FASB ASC reorganizes the thousands of GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure. Also included is relevant Securities and Exchange Commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections. We adopted ASU No. 2009-01 effective September 26, 2009. This impacted the Company notes to financial statements since all references to authoritative accounting literature are referenced in accordance with the FASB ASC. I tem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% at both December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008) or LIBOR (0.23% and 0.46% at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly, based on our performance (0.50% at both December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008). We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at both December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008). A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move (increase) in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately $111,000 of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the long-term debt. 31 Table of Contents
