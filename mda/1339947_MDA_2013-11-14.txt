We operate through two reporting segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income (loss). We define adjusted operating income (loss) for our segments as operating income (loss), before equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, including restructuring and other charges, when applicable. Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. When applicable, we use consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. For a reconciliation of our adjusted measures and discussion of the items affecting comparability refer to the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability . Media Networks Our Media Networks segment, which includes brands such as MTV, VH1, CMT, Logo, BET, CENTRIC, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., TeenNick, Nicktoons, Nick at Nite, Comedy Central, TV Land, SPIKE, Tr3s, Paramount Channel and VIVA, provides entertainment content and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. We create, acquire and distribute programming and other content to our audiences across multiple platforms, which allows our audiences to engage and interact with our content in a variety of ways: through traditional cable and satellite distribution, on connected TVs, PCs, tablets and other mobile devices, and using apps, browsers and other interfaces. Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising related to our content and marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from multichannel television service providers, including cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators and telecommunications operators, subscription and advertising supported video-on-demand services, and other distributors of our programming and program services, and (iii) ancillary revenues, which include consumer products licensing, brand licensing, home entertainment sales and licensing of our programming, television syndication and casual gaming. Demand and pricing for our advertising depends on our ratings and overall market conditions. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Audience 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) measurement ratings may vary due to the timing of availability of new episodes of popular programming, success of our programming and performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives for viewers, as well as variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure ratings. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, typically being highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year, and due to the timing of significant programming events, such as awards shows or premieres. Our agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases that provide us with a reasonably stable source of revenues. The amount of the fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of our affiliate agreements are staggered. Digital distribution agreements typically provide for one or more dates upon which each program becomes available for distribution on the digital platform. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized upon program availability and fluctuates depending on the initial availability of the programs licensed. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, volume of content available for sale during a particular period and acceptance of our or our partners products. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses are comprised of costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participation fees, integrated marketing expenses and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment produces, finances, acquires and distributes motion pictures and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures, Paramount Vantage, Paramount Classics, Insurge Pictures, MTV Films and Nickelodeon Movies brands. In general, motion pictures produced, acquired and/or distributed by the Filmed Entertainment segment are exhibited theatrically domestically and internationally, followed by their release in various windows, through download-to-own, download-to-rent, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, video-on-demand, pay television and subscription video-on-demand, broadcast television, basic cable television and syndicated television and, in some cases, by other exhibitors such as airlines and hotels (the distribution windows ). Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues worldwide principally from: (i) the theatrical release and/or distribution of motion pictures, (ii) home entertainment, which includes sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the motion pictures we release theatrically and direct-to-DVD, as well as content distributed on behalf of Viacom and third parties, (iii) licensing of film exhibition rights to television services, including video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, pay and basic cable television, broadcast television and syndicated television and (iv) ancillary revenues from licensing of film exhibition rights to digital platforms, providing production services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot, licensing of its brands for consumer products and theme parks, and distribution of content specifically developed for digital platforms and game distribution. 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Paramount releases films theatrically in domestic and international markets and generates revenues from audience ticket sales. Each motion picture is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which audience response is of fundamental importance. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales and licensing fees during the various other distribution windows. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases during the summer months and around holidays, particularly in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of home entertainment releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and by overall economic conditions, including consumer preference for rental or purchase and trends in discretionary spending. While the physical home entertainment industry continues to experience softness as consumer spending migrates from purchases of physical product to consumption via digital formats, the rate of decline has slowed compared to prior years. Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of film costs of our released feature films (including participations and residuals), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. We incur marketing costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows. Such costs are incurred to generate public interest in our films and are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition and profitability may not be realized until well after a film theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year ended September 30, 2013 vs. 2012 Consolidated Results of Operations Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2013 2012 $ % Revenues $ 13,794 $ 13,887 $ (93 ) (1 )% Operating income 3,836 3,901 (65 ) (2 ) Adjusted operating income 3,942 3,901 41 1 Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,407 2,345 62 3 Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 2,316 2,264 52 2 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 4.86 4.36 0.50 11 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 4.68 $ 4.21 $ 0.47 11 % See the section entitled Factors Affecting Comparability for a reconciliation of our adjusted measures to our reported results. 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $93 million, or 1%, to $13.794 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013. Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased $538 million, principally due to lower revenues across the distribution windows reflecting the number and mix of films, partially offset by higher ancillary revenues. Media Networks contributed a partially offsetting increase in revenues of $462 million principally reflecting higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Operating Income Adjusted operating income increased $41 million, or 1%, to $3.942 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013. Media Networks adjusted operating income increased $207 million, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by our continuing investment in original content. Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating income decreased $91 million, reflecting lower contribution from prior period releases and catalog, partially offset by higher ancillary revenues. Corporate expenses increased 31% in the period, primarily due to higher deferred compensation costs reflecting our increased stock price, as well as higher incentive compensation costs and professional fees. Adjusted results for 2013 exclude the impact of $106 million of restructuring and other charges. Including the impact of the current year restructuring and other charges, operating income decreased $65 million, or 2%. See the section entitled Segment Results of Operations for a more in-depth discussion of the revenues, expenses and adjusted operating income for each of the Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $52 million, or 2%, to $2.316 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013, principally due to the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above and a lower effective income tax rate. Our effective income tax rate was 32.9% in 2013, as compared with 34.0% in 2012, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is principally due to a change in the mix of domestic and international income. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.47 per diluted share to $4.68, principally reflecting fewer outstanding shares and the increase in earnings described above. Including gains from the sales of our 20% interest in HBO Pacific Partners, V.O.F. ( HBO Pacific Partners ) and our 22.5% interest in LAPTV, LLC ( LAPTV ) and restructuring and other charges in the current year, the loss on extinguishment of debt in the prior year, and discrete taxes in both years, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $62 million, or 3%, and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.50 per diluted share to $4.86. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax The $12 million loss from discontinued operations in 2013 primarily reflects interest on the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix Music Systems Inc. ( Harmonix ), a developer of music-based games, and the $364 million loss in 2012 principally reflects a $383 million pre-tax charge related to the dispute. Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations. Typical intersegment transactions include the purchase of advertising by the Filmed Entertainment segment on Media Networks properties and the purchase of Filmed Entertainment feature films exhibition rights by Media Networks . 40 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Media Networks Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) (in millions) 2013 2012 $ % Revenues by Component Advertising $ 4,855 $ 4,756 $ 99 2 % Affiliate fees 4,245 3,889 356 9 Ancillary 556 549 7 1 Total revenues by component $ 9,656 $ 9,194 $ 462 5 % Expenses Operating $ 3,405 $ 3,186 $ (219 ) (7 )% Selling, general and administrative 2,011 1,975 (36 ) (2 ) Depreciation and amortization 144 144 - - Total expenses $ 5,560 $ 5,305 $ (255 ) (5 )% Adjusted Operating Income $ 4,096 $ 3,889 $ 207 5 % Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $462 million, or 5%, to $9.656 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013, driven primarily by higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $17 million, or 1%, to $2.264 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally due to the increase in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above, partially offset by lower equity income due to a Viacom 18 equity loss. Our effective income tax rate was 34.0% in 2012, as compared with 34.3% in 2011, excluding the impact of discrete items. The decrease in the 2012 effective income tax rate is principally due to incremental tax benefits associated with qualified production activities.

Lower revenues from our 2012 releases were principally due to the difficult comparison against our 2011 release of Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Marvel Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger . Domestic and international theatrical revenues decreased 43% and 37%, respectively. Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact on international theatrical revenues. 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Home Entertainment Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased $228 million, or 12%, to $1.662 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012. Our 2012 releases included Marvel Captain America: The First Avenger , DreamWorks Animation Puss in Boots and Kung Fu Panda 2 , and Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol . Lower revenues from our 2012 releases were principally due to the difficult comparison against our 2011 releases including lower revenues from our third-party distribution arrangements. Domestic and international home entertainment revenues decreased 19% and 3%, respectively. Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact on international home entertainment revenues. International home entertainment revenues also include the international release of Transformers: Dark of the Moon while the domestic release benefitted our 2011 results. Television License Fees Television license fees decreased $23 million, or 2%, to $1.394 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, driven by the number and mix of available titles. Ancillary Ancillary revenues increased $13 million, or 3%, to $454 million in the year ended September 30, 2012. Higher digital revenues were partially offset by the comparison against the sale of the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel in 2011 for approximately $115 million. Expenses Filmed Entertainment segment expenses decreased $1.087 billion, or 19%, to $4.495 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012 due to decreases in operating and SG&A expenses. Operating Operating expenses decreased $1.062 billion, or 21%, to $3.935 billion in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally due to the mix of theatrical releases. Film costs decreased $598 million, or 22%. Distribution and other costs, principally print and advertising expenses, decreased $464 million, or 20%. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $23 million, or 5%, to $473 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally driven by savings from our 2011 restructuring actions and lower incentive compensation. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income decreased $16 million, or 5%, to $325 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, principally reflecting the difficult comparison against the benefit from the sale of the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel in 2011, partially offset by income attributable to fiscal 2012 increased digital revenues and cost savings from our 2011 restructuring actions. FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three years ended September 30, 2013 reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP. Results for the aforementioned periods, as discussed in the section entitled Overview , have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. Accordingly, when applicable, we use adjusted measures to evaluate our actual operating performance. 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) The following tables reconcile our adjusted measures to our reported results for the three years ended September 30, 2013. (in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended September 30, 2013 Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom (1) Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 3,836 $ 3,519 $ 2,407 $ 4.86 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring and other charges 106 106 74 0.15 Gain on sale of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV - (111 ) (111 ) (0.22 ) Discrete tax benefits - - (54 ) (0.11 ) Adjusted results $ 3,942 $ 3,514 $ 2,316 $ 4.68 Year Ended September 30, 2012 Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom (1) Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 3,901 $ 3,470 $ 2,345 $ 4.36 Factors Affecting Comparability: Extinguishment of debt - 21 13 0.02 Discrete tax benefits - - (94 ) (0.17 ) Adjusted results $ 3,901 $ 3,491 $ 2,264 $ 4.21 Year Ended September 30, 2011 Operating Income Pre-tax Earnings from Continuing Operations Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom (1) Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results $ 3,710 $ 3,245 $ 2,146 $ 3.61 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring 144 144 99 0.17 Extinguishment of debt - 87 54 0.09 Discrete tax benefits - - (52 ) (0.09 ) Adjusted results $ 3,854 $ 3,476 $ 2,247 $ 3.78 (1) The tax impact has been calculated using the rates applicable to the adjustments presented. Restructuring and Other Charges 2013 We incurred restructuring and other charges of $106 million in 2013. During the past year we have engaged in a global business transformation initiative to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. As a result, we have approved a restructuring plan which includes severance charges of $86 million. We also undertook a strategic review of some of our brands and incurred a $7 million intangible asset impairment charge resulting from the decision to abandon the asset and $13 million of charges related to management decision to cease use of certain 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) original and acquired programming on one of our Media Networks channels. The programming charge represents the acceleration of amortization of such programming into the fourth fiscal quarter and is included within Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. While we expect savings associated with the restructuring actions, other planned operating initiatives could offset some or all of the benefits in future periods. We expect that this restructuring plan will be substantially completed by September 30, 2014 and the majority of the severance will be paid in fiscal 2014. 2013 Restructuring and Other Charges (in millions) Media Networks Filmed Entertainment Total Severance charges $ 61 $ 25 $ 86 Asset impairment 7 - 7 Restructuring 68 25 93 Programming inventory 13 - 13 Total $ 81 $ 25 $ 106 2011 Restructuring charges of $144 million were incurred in 2011, of which $91 million were at our Media Networks segment and $53 million at Filmed Entertainment . The restructuring charges included $123 million of severance and $21 million of lease termination and other exit activities. The restructuring plan included workforce reductions and other exit activities across our operations, which were substantially completed as of September 30, 2013. Sales of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV In the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sales of our 20% interest in HBO Pacific Partners and our 22.5% interest in LAPTV, partnerships that own pay television channels under various brand names and that were accounted for under the equity method. The sales resulted in aggregate total proceeds of $124 million and gain of $111 million. The tax provision associated with the gains was offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards. Extinguishment of Debt 2012 In 2012, we redeemed all $750 million of our outstanding 6.850% Senior Notes due December 2055 (the 2055 Notes ) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of each 2055 Notes, plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of the redemption, we expensed the unamortized issuance costs associated with the 2055 Notes, which resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $21 million. 2011 In 2011, we conducted a cash tender offer to repurchase a portion of the $1.5 billion aggregate principal of our 6.25% Senior Notes due 2016. Our repurchase of $582 million of principal at a purchase price of $1,153.50 per $1,000 pursuant to the tender offer resulted in a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $87 million. Discrete Tax Items Our effective income tax rate was 32.9%, 34.0% and 34.3% for the year ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete tax items. In 2013, discrete tax benefits of $54 million, taken together with the effective income tax rate impact of the restructuring and other charges and the gain on sale of HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV investments, contributed 2.5 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) rate, which reconciles to the reported effective tax rate of 30.4%. The discrete tax benefits in 2013 principally reflect the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions, as well as the recognition of certain capital loss carryforward and tax credit benefits. In 2012, discrete tax benefits of $94 million, taken together with the impact of the 2012 loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 2.7 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 31.3%. The discrete tax benefits in 2012 include certain operating and capital loss carryforward benefits, as well as the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions. In 2011, discrete tax benefits of $52 million, taken together with the impact of restructuring charges and the 2011 loss on extinguishment of debt, contributed 1.6 percentage points of benefit to the effective tax rate, which reconciles to the reported effective rate of 32.7%. The discrete tax benefits in 2011 were principally related to the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. We have also accessed external financing sources such as our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and issuance of senior notes and debentures. Our principal uses of cash in operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, and interest and income tax payments. We also use cash for discretionary share repurchases under our stock repurchase program, as deemed appropriate, as well as quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate fees are principally earned from cable and satellite television operators. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations which contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. We use commercial paper borrowings, backstopped by our credit facility, to fund short-term domestic liquidity needs principally driven by the timing of our domestic operating cash flows and the amount of share repurchases in the period. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2013, of which $1.7 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and is deemed permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. While we currently do not intend or foresee a need for repatriating funds held in our foreign subsidiaries, should we require additional capital in the United States ( U.S. ), we could elect to repatriate these funds or access external financing. Repatriating funds could result in a higher effective tax rate and cash taxes paid. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities together with our credit facility, provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our credit facility. There can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be acceptable to us. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) We may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.555 billion in the year ended September 30, 2013, decreased by $173 million in the year ended September 30, 2012 and increased $184 million in the year ended September 30, 2011. The net change in cash and cash equivalents is detailed below: Cash Flows Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Cash provided by operations $ 3,083 $ 2,498 $ 2,644 Net cash flow used in investing activities (335 ) (256 ) (227 ) Net cash flow used in financing activities (1,159 ) (2,413 ) (2,227 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34 ) (2 ) (6 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,555 $ (173 ) $ 184 Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $3.083 billion for the year ended September 30, 2013, an increase of $585 million compared with 2012. The increase reflects favorable working capital, principally driven by lower income tax payments. Cash provided by operations was $2.498 billion for the year ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of $146 million compared with 2011. The decrease principally reflects the timing of annual incentive compensation payments as a result of our 2010 fiscal year end change and payments related to our 2011 restructuring actions, partially offset by the comparison against the payment of a premium on our debt extinguishment in 2011. In addition, 2012 included $1 million of cash provided by discontinued operations as compared to $21 million of cash used in discontinued operations in 2011. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $335 million for the year ended September 30, 2013, compared with $256 million in 2012. The increase reflects a $215 million increase in payments related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix, partially offset by $124 million of proceeds received from the sales of our investments in HBO Pacific Partners and LAPTV. Cash used in investing activities was $256 million for the year ended September 30, 2012, compared with $227 million in 2011. The increase reflects a payment related to the Harmonix earn-out dispute, partially offset by lower spending on acquisitions and investments. In 2011, cash used in investing activities included $72 million related to acquisitions and investments principally reflecting an investment in a European television programmer. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $1.159 billion for the year ended September 30, 2013, compared with $2.413 billion in 2012. Net cash used in 2013 was primarily driven by the settlement of share repurchases 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) totaling $4.664 billion and dividends of $555 million, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes and debentures for aggregate net cash proceeds of $3.732 billion and stock option proceeds of $403 million and $97 million from excess tax benefits, which represents the actual tax deductions in excess of amounts previously recognized. In 2012, cash used in financing activities was driven by share repurchase payments of $2.809 billion and dividends of $554 million, partially offset by the net impact of our senior notes issuances and debt repayments. Cash used in financing activities was $2.413 billion for the year ended September 30, 2012, compared with $2.227 billion in 2011. The net outflow was primarily driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $2.809 billion and dividends of $554 million. The net impact of our issuance of $2.15 billion of senior notes and debentures and debt repayments of $1.315 billion contributed a partially offsetting inflow. In 2011, cash used in financing activities was driven by share repurchases of $2.45 billion and dividends of $417 million, partially offset by the net impact of our senior notes issuances and debt repayments. In May 2013, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share of Class A and Class B common stock from $0.275 per share, beginning with the dividend paid on July 1, 2013. Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt At September 30, 2013, total debt was $11.885 billion, an increase of $3.736 billion from $8.149 billion at September 30, 2012. The increase in debt reflects the impact of new issuances of senior notes and debentures. Debt September 30, (in millions) 2013 2012 Senior notes and debentures $ 11,695 $ 7,919 Capital leases and other obligations 190 230 Total debt $ 11,885 $ 8,149 Senior Notes and Debentures In November 2012, we issued 4.375% Senior Debentures due March 2043 (the 2043 Debentures ) with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million at a price equal to 97.755% of the principal amount. The proceeds, net of discount and other issuance fees and expenses, were $242 million. In December 2012, we issued an additional $1.196 billion of 2043 Debentures in exchange for a portion of our outstanding 6.875% Senior Debentures due 2036 and 6.750% Senior Debentures due 2037 totaling $844 million. There was no gain or loss recognized as a result of the exchange. In March 2013, we issued 3.250% Senior Notes due March 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $300 million at a price equal to 99.148% of the principal amount, and 4.875% Senior Debentures due June 2043 with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million at a price equal to 99.474% of the principal amount. The proceeds, net of discount and other issuance fees and expenses, were $542 million. In August 2013, we issued 2.500% Senior Notes due September 2018 with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a price equal to 99.423% of the principal amount, 4.250% Senior Notes due September 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $1.250 billion at a price equal to 98.968% of the principal amount and 5.850% 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Senior Debentures due September 2043 with an aggregate principal amount of $1.250 billion at a price equal to 99.353% of the principal amount. The proceeds, net of discount and other issuance fees and expenses, were $2.948 billion. We used the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of shares under our stock repurchase program with $2.0 billion used to augment our ongoing quarterly pace of share repurchases. Our outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is one acceleration trigger for certain of the senior notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under certain specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control. At September 30, 2013 and 2012, the total unamortized net discount related to the fixed rate senior notes and debentures was $425 million and $49 million, respectively. The increase reflects the impact of the issuances of senior notes and debentures during the year. Credit Facility In November 2012, we amended our revolving credit agreement, originally dated as of October 8, 2010, to, among other things, increase the amount of the credit facility from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extend the maturity date from December 2015 to November 2017. The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. The borrowing rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% based on our current public debt rating. The credit facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which we met at September 30, 2013. We also terminated two 364-day credit facilities with an aggregate amount of $600 million in November 2012. At September 30, 2013 and 2012, there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility. Commercial Paper At September 30, 2013 and 2012 there was no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2013, was $804 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 0.34%. Current Portion of Debt Amounts classified in the current portion of debt consist of the portion of capital leases payable in the next twelve months. The Senior Notes due in September 2014 are classified as long-term debt as we have the intent as well as the ability, through utilization of our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility due November 2017, to refinance this debt. Film Financing Arrangements From time to time we enter into film financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also have agreements with third parties, including other studios, to co-finance certain of our motion pictures. Stock Repurchase Program On August 1, 2013, we increased the size of our Class B common stock repurchase program from $10.0 billion to $20.0 billion. During 2013, we repurchased 69.2 million shares for an aggregate price of $4.8 billion. From October 1, 2013 through November 13, 2013, we repurchased an additional 3.2 million shares for an aggregate 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) purchase price of $270 million. As of November 13, 2013, we had $9.630 billion remaining capacity in our $20.0 billion stock repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded through a combination of debt and cash generated by operations, as deemed appropriate. During 2012 and 2011, we repurchased 59.9 million and 55.7 million shares under the program for an aggregate price of $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option, payable in a foreign currency, with respect to an international subsidiary. The put option expires in January 2016 and is classified as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the redeemable noncontrolling interest. In the course of our business, we both provide and receive the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. Guarantees Leases We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. ( Famous Players ). In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. These lease commitments amounted to approximately $485 million as of September 30, 2013. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or of the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We have recorded a liability of $195 million with respect to such obligations as of September 30, 2013. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees business models. Other We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds at September 30, 2013 were $43 million and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We and our venture partner each have a commitment to guarantee up to approximately $70 million of bank debt of Viacom 18. There were no borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2013 subject to this guarantee. We also have a remaining equity funding commitment of $15 million as of September 30, 2013. Legal Matters Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the legal matters described below and other litigation to which we are a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of continuing operations, financial position or operating cash flows. 54 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) In March 2007, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Google Inc. ( Google ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary YouTube, alleging that Google and YouTube violated and continue to violate our copyrights. We are seeking both damages and injunctive relief. In March 2010, we and Google filed motions for summary judgment, and in June 2010, Google motion was granted. In April 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court decision and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In December 2012, Google renewed its motion for summary judgment. In April 2013, the District Court granted Google renewed motion for summary judgment. We have appealed the District Court decision back to the Second Circuit where briefing, including the submission of amicus briefs, is underway. Our 2006 acquisition agreement with Harmonix, including the Rock Band franchise, provided that to the extent financial results exceeded specific contractual targets against a defined gross profit metric for the calendar years 2007 and 2008, former Harmonix shareholders would be eligible for incremental earn-out payments. In 2008, we paid $150 million, subject to adjustment, under this earn-out agreement. A private dispute resolution process was commenced as provided in the acquisition agreement to determine the final amount of the earn-out. In December 2011, the resolution accountants in the private dispute resolution process concluded that we owed an additional $383 million under the agreement, as compared to the additional $700 million sought by the former shareholders. In the same month, we commenced a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery to vacate the determination of the resolution accountants on the grounds that they improperly failed to consider arguments and evidence put before them, and we recorded a reserve of $383 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2011. We paid $84 million of this amount plus accrued interest of $3 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012. In August 2012, the former shareholders motion for summary judgment affirming the decision of the resolution accountants was granted. In September 2012, we appealed the decision of the Chancery Court to the Delaware Supreme Court. On July 16, 2013, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Chancery Court, and on August 6, 2013, we paid the shareholder representative approximately $327 million, which included interest and was fully reserved, in full satisfaction of the judgment. In addition, in December 2010, the shareholder representative filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking the release of approximately $13 million that was being held in escrow to secure the former shareholders indemnification obligations to us under the acquisition agreement. In May 2011, we filed a motion to dismiss a portion of the shareholder representative lawsuit that related to certain other claims as meritless, and in November 2011, the court dismissed those claims. In December 2012, the Delaware Chancery Court granted the shareholder representative motion for summary judgment on our indemnification claims. On October 7, 2013, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of the Chancery Court. In February 2013, Cablevision Systems Corporation filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Viacom industry standard practice of offering discounts for additional network distribution constituted a tying arrangement in violation of federal and New York state antitrust laws. Similar arrangements have been upheld by numerous federal and state courts, and Cablevision itself has advocated for the legality of such arrangements as a party in a recent federal case. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and filed a motion to dismiss on May 8, 2013. On July 12, 2013, Cablevision filed an amended complaint, and on August 23, Viacom once again moved to dismiss the action. Briefing on the motion is underway; in the meantime, discovery in the action has been stayed. In August 2012, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by a Viacom Class B stockholder against us and each member of our Board of Directors. The complaint purported to be a derivative action alleging that, between 2008 and 2011, we violated the terms of our 2007 Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan ) by allegedly using improper subjective criteria to determine the 55 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) bonuses paid to Messrs. Redstone, Dauman and Dooley in each of those years, which according to the complaint, constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the members of the Board of Directors. The plaintiff alleged that during this period Messrs. Redstone, Dauman and Dooley were paid more than the 2007 Plan permitted and the plaintiff sought to recover the amount of the overpayment, plus interest, for the Company. The plaintiff also alleged that adoption of the Viacom 2012 Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan ) required the vote of all Viacom stockholders and not simply holders of our voting Class A common stock. Accordingly, the plaintiff sought to enjoin any overpayment under the 2012 Plan until a new vote on that plan that included Class B stockholders occurred. The District Court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint on July 16, 2013. On July 31, 2013, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and briefing on the appeal is now underway. In 2006, Paramount and DreamWorks L.L.C. (now known as DW Studios L.L.C.) entered into a Multi-Picture Investment Agreement with Melrose Investors 2 LLC ( Melrose 2 ) in connection with the financing of a slate of up to thirty motion pictures distributed by Paramount. In late November 2011, the Melrose 2 investors filed a lawsuit in California state court against Paramount and DW Studios asserting a variety of claims in relation to Paramount accounting to the investors. The investors filed an amended complaint in October 2012. In early January 2013, the parties settled the dispute and Paramount re-acquired all of the Melrose 2 investors remaining interests in the film slate. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2013, our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,456 $ 515 $ 578 $ 275 $ 88 Operating leases (2) 1,712 193 328 254 937 Purchase obligations (3) 657 360 260 36 1 On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) 170 25 52 50 43 Debt 12,168 600 1,816 1,900 7,852 Interest payments 8,382 565 1,047 870 5,900 Other long-term obligations (5) $ 2,650 $ 1,686 $ 738 $ 218 $ 8 (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.162 billion relating to media networks programming and $294 million for talent contracts. (2) Operating leases include long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Capital lease obligations include capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. Note: Not included in the amounts above are payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $255 million, unrecognized tax benefits of $194 million, including interest and penalties, $15 million of funding commitments to joint ventures, interest payments to be made under our credit facility, $200 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease guarantees of approximately $485 million. The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. We expect to make contributions of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2014 to our funded pension plan. 56 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Brazilian Real, the Mexican Peso and the Canadian Dollar. We also enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs or programming obligations. The change in fair value of non-designated foreign exchange contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At September 30, 2013 and 2012, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $196 million and $176 million, respectively. In 2013, $178 million related to our foreign currency balances and $18 million related to future production costs and programming obligations. In 2012, $120 million related to our foreign currency balances and $56 million related to future production costs and programming obligations. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rates hedges outstanding at September 30, 2013 and 2012. Since the majority of our debt is fixed rate, we do not expect that a 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Viacom has issued senior notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2013, had an outstanding balance of $11.7 billion and an estimated fair value of $12.3 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the senior notes and debentures by approximately $884 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions which are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience 57 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. An appreciation of our critical accounting policies, those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements, is necessary to understand our financial results. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. Film Accounting Revenue Recognition Revenue we earn in connection with the exhibition of feature films by our Filmed Entertainment segment is recognized in accordance with the accounting guidance for producers or distributors of films. Our Filmed Entertainment segment principally earns revenue from the exhibition of feature film content based upon theatrical exhibition, followed by their release in various windows, through download-to-own, download-to-rent, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, video-on-demand, pay television and subscription video-on-demand, broadcast television, basic cable television and syndicated television. We recognize revenue from theatrical distribution of motion pictures upon exhibition. We recognize revenue from home entertainment product sales, net of anticipated returns, including rebates and other incentives, upon the later of delivery or the date that these products are made widely available for sale by retailers. We recognize revenue from the licensing of feature films for exhibition in television markets, when fixed, upon availability for airing by the licensee. We recognize revenue for video-on-demand and similar pay-per-view arrangements as the feature films are exhibited based on end-customer purchases as reported by the distributor. Original Production and Film Costs We capitalize original production, including original programming and feature film costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize the costs over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of amortization. We expense advertising costs as they are incurred and expense manufacturing costs, such as DVD manufacturing costs, on a unit-specific basis when we recognize the related revenue. Our estimated liabilities for residuals and participations are accrued using the individual-film-forecast-computation method based on ultimate revenues. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within ten years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of a feature film and throughout its life, we estimate the ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is domestic theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to domestic theatrical performance. Upon a film release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a 58 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing home entertainment products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. Upon a film initial release we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. For original programming, capitalized program costs are amortized over the projected useful life of the programming, depending on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is the program rating. Program ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance, directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in abandonment of a program, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of a film initial release) to develop the cash flows at each reporting period which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a title that is being assessed for impairment. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a title which is impacted by the title position within its product life cycle. Acquired Programming Rights We report an asset and liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. We record the transaction using the gross liability provision. The asset is amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming include the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming quarterly on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate fee revenue to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. 59 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Determining whether some or all of these criteria have been met involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. This includes the evaluation of multiple element arrangements for bundled advertising sales and content licenses, which involves allocating the consideration among individual deliverables within the bundled arrangement. Gross versus Net Revenue Recognition We earn and recognize revenues where we act as distributor on behalf of third parties. In such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management assessment of whether we act as the principal or agent in the transaction. To the extent we act as the principal in a transaction, we report revenues on a gross basis. Determining whether we act as principal or agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of whether we have the substantial risks and rewards of ownership under the terms of an arrangement. Our most significant distribution arrangements are in connection with our distribution agreement with CBS Corporation ( CBS ) and our continuing distribution relationship with DreamWorks Animation for the films we theatrically distributed. We distributed the final film under the DreamWorks Animation distribution arrangement in November 2012. Under the terms of these agreements, we generally are responsible for all out-of-pocket costs, primarily comprised of distribution and marketing costs. For the provision of distribution services, we generally retain a fee based upon a percentage of gross receipts and recover expended distribution and marketing costs on a title-by-title basis prior to any participation payments to the contracting parties of the films, except as it pertains to certain contractually agreed upon advance payments, if applicable. As primary obligor, revenue and related distribution and marketing costs for these arrangements are presented on a gross basis. Sales Returns, Allowances and Uncollectible Accounts In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of home entertainment products to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter, and, with respect to home entertainment product, is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. 60 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have a $19 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2013. This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. In computing our sales returns rate, sales include home entertainment revenues of our Filmed Entertainment and Media Networks segments. Home entertainment revenues of our Media Networks segment are included within Media Networks ancillary revenues. We also continually evaluate accounts receivable and establish judgments as to their ultimate collectability. Judgments and estimates involved include an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and an analysis of actual historical write-off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due. Using this information, management reserves an amount that is estimated to be uncollectible. An incremental change of 1% in our allowance for uncollectible accounts relative to our trade accounts receivables would have a $26 million impact on our operating results for the year ended September 30, 2013. Provision for Income Taxes As a global entertainment content company, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we have operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, legislation, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the tax characteristics of our income. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period and may result in fluctuations in our effective income tax rate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our income tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1% change in our effective income tax rate, excluding discrete items, would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $35 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. We permanently reinvest the earnings of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for which the earnings are permanently reinvested. Fair Value Measurements The performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to 61 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Selection of the appropriate valuation technique, as well as determination of assumptions, risks and estimates used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability requires significant judgment. Although we believe that the inputs used in our valuation techniques are reasonable, a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Either instance would have an impact on both our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Provided below are those instances where the determination of fair value could have the most significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations: Goodwill Goodwill at September 30, 2013 relates to our reporting units Music and Logo ($2.1 billion), Nickelodeon ($2.9 billion), Entertainment ($1.8 billion), BET Networks ($2.7 billion) and Paramount ($1.6 billion). We have elected to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test in 2013. We test goodwill for impairment on August 31 of each year. The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step, if necessary, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. To facilitate a better understanding of how these valuations are determined, a discussion of our significant assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis with respect to their impact on the estimated value of our reporting units, is provided below. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the budget and long-term business plans of each reporting unit. Such assumptions take into account numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated economic conditions, advertising sales and ratings trends, terms of affiliate license arrangements and anticipated terms of renewals, projected costs for production and programming, number and expected financial performance of films expected to be produced and distributed each year and changes in the reporting unit cost structures. Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into account our assessment of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weighted-average cost of capital. We also review marketplace data to assess the reasonableness of our computation of Viacom overall weighted average cost of capital and, when available, the discount rates utilized for each of our reporting units. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions: Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2014 through 2018. Cash flows beyond 2018 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 3%. In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value, we utilized a discount rate of approximately 9% to 11% for each of our reporting units. 62 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Based on our annual assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 20% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in an impairment condition. We have performed sensitivity analyses to illustrate the impact of changes in assumptions underlying the first step of the impairment test. Based on our annual assessment: a one percentage point decrease in the five year compound average growth rate of cash flow over the periods 2014 through 2018 would reduce the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units by approximately 4% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit; a one percentage point decrease in the perpetual growth rate would reduce the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 9% to 13% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit; and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 12% to 15% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets In determining whether finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., customer lists, film libraries) are impaired, the accounting rules do not provide for an annual impairment test. Instead, they require that a triggering event occur before testing an asset for impairment. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, first a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be written down to its fair value. If the intent is to hold the asset for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. OTHER MATTERS Related Parties National Amusements Inc. ( NAI ), directly and through a wholly-owned subsidiary, is the controlling stockholder of both Viacom and CBS. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NAI, serves as our Executive Chairman and Founder and as the Executive Chairman and Founder of CBS. Shari Redstone, who is Sumner Redstone daughter, is the President and a director of NAI, and serves as non-executive Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of both Viacom and CBS. George Abrams, one of our directors, serves on the boards of both NAI and Viacom, and Frederic Salerno, another of our directors, serves on the boards of both Viacom and CBS. Philippe Dauman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, also serves on the boards of both NAI and Viacom. Transactions between Viacom and related parties are overseen by our Governance and Nominating Committee. Viacom and NAI Related Party Transactions NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios, including Paramount. During the years ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Paramount earned revenues from NAI in connection with these licenses in the aggregate amounts of approximately $19 million, $19 million and $44 million, respectively. 63 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Viacom and CBS Corporation Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in transactions with CBS and its various businesses that result in the recognition of revenues and expenses by us. Transactions with CBS are settled in cash. Paramount earns revenues and recognizes expenses associated with its distribution of certain television products into the home entertainment market on behalf of CBS. Pursuant to its agreement with CBS, Paramount distributes CBS library of television and other content on DVD and Blu-ray disc on a worldwide basis. Under the terms of the agreement, Paramount is entitled to retain a fee based on a percentage of gross receipts and is generally responsible for all out-of-pocket costs, which are recoupable prior to any participation payments to CBS. In April 2013, Paramount and CBS extended the term of the agreement. Paramount also earns revenues from CBS through leasing of studio space and licensing of certain film products. The Media Networks segment recognizes advertising revenues and purchases television programming from CBS. The cost of the programming purchases is initially recorded as acquired program rights inventory and amortized over the estimated period that revenues will be generated. Both of our segments recognize advertising expenses related to the placement of advertisements with CBS. The following table summarizes the transactions with CBS as included in our Consolidated Financial Statements: CBS Related Party Transactions Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Consolidated Statements of Earnings Revenues $ 264 $ 285 $ 341 Operating expenses $ 327 $ 347 $ 434 September 30, 2013 2012 Consolidated Balance Sheets Accounts receivable $ 5 $ 7 Other assets - 1 Total due from CBS $ 5 $ 8 Accounts payable $ 3 $ 1 Participants' share and residuals, current 115 143 Program rights obligations, current 99 110 Program rights obligations, noncurrent 139 169 Other liabilities 15 24 Total due to CBS $ 371 $ 447 Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with our separation from CBS, effective as of January 1, 2006 (the separation ), we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company is obligated to indemnify the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any 64 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI Inc. or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent. The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth Viacom responsibilities with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and including the merger, the preparation and filing of income tax returns for such periods, disputes with taxing authorities regarding income taxes for such periods and indemnification for income taxes that would become due if the merger were taxable. Viacom is generally responsible for federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes for periods before the merger relating to Viacom respective businesses. Income tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and previously disposed businesses have been allocated in accordance with the principles applicable under the Separation Agreement for liabilities relating to those operations and businesses. Other income tax liabilities, including items that do not specifically relate to either business, will be shared equally. Viacom and CBS will generally be jointly responsible for managing any dispute relating to income taxes for which both parties may be responsible. Other Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in related party transactions with equity investees, principally related to investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities as more fully described in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These related party transactions primarily relate to the provision of advertising services, licensing of film and programming content, distribution of films and provision of certain administrative support services, for which the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows: 65 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Other Related Party Transactions Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2013 2012 2011 Consolidated Statements of Earnings Revenues $ 216 $ 309 $ 239 Operating expenses $ 63 $ 120 $ 83 Selling, general and administrative $ (17 ) $ (16 ) $ (16 ) September 30, 2013 2012 Consolidated Balance Sheets Accounts receivable $ 84 $ 114 Other assets 1 3 Total due from other related parties $ 85 $ 117 Accounts payable $ 4 $ 8 Other liabilities 26 17 Total due to other related parties $ 30 $ 25 All other related party transactions are not material in the periods presented.
