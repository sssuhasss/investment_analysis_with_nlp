ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions, applications and market leading products to a wide variety of markets. We operate in three distinct business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Our Agricultural Products segment primarily focuses on insecticides and herbicides, which are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects and weeds as well as pest control in non-agricultural markets. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications, ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis, specialty polymers and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, hydrogen peroxide, specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. 2008 Highlights 2008 was a year in which we experienced continued sales and earnings growth in all of our business segments. Consolidated revenue of $3,115.3 million was up 18 percent from the prior year. Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals had revenue increases of 19 percent, 16 percent and 19 percent, respectively and had segment operating profit increases of 18 percent, 7 percent and 118 percent, respectively compared to the prior year period. We continue to be impacted by increases to raw material costs across all of our businesses and, to a lesser extent, higher energy costs. Our segment results for the year ended December 31, 2008 were driven by the following: Agricultural Products segment operating profits increased significantly, driven by higher sales in all regions and across all product lines as well as continued global supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher raw material and distribution costs. Specialty Chemicals segment operating profits were driven by strong commercial performance in BioPolymer, the inclusion of the ISP acquisition and volume growth in lithium, partially offset by increases in raw material and energy costs and higher export taxes. Industrial Chemicals segment operating profits increased significantly as a result of higher selling prices across the segment, particularly in soda ash and phosphates, coupled with improved power market conditions in Spain, where Foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and sells excess electricity into the Spanish electrical grid. These increases more than offset higher raw material costs. Included in our net income were various restructuring and other income and charges. There was a significant decrease in restructuring and other income and charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior period as a result of the gains on the Princeton and Foret asset sales described below, and reduced charges related to the phase out of operations at our Baltimore, Maryland agricultural chemicals facility. The Baltimore facility, which was part of our Agricultural Products segment, was closed in the second quarter of 2008. The announcement to phase out the facility was made in the second quarter of 2007. On March 18, 2008, we completed the sale of our 158-acre Princeton research center to the Princeton HealthCare System. Gross proceeds from the sale were $62.5 million and net proceeds after offsets, commissions and fees totaled approximately $60 million. The gain on the sale was $29.0 million which is included in Restructuring and other charges (income) in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. 28 Table of Contents In February 2008, we completed the sale of Foret sodium sulfate assets. Foret is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment. We recognized a gain on the sale of these assets of $3.6 million which is included in Restructuring and other charges (income) in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net proceeds from the transaction were $16.7 million. In August 2008, we acquired the hydrocolloids ingredients business of International Specialty Products (ISP). This acquisition is intended to strengthen our position in hydrocolloids and enhance service to the global customers in food, pharmaceutical and specialty industries. Under the agreement, we acquired ISP alginates and food blends business (other than ISP Germinal blending business based in Brazil), including ISP Girvan, Scotland, manufacturing facility and employees. The results of operations of the ISP business are included in the Specialty Chemicals segment beginning on the acquisition date of August 18, 2008. In September 2008, we acquired shares and assets comprising the food ingredients business of the Co-Living Group. The acquisition is intended to enhance our position in supplying specialty hydrocolloid products and services to the rapidly growing food ingredient market in China. The results of operations of the CoLiving business are included in the Specialty Chemicals segment beginning on the acquisition date of September 27, 2008. 2009 Outlook In 2009, despite the challenging global economic conditions, we expect continued growth in our revenue and earnings. The increase in revenue is expected to be driven by higher volumes and selling prices across most regions in our Agricultural Products segment, strong commercial performance in BioPolymer and the full year inclusion of the ISP and CoLiving acquisitions in our Specialty Chemicals segment, as well as higher selling prices in our Industrial Chemicals segment. These revenue increases are expected to be partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation in our Industrial Chemicals segment. The increase in earnings is expected to be driven by higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity initiatives in our Agricultural Products segment, higher sales in our Specialty Chemicals segment and higher prices in our Industrial Chemicals segment. Our earnings growth is expected to be offset by higher raw material and energy costs in our Specialty Chemicals segment, increased spending on growth initiatives in our Agricultural Products segment, lower volumes and higher raw material and other input costs in our Industrial Chemicals segment, and higher pension expenses. We expect cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2008, 2007 and 2006 Overview The following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to net income as seen through the eyes of our management. For management purposes, we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses, other income (expense), net and corporate special income/(charges). Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in Millions) Revenue Agricultural Products $ 1,058.7 $ 889.7 $ 765.9 Specialty Chemicals 764.5 659.5 592.8 Industrial Chemicals 1,296.9 1,087.1 990.9 Eliminations (4.8 ) (3.4 ) (3.7 ) Total $ 3,115.3 $ 2,632.9 $ 2,345.9 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes Agricultural Products $ 245.2 $ 207.0 $ 149.9 Specialty Chemicals 152.0 142.7 118.8 Industrial Chemicals 201.4 92.5 96.7 Eliminations (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Segment operating profit 598.5 442.2 365.3 Corporate (49.8 ) (52.3 ) (46.2 ) Other income (expense), net (8.6 ) (12.0 ) 3.0 Interest expense, net (31.9 ) (34.9 ) (32.9 ) Corporate special income (charges): Restructuring and other income (charges) (49.6 ) (164.9 ) (76.8 ) Impairment of Perorsa joint venture (1.4 ) LIFO inventory correction adjustment 6.1 Purchase accounting inventory fair value impact (2.3 ) Gain from Astaris joint venture 0.4 Minority interest associated with restructuring and other income (charges) 1.4 Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.3 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 454.9 185.7 212.4 Provision for income taxes 125.4 29.0 68.3 Income from continuing operations 329.5 156.7 144.1 Discontinued operations, net of income taxes (24.9 ) (24.3 ) (12.8 ) Net income 304.6 132.4 131.3 The below chart, which is provided to assist readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). These items are excluded by us in the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. These items are discussed in detail within the Other results of operations section that follows. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in Millions) Net income includes the following after-tax charges (gains): Corporate special charges (income) 30.3 98.2 59.1 Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.2 ) Discontinued operations 24.9 24.3 12.8 Tax adjustments (8.7 ) (15.4 ) 12.5 30 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2008 and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2007. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart on page 30 under Overview . All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Segment Results For management purposes, segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures on businesses, restructuring and other charges, investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, LIFO inventory adjustments, amortization of inventory step-up from business acquisitions, and other income and expense items. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2008 2007 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,058.7 $ 889.7 $ 169.0 19 % Operating Profit 245.2 207.0 38.2 18 Revenue of $1,058.7 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period. North America revenues grew by nine percent, Europe, Middle East and Africa by 33 percent, Asia by 12 percent and Latin America by 22 percent. Revenue benefited from favorable global agrochemical market conditions, increased planted acres in key crops, new product introductions and selective price increases to offset higher input costs. Segment operating profit of $245.2 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year. The earnings from the higher revenue coupled with supply chain productivity improvements from the shutdown of the Baltimore manufacturing facility were partially offset by higher raw materials costs which had an unfavorable period over period impact on operating profit by $35.5 million. To a lesser extent, higher selling costs to support the higher revenues also impacted operating profit in 2008. In 2009, full-year revenue growth in the mid-single digits is expected, driven by higher volumes and selling prices across most regions partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Full-year segment operating profit is expected to increase approximately 5 10 percent, as higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity initiatives are partially offset by spending on growth initiatives. In our Agricultural Products segment, several products are undergoing re-registration in the U.S. and/or a comparable regulatory review by EU governmental authorities. In August 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued its Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision ( IRED ) for our carbofuran insecticide. The IRED proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the United States, subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses while maintaining tolerances for imported commodities (bananas, coffee, rice and sugarcane). The EPA reiterated its proposal in January 2008 with the issuance of a draft Notice of Intent to Cancel. In February 2008, the EPA convened a Scientific Advisory Panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to the draft Notice of Intent to Cancel carbofuran. At this meeting, the EPA and FMC presented their views on the relevant scientific assessments of carbofuran. Separately, the US Department of Agriculture issued 31 Table of Contents its comments on the draft cancellation notice, stating that carbofuran should continue to be registered. On July 24, 2008, the EPA published a proposal to revoke all carbofuran tolerances under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in advance of any issuance of a final Notice of Intent to Cancel under the federal pesticide law. We have responded to that notice, expressing our strong disagreement with the EPA proposal to revoke tolerances and our belief that carbofuran residues on food do not pose a threat to human health. If the EPA chooses to revoke tolerances or issue a final Notice of Intent to Cancel which continues to eliminate all carbofuran uses, FMC plans to challenge such decision by requesting review by an administrative law judge. Meanwhile, FMC can continue to sell carbofuran in the United States at this time. Should the EPA issue a final decision to revoke tolerances, the EPA will also decide on when the revocation will take effect. If tolerances are revoked immediately and we cannot obtain a stay of such decision, sales of carbofuran into the relevant crops will be negatively impacted. We expect a final EPA decision on the tolerance revocation proposal in the first half of 2009. The conclusion of any subsequent administrative hearing(s) might take as long as a year from the issuance of a final revocation order. We do not know EPA timing on a final Notice of Intent to Cancel the carbofuran registration, though EPA has said it intends to issue such notice after the tolerance revocation decision. In November 2006, the European Union ( EU ) Commission Standing Committee on Animal Health and Food Chain voted not to include our carbofuran, carbosulfan and cadusafos products on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the EU. We believe the Committee decision was based on a flawed underlying scientific review and a failure to take into account all available data. In June 2007, the European Commission published its decisions not to include carbofuran, carbosulfan and cadusafos on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the EU. The published decisions required EU Member States to de-register the products within six months, and so, FMC ceased its sales of these products in December 2007. We disagreed with the Commission and initiated litigation in the European Community courts, seeking annulment of the carbofuran and carbosulfan decisions; in February 2009, we withdrew those cases. We have also re-submitted cadusafos, carbofuran and carbosulfan for approval on the official list. The outcome of our regulatory resubmissions is uncertain. As expected, the lost sales attributable to the cancellation of EU registrations for carbofuran, carbosulfan and cadusafos had a modest negative impact in this region in 2008, but growth in other products, new registrations and/or label expansions more than offset the unfavorable impact. We intend to defend vigorously all our products in the U.S. and EU regulatory processes. Several of FMC pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2009 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration in countries around the world. In the EU, two of our pyrethroid insecticide products, bifenthrin and zeta-cypermethrin, will be considered for inclusion on the official list of EU-approved active ingredients in 2009. In January 2009, we were informed that the Standing Committee voted in favor of including zeta-cypermethrin on the official list; bifenthrin has not yet been put on the agenda for decision by the Standing Committee. We expect to have a final decision from the Commission on these products by the end of 2009. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2008 2007 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 764.5 $ 659.5 $ 105.0 16 % Operating Profit 152.0 142.7 9.3 7 Revenue of $764.5 million increased 16 percent versus the prior year period of which four percent was the result of revenue from the two acquisitions that closed in the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, BioPolymer revenues increased 14 percent on volume growth, particularly in food and personal care and price increases to partially offset rising input costs. Lithium revenues increased eight percent versus the prior period where volumes, particularly in primary compounds and specialty organics, have increased. 32 Table of Contents Segment operating profit of $152.0 million was seven percent higher than the prior year. Price increases were offset by rising raw material and energy costs particularly for seaweed and wood pulp during the period of $41.3 million. To a lesser extent, the introduction of export taxes in Argentina in 2008 also reduced operating profits. In 2009, we expect full-year revenue growth in the high single digits as result of strong commercial performance in BioPolymer and the full year inclusion of the ISP and CoLiving acquisitions. Full-year segment operating profit growth of approximately 5-10 percent is expected, driven by higher sales partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2008 2007 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,296.9 $ 1,087.1 $ 209.8 19 % Operating Profit 201.4 92.5 108.9 118 Revenue of $1,296.9 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period. Alkali revenues increased 16 percent period-over-period primarily due to higher pricing. Soda ash volumes were up marginally. Peroxygen revenues period-over-period were higher by six percent with higher pricing being partially offset by volume declines in the fourth quarter due to the economic downturn. Foret revenues period-over-period were higher by 31 percent due mainly to higher pricing for phosphates, the effect of a stronger euro and improved electricity selling prices. Foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and sells excess electricity into the Spanish electrical grid. Segment operating profit of $201.4 million was 118 percent higher than the prior period. Higher pricing in Alkali and Foret more than offset the increase in raw materials, particularly for phosphate rock for the segment of $54.6 million period over period. For 2009, we expect full-year revenue to be level compared to prior year as higher selling prices are offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation. Full-year segment operating profit is expected to be flat to down 10 percent, as the higher prices are more than offset by lower volumes and higher raw material and other input costs. Other Results of Operations Corporate Expenses We recorded charges of $49.8 million in 2008 compared to $52.3 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to reduced legal costs associated with the legal settlement with Solutia that occurred in 2007. Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension expense. Other expense was $8.6 million in expense in 2008 compared to $12.0 million in expense in 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the mark to market impact of our deferred compensation liability, reduced incentive accruals, lower pension expense partially offset by a charge related to LIFO inventory reserves. Other Income (Expense), Net is included as a component of the line item Costs of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income. 33 Table of Contents Interest Expense, net The 2008 amount decreased to $31.9 million compared to $34.9 million in 2007 primarily due to the replacement of high-interest fixed-rate U.S. debt with lower interest floating-rate U.S. debt. Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other charges (income) were $49.6 million in 2008 compared to $164.9 million in 2007. Charges in this category for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the following: A gain on the sale of the Princeton property of $29.0 million, completed on March 18, 2008. A gain on the sale of Foret sodium sulfate assets of $3.6 million. Foret is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment. A $31.5 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision in 2007 to phase-out operations at our Baltimore, Maryland agricultural chemicals facility. These charges consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of approximately $27.0 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.4 million, and (iii) other shutdown charges of $3.1 million. We ceased production at this facility in the second quarter of 2008. A $5.6 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision in 2008 to phase-out operations at our Jacksonville, Florida facility. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of approximately $3.8 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.0 million and (iii) other shutdown charges of $0.8 million. A $10.0 million charge related to an agreement in principle to settle a class action alleging violations of antitrust law involving our hydrogen peroxide product in our Industrial Chemicals segment. A $1.0 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment extending their rights associated with the collaboration and license agreement discussed below. Severance costs due to workforce restructurings of $8.1 million, of which $3.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment, $0.9 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment and $4.0 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment. Asset abandonment charges of $7.0 million, of which $2.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment, $1.5 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $3.3 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment. Asset abandonment charges were determined based upon our decision and related analysis to abandon these assets before the end of their previously estimated life. Additionally, we recorded $2.8 million of other charges primarily related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $16.2 million of charges relating to continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge. The restructuring and other charges (income) of $164.9 million recorded in 2007 were a result of the following: Charges totaling $104.9 million for our phase-out of the Agricultural Products chemical facility in Baltimore, Maryland in our Agricultural Products segment. These charges consisted of (i) plant and equipment impairment charges and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of approximately $98.7 million and (ii) severance and employee benefits of $6.2 million. Solutia legal settlement of $22.5 million in our Industrial Chemicals segment. This settlement was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York (where Solutia had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003) on May 1, 2007 without any appeal having been taken. Asset abandonment charges of $12.2 million at Foret which is part of our Industrial Chemicals business. These charges include an impairment charge of $8.2 million related to a co-generation facility at Foret. This facility produced electric power and thermal energy by co-generation for use at one of Foret production properties. Additionally, we abandoned certain fixed assets also at Foret and recorded impairment charges of $4.0 million. 34 Table of Contents We recorded $1.8 million of charges related to an agreement to settle state court cases alleging violations of antitrust law involving our microcrystalline cellulose product ( MCC ) in our Specialty Chemicals segment. A $2.0 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment acquiring the original rights under a collaboration and license agreement with a third-party company for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights as well as acquiring the rights from a third-party company to develop their proprietary fungicide. $6.8 million of severance costs, of which $5.6 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment. $1.1 million of asset abandonment charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment and $3.4 million of other charges primarily in our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments. Asset abandonment charges were determined based upon our decision and related analysis to abandon these assets before the end of their previously estimated life. $10.2 million relating to continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge. Impairment of Perorsa joint venture represents a $1.4 million charge related to the impairment of our Perorsa joint venture in our Industrial Chemicals segment. On the consolidated statements of income this charge is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2008. LIFO inventory correction adjustment represents a non-cash gain of $6.1 million related to an adjustment to our last in, first out (LIFO) inventory reserves as a result of a correction in determining our initial LIFO inventory base year. This gain was recorded to Costs of sales and services for the year ended December 31, 2007 in the consolidated statements of income. Purchase accounting inventory adjustment was a $2.3 million charge related to amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from purchase accounting associated with acquisitions that closed in the third quarter of 2008 in our Specialty Chemicals segment. In purchase accounting, inventory is stepped up from its cost value to estimated selling prices less costs to sell. On the consolidated statements of income, this charge is included in Costs of sales and services for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gain from Astaris joint venture represents a gain of $0.4 million representing the difference between the carrying value of our remaining investment in the Astaris joint venture and cash received from the joint venture. This gain is included in Equity in (earnings) of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. In 2005, Astaris sold substantially all of the assets of its businesses and the buyers also assumed certain of the liabilities of Astaris. Minority interest associated with restructuring and other income (charges) represents $1.4 million associated with our decision to abandon a co-generation facility at Foret during the second quarter of 2007. This amount is shown in Minority interests on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. Loss on extinguishment of debt We recorded a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which represented losses related to the write off of certain deferred financing fees related to our previous credit agreement which was replaced in the third quarter of 2007 with our new Domestic Credit Agreement. These fees were previously a component of Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We did not incur any comparable charge for the year ended December 31, 2008. 35 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes We recorded a provision of $125.4 million in 2008 compared with a provision of $29.0 million in 2007 resulting in effective tax rates of 27.6 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the U.S. Income we earn domestically in typically taxed at rates higher than income earned outside the U.S. The mix of domestic income was impacted by significantly lower Baltimore restructuring charges incurred during 2008 compared to 2007. The effective tax rates were also impacted by tax adjustments recorded during 2008 and 2007. These tax adjustments are described below. 2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $8.7 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable conclusions to tax audits. Partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years tax matters. 2007 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $15.4 million and primarily include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances. These valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized. Partially offsetting these valuation adjustments were charges associated with adjustments for prior years tax matters. Discontinued operations, net of income tax Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $24.9 million in 2008 versus a loss of $24.3 million in 2007. The 2008 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. The 2007 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Middleport, Front Royal and Modesto sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Net income Net income increased to $304.6 million in 2008 compared with $132.4 million in 2007 primarily due to higher profits in all three of our segments and significantly reduced restructuring and other charges (income). Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2007 and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart on page 30 under Overview . All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Segment Results Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2007 2006 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 889.7 $ 765.9 $ 123.8 16 % Operating Profit 207.0 149.9 57.1 38 36 Table of Contents Revenue in Agricultural Products was $889.7 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior year. Revenues in Latin America grew by 28 percent; Europe, Middle East and Africa grew by 12 percent; Asia grew by 18 percent; and North America revenues declined by two percent. All crop markets benefited from higher commodity prices and, in addition, Brazil benefited from increased planted acres. Sales growth in Europe was driven by increased demand for biofuels crops, new product introductions and the benefits of the stronger Euro. In Asia, sales increased due to better growing conditions in several countries. North America revenues declined due primarily to weak housing markets and increased competitiveness in non-crop markets. Segment operating profit was $207.0 million, an increase of 38 percent from the year earlier, as a result of the higher revenue and favorable product mix. Selling and distribution costs increased $16.3 million to support the higher revenues. Additionally, higher energy and raw materials costs were offset by continued global supply chain productivity improvements. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2007 2006 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 659.5 $ 592.8 $ 66.7 11 % Operating Profit 142.7 118.8 23.9 20 Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $659.5 million, an increase of 11 percent versus the prior year. BioPolymer revenues increased nine percent on strong commercial performance in both pharmaceutical and food markets. Lithium revenues increased 16 percent driven by higher selling prices for primary lithium compounds. Segment operating profit of $142.7 million increased 20 percent versus the prior year due to higher sales, improved mix, which more than offset increased raw material and energy costs of $15.4 million. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2007 2006 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,087.1 $ 990.9 $ 96.2 10 % Operating Profit 92.5 96.7 (4.2 ) (4 ) Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $1,087.1 million, an increase of 10 percent versus the prior year. Alkali revenues increased nine percent period-over-period primarily due to higher pricing. Soda ash volumes were up marginally. Peroxygen revenues period-over-period were three percent higher due to higher volumes. Foret revenues period-over-period were higher by 13 percent with higher volumes being offset by lower prices for phosphates, hydrogen peroxide, bleachers and the sales of electricity. Foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and excess electricity is sold into the Spanish electrical grid. Segment operating profit of $92.5 million decreased four percent versus the prior year, due to higher energy and raw material costs across the segment of $24.9 million more than offset the positive impact of higher sales. Other Results of Operations Corporate Expenses We recorded charges of $52.3 million in 2007 compared to $46.2 million in 2006, due to higher incentive compensation expenses. Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. 37 Table of Contents Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension expense. Other expense increased to $12.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to income of $3.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. During 2006 inventory balances were reduced in the U.S. due to liquidation of inventory quantities carried at lower costs as compared with the cost of 2006 purchases. This resulted in income recorded in 2006 related to a decrease in LIFO inventory reserves that did not repeat in 2007. Other Income (Expense), Net is included as a component of the line item Costs of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income. Interest expense, net The 2007 amount increased to $34.9 million compared to $32.9 million in 2006 primarily due to a reduction in interest income caused by lower cash balances. Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other charges (income) were $164.9 million in 2007 compared to $76.8 million in 2006. Charges in this category for the year ended December 31, 2007 include the following: Charges totaling $104.9 million for our phase-out of the Agricultural Products chemical facility in Baltimore, Maryland in our Agricultural Products segment. These charges consisted of (i) plant and equipment impairment charges and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of approximately $98.7 million and (ii) severance and employee benefits of $6.2 million. Solutia legal settlement of $22.5 million in our Industrial Chemicals segment. This settlement was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York (where Solutia had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003) on May 1, 2007 without any appeal having been taken. Asset abandonment charges of $12.2 million at Foret which is part of our Industrial Chemicals business. These charges include an impairment charge of $8.2 million related to a co-generation facility at Foret. This facility produced electric power and thermal energy by co-generation for use at one of Foret production properties. Additionally, we abandoned certain fixed assets also at Foret and recorded impairment charges of $4.0 million. We recorded $1.8 million of charges related to an agreement to settle state court cases alleging violations of antitrust law involving our microcrystalline cellulose product ( MCC) in our Specialty Chemicals segment. A $2.0 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment acquiring the original rights under the collaboration and license agreement with a third-party company for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights and acquiring the rights from a third-party company to develop their proprietary fungicide. $6.8 million of severance costs, of which $5.6 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment. $1.1 million of asset abandonment charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment and $3.4 million of other charges primarily in our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments. Asset abandonment charges were determined based upon our decision and related analysis to abandon these assets before the end of their previously estimated life. $10.2 million relating to continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge. The restructuring and other charges (income) of $76.8 million recorded in 2006 were a result of the following: We reached an agreement to settle a federal class action lawsuit, as well as other individual claims, alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose ( MCC ) product in our Specialty Chemicals business in the amount of $25.7 million. 38 Table of Contents We committed to the abandonment of a plant building in our Agricultural Products segment and recorded a charge of $6.0 million. The European Commission imposed a fine on us regarding alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1997-1999 which we have appealed. This fine is associated with our Industrial Chemicals segment. We have recorded a charge of 25 million ($30 million at then-prevailing exchange rates) for this fine. We announced a plan to redeploy our discovery research and development resources within our Agricultural Products segment to shorten the innovation cycle and accelerate the delivery of new product and technologies. We incurred $3.4 million of severance charges as a result of this decision. We also abandoned assets as a result of these decisions and recorded a charge of $1.9 million. A charge of $2.0 million related to our Agricultural Products segment entering into development agreements with a third-party company whereby we were given the right to develop further one of such party products in certain geographic markets. Additional restructuring charges for 2006 totaled $7.8 million. These charges included $1.2 million of asset abandonment charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.3 million of severance costs were recorded in our Specialty Chemicals segment due to a workforce restructuring. We also recorded $5.4 million relating to continuing environmental sites. Offsetting these charges was a gain of $0.6 million in our Specialty Chemicals segment from the completion of the sale of our previously disclosed assets held for sale related to our Copenhagen, Denmark carrageenan plant which we closed in 2005. The gain represented the difference between the asset held for sale balance and the final proceeds. The final proceeds from the sale totaled $9.6 million. Additional restructuring and other charges were recorded in Industrial Chemicals for $0.5 million. LIFO inventory correction adjustment represents a non-cash gain of $6.1 million related to an adjustment to our last in, first out (LIFO) inventory reserves as a result of a correction in determining our initial LIFO inventory base year. This gain was recorded to Costs of sales and services for the year ended December 31, 2007 in the consolidated statements of income. Gain from Astaris joint venture represents a gain of $0.4 million representing the difference between the carrying value of our remaining investment in the Astaris joint venture and cash received from the joint venture. This gain is included in Equity in (earnings) of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. In 2005, Astaris sold substantially all of the assets of its businesses and the buyers also assumed certain of the liabilities of Astaris. Minority interest associated with restructuring and other income (charges) represents $1.4 million associated with our decision to abandon the co-generation facility at Foret during the second quarter of 2007. This amount is shown in Minority interests on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. Loss on extinguishment of debt We recorded a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 which represented losses related to the write off of certain deferred financing fees related to our previous credit agreement which was replaced in the third quarter of 2007 with our new Domestic Credit Agreement. We did not incur any comparable charge for the year ended December 31, 2006. Provision for income taxes We recorded a provision of $29.0 million in 2007 compared with a provision of $68.3 million in 2006 reflecting effective tax rates of 15.6 percent and 32.2 percent, respectively. The change in effective tax rates is the result of tax adjustments resulting in a tax benefit in 2007 as opposed to tax adjustments resulting in a tax 39 Table of Contents charge in 2006. These tax adjustments are described below. The change in effective rates is also a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the U.S. and the European Commission fine of 25 million ($30 million at then-prevailing exchange rates) incurred in 2006 that was nondeductible for tax purposes in 2006. 2007 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $15.4 million and primarily include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances. These valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized. Partially offsetting these valuation adjustments were charges associated with adjustments for prior years tax matters. 2006 tax adjustments were unfavorable in the amount of $12.5 million and primarily include charges associated with adjustments to deferred taxes. Discontinued operations, net of income tax Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $24.3 million in 2007 versus a loss of $12.8 million in 2006. The 2007 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Middleport, Front Royal and Modesto sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. The 2006 loss includes net charges of $27.3 million related to environmental issues and legal reserves and expenses related to previously discontinued operations. The charges in 2006 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites as well as to increase reserves for operating and maintenance activities. Offsetting these charges was a gain of $14.0 million from the sale of 23 acres real estate property in San Jose, California related to our former Defense business. This completed the sale of land that was formerly used by FMC defense business, which was divested in 1997. Net Income Net income increased to $132.4 million in 2007 compared with $131.3 million in 2006 and was primarily attributable to higher earnings in our Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals segments mostly offset by higher restructuring and other charges (income) due to the Baltimore facility shut down. Liquidity and Capital Resources Domestic Credit Agreement On August 28, 2007, we executed a new credit agreement (the Domestic Credit Agreement ) which provided for a five-year, $600 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including issuing letters of credit up to a $300 million sub-limit. The Domestic Credit Agreement also contains an option under which, subject to certain conditions, we may request an increase in the facility to $1 billion. There were no borrowings under the new facility at inception, and our prior credit agreement dated as of June 21, 2005 was terminated. Obligations under the prior credit agreement and related transaction costs, fees, and expenses for the new Agreement were paid with available cash. Loans under the new facility bear interest at a floating rate, either a base rate as defined, or the applicable euro currency rate for the relevant term plus an applicable margin. The margin is 0.35 percent per year, subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt. At December 31, 2008, the applicable borrowing rates under our Domestic Credit Agreement ranged from 0.82 to 3.25 percent per annum. European Credit Agreement On December 16, 2005, our Dutch finance subsidiary executed a credit agreement (the European Credit Agreement ) which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 220 million. Borrowings may be denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. FMC and our Dutch finance subsidiary direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the European Credit Agreement. 40 Table of Contents Loans under the European Credit Agreement bear interest at a euro currency base rate, which for loans denominated in euros is the Euro InterBank Offered Rate, and for loans denominated in dollars is London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) in each case plus a margin. The applicable margin under our European Credit Agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to FMC by each of Moody and S&P. At December 31, 2008 the applicable margin was 0.35 percent and the applicable borrowing rates under the European Credit Agreement ranged from 3.06 to 5.64 percent per annum. Among other restrictions, the Domestic Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement contain financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). Our actual leverage for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 1.0 which is within the maximum leverage of 3.5. Our actual interest coverage for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 20.0 which is within the minimum interest coverage of 3.5. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $157.2 million and $171.7 million in U.S. dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings under the European Credit Agreement, resulting in available funds of $150.2 million and $147.1 million, respectively. We had $203.0 million in borrowings under our Domestic Credit Agreement at December 31, 2008 compared to no borrowings at December 31, 2007. Letters of credit outstanding under the Domestic Credit Agreement totaled $151.5 million and $146.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Available funds under the Domestic Credit Agreement were $245.5 million at December 31, 2008 and $453.1 million at December 31, 2007. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $52.4 million and $75.5 million, respectively. We had total debt of $623.6 million and $545.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This included $592.9 million and $419.6 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $2.1 million and $77.7 million) at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Short-term debt, which consists of foreign borrowings, decreased to $28.6 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $47.9 million at December 31, 2007. The $97.7 million increase in total long-term debt at December 31, 2008 from December 31, 2007 was primarily due to increased borrowing under the Domestic Credit Agreement. Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $357.4 million for 2008 compared to $314.7 million for 2007 and $307.2 million for 2006. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations excluding noncash items partially offset by an increase in working capital to support our higher trading activities. The more significant noncash items included with our earnings include depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other charges (income) and deferred income taxes. Receivables increased as a result of stronger year over year sales in all of our businesses and particularly in our Agricultural Products business in Brazil where payment terms are generally longer than in our other businesses. In addition, sales activity of the recent acquisition of ISP in the third quarter of 2008 added $12 million to our receivables at December 31, 2008. Our collections experience for all businesses during the year has, with limited exceptions, shown no deterioration year over year. Inventories increased to support the needs of our higher trading activities and as a result of the higher energy and raw material costs, particularly for phosphate rock. Accounts payable increased mainly as a result of the higher inventory levels and the increased cost of raw materials. The net remaining change in the other working capital items primarily represents timing associated with a number of miscellaneous accruals and prepaid expenses as well as higher spending for asset retirement obligations. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations excluding noncash items partially offset by an increase in working capital to support 41 Table of Contents our higher trading activities. The more significant noncash items included with our earnings include depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other charges (income) and deferred income taxes. Receivables increased as a result of stronger year over year sales in all of our businesses and particularly in our Agricultural Products business in Brazil where terms are generally longer than in our other businesses. Inventories increased to support the needs of our higher trading activities and for temporary buffer stocks to manage the transition of the supply chain in Agricultural Products from our Baltimore plant, which was in the processes of being shutdown, to third party contract manufacturers. Accounts payable increased mainly as a result of the higher inventory levels. Cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was $49.8 million for 2008 compared to cash required of $45.1 million and $43.2 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to increased environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2008. The change in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to the absence of proceeds from the sale of land in San Jose, California partially offset by lower discontinued operations environmental spending. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations was for environmental remediation on discontinued sites. Discontinued environmental spending was $32.2 million in 2008 compared to $22.4 million in 2007 and $44.1 million in 2006. Cash required by investing activities for 2008 was $191.7 million compared to cash required by investing activities of $120.6 million in 2007 and cash required by investing activities of $109.8 in 2006. The increase in cash required in 2008 was driven primarily by our net acquisition spending of $90.6 million and an increase in our capital expenditure spending primarily in our Industrial Chemicals segment partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the Princeton property of $59.4 million and the sale of sodium sulfate assets of $16.7 million. The increase in cash required in 2007 was a result of lower proceeds from the sales of investments and assets held for sale and an increase in other investing activities which represents increases to long-term deferred costs. Cash required by financing activities for 2008 was $137.5 million compared to cash required by financing activities of $243.4 million in 2007 and cash required by financing activities of $198.5 million in 2006. The change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased borrowings under our committed credit facilities partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt and repurchases of common stock. The increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from the issuances of common stock which primarily represent cash received from the exercise of stock options. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we contributed approximately 2,000 and 470,000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of $0.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively, which is considered a non-cash activity. We had no such comparable activity in the year ended December 31, 2008. Other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2009 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, contributions to our pension plans, environmental spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facilities. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses. Projected 2009 capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with 2008 levels. Projected 2009 spending includes approximately $31.2 million of net environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $15.4 million in 2009 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend approximately $24.5 million in 2009 for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections. 42 Table of Contents During 2008, the world equity markets were down significantly, exemplified by the S&P 500 index in the U.S. being down 37 percent. Our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Plan ) assets fell from $829.4 million at December 31, 2007 to $ 563.9 million at December 31, 2008. Our U.S. Plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. We have reduced our expected return on our U.S. Plan assets from 8.75 percent in 2008 to 8.5 percent in 2009. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 9.51 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 2.75 percent, is between 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent for equities, and between 4.25 percent and 7.75 percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumptions for the rate of return on assets. This lower expected return on plan assets, along with decreased assets and the amortization of actuarial losses primarily associated with the equity market decline in 2008 are estimated to increase our net periodic benefit costs by approximately $5.7 million during 2009 compared to 2008. Under The Pension Protection Act of 2006, we are not required to make a minimum level of funding into the U.S. Plan during 2009, however, in order to reduce future funding volatility we intend to contribute $75 million in 2009 versus $30 million contributed in 2008 and 2007. We do not believe that the additional contribution will have a significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs. However a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the Plan in the future. In April 2008, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share. This represents an increase of $0.02 above our previous rate of $0.105 per share. We declared dividends aggregating $35.7 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2008, and $9.1 million of this amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. In April 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common stock. In October 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of our common stock. Although the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time, we expect that the program will be accomplished over a two-year period. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. We also reacquire shares from time to time in connection with the vesting and exercise of awards under our equity compensation plans. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 3,503,914 of our shares at an aggregate cost of $185.2 million under the publicly announced program. Commitments In 2001, we split FMC into separate chemical and machinery companies and we refer to the spun-off company, FMC Technologies, Inc. as Technologies throughout this Annual Report. We agreed to guarantee the performance by Technologies of a debt instrument (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2008, these guaranteed obligations totaled $0.8 million compared to $1.6 million at December 31, 2007. We guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method. The other equity owners provide parallel agreements. We also guarantee the repayment of a borrowing of a minority equity holder in a foreign subsidiary that we consolidate in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, these guarantees had maximum potential payments of $6.8 million and $6.9 million, respectively. 43 Table of Contents We also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Product customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $20.3 million and $29.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as Guarantees of vendor financing . Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. In connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. Our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. As such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. If triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. We have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees. We spun off FMC Technologies, Inc. ( Technologies ) in 2001. At this time, we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business, generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any period where Technologies is included in the consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries. The statute of limitations for the 2001 U.S. federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spin-off were raised during the IRS audit for 2000-2001, therefore any liability for taxes if the spin-off of Technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by Technologies has been favorably concluded. The tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items, which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 & beyond Total (in Millions) Debt maturities (1) $ 2.1 $ 157.7 $ 50.8 $ 203.0 $ 181.8 $ 595.4 Contractual interest (2) 26.3 25.9 17.8 13.9 181.8 265.7 Lease obligations (3) 30.2 28.4 26.1 23.2 111.0 218.9 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts 39.5 0.6 40.1 Purchase obligations (4) 36.5 18.9 13.9 12.3 16.2 97.8 Total (5) $ 134.6 $ 231.5 $ 108.6 $ 252.4 $ 490.8 $ 1,217.9 (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $388.8 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2008. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2008. Variable rates are market determined and will fluctuate over time. (3) Before recoveries. Includes payments related to our Princeton property discussed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. (4) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum 44 Table of Contents obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. (5) As of December 31, 2008 the liability for uncertain tax positions was $42.4 million and this liability is excluded from the table above. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid. Contingencies On January 28, 2005, we and our wholly owned subsidiary Foret received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. All of the significant European hydrogen peroxide producers also received the Statement of Objections. We and Foret responded to the Statement of Objections in April 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of June 2005. On May 3, 2006, we received a notice from the European Commission indicating that the Commission had imposed a fine on us and Foret in the aggregate amount of 25.0 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 1997-1999. In connection with this fine, we recorded an expense of $30.0 million (reflecting then-prevailing exchange rates) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. This expense was included as a component of restructuring and other charges (income). Since we are not required to make the payment during the appeal process, which may extend beyond one year, the liability has been classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Both we and Foret have appealed the decision of the Commission. During the appeal process, interest accrues on the fine at a rate, which as of December 31, 2008, was 4.0 percent per annum. We have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the European Commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest. At December 31, 2008, the amount of the letter of credit was 28.2 million (U.S. $39.4 million). In 2004, we also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the Northern District of California, which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the United States during the period 1994 through 2003. We have since learned that Degussa AG was a leniency applicant in the investigation and that Solvay, S.A. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals International B.V. have pled guilty to Sherman Act violations during the period July 1, 1998 through December 1, 2001. On December 29, 2008 we received notice from the Department of Justice that it has closed the investigation without filing charges against FMC. In connection with these two matters, in February 2005 putative class action complaints were filed against six U.S. hydrogen peroxide producers (and certain of their foreign affiliates) in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws. Federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees. Related cases were also filed in various state courts. All of the federal court cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). The District Court certified the class in January 2007. On December 30, 2008, the Court of Appeals vacated the class certification order and remanded the case for further proceedings in the District Court. Shortly thereafter, FMC reached an agreement in principle to settle with the class for $10 million, subject to final documentation and approval by the Court. This amount was included as a component of Restructuring and other charges (income) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Court has already finally approved settlements with four of the six original defendant groups, who collectively paid approximately $90 million. Seventeen companies (predominantly paper producers) have opted out of certain of the settlements with other defendants. Certain of the defendants in the class action have settled those opt out claims for undisclosed amounts. Six of the 17 opt outs have filed suit against FMC and Foret in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and one has sued FMC as well as two other producers. These cases have been assigned to the same judge as the class action. Two other opt out cases have been pending for some time against FMC and other hydrogen peroxide producers, and in August of 2008, Foret was added as a defendant to these cases. The stay of all these actions entered by the 45 Table of Contents District Court during the class certification appeal remains in place. Most of the state court cases have been dismissed, although some remain in California. In addition, putative class actions have been filed in provincial courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia under the laws of Canada. A motion for class certification is pending. Another antitrust class action previously brought in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product was settled for $25.0 million, the same amount paid by our codefendant Asahi Kasei Corporation. The Court approved this settlement in November 2006. The claims of plaintiffs who opted out of the class settlement were also settled late in 2006 for $0.7 million. The above amounts for 2006 have been reflected in Restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. The parties have also reached an agreement to settle a related state court case pending in California, for a total for $2.5 million, with the Company and Asahi Kasei each contributing $1.25 million. This settlement was approved by the California state court in November 2007. A third related state class action against FMC in Tennessee state court has been settled for $0.5 million. This settlement was approved by the Tennessee state court in November 2008. The above amounts for 2007 have been reflected in Restructuring and other charges (income) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. We have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies, including the matters described in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity . Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental obligations. We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision (ROD), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) that is submitted 46 Table of Contents by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2008 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies, and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2008. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued or as Other Assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2008 and determined that no impairment charge was required. 47 Table of Contents Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We recorded $6.9 million, $11.5 million and $15.1 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We are required to recognize in our consolidated balance sheet the total underfunded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans. The underfunded status is defined as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our net underfunded status recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was $376.2 million and $110.6 million, respectively. We made voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of $30.0 million in both 2008 and 2007. In addition, we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of $5.8 million and $3.0 million, for 2008 and 2007, respectively. We paid other postretirement benefits, net of participant contributions, of $4.7 million in both 2008 and 2007. Our estimated cash contributions for 2009 include approximately $6.1 million in nonqualified pension benefits, $4.1 million in other postretirement benefits, and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $75 million. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds, including Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) Aa-rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices. In selecting the discount rate for 2008, we placed particular emphasis on a yield-curve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows. The specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns (yields) from a portfolio of high-quality (Aa-graded or higher) bond investments constructed by our actuary. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 9.51 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. Given an 48 Table of Contents actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 2.75 percent, is between 8.75 percent and 10.75 percent for equities, and between 4.25 percent and 7.75 percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumption for the rate of return on assets. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $45.4 million at December 31, 2008 and $52.5 million at December 31, 2007, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $0.5 million, $3.7 million and $5.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $49.7 million at December 31, 2008 and $57.7 million at December 31, 2007, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $0.5 million, $6.1 million and $5.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $4.2 million, $4.0 million and $3.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $4.2 million, $4.0 million and $3.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the valuation allowance was $55.3 million and $65.1 million, respectively. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Dividends In April 2008, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share. This represents an increase of $0.02 above our previous rate of $0.105 per share. We declared dividends aggregating $35.7 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2008, and $9.1 million of this amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. Total cash dividends of $34.4 million, $29.7 million and $21.0 million were paid in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 49 Table of Contents
