Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash-settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write-off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, which the holders may require our Operating Partnership to repurchase in February 2012, for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. There remains an aggregate of approximately $626.2 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we used available cash to repay approximately $501.2 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.3 million, wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling 65 Table of Contents approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Gains on Sales of Real Estate On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale was deferred and has been recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $11.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of the project and recognized the remaining gain on sale totaling approximately $1.8 million. We have recognized a cumulative gain on sale of approximately $23.4 million. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten-year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 was approximately $67.3 million. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement, resulting in the recognition of the remaining deferred gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $1.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9 th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. On December 23, 2010, we acquired the outside member 33.3% equity interest in our consolidated joint venture entity that owns the Wisconsin Place Office property located in Chevy Chase, Maryland for cash of approximately $25.5 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810. The difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the outside member equity interest, totaling approximately $19.1 million, reduced additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership decreased by approximately $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in allocable income. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 126 properties, including properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2008 and owned through December 31, 2009, totaling approximately 30.1 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2008 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2009. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold. 66 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Portfolio Properties Acquired Portfolio Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,358,000 $ 1,344,408 $ 13,592 1.01 % $ $ 90 $ 7,244 $ 1,828 $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ $ $ 1,438,517 $ 1,389,609 $ 48,908 3.52 % Termination Income 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % Total Rental Revenue 1,372,410 1,356,851 15,559 1.15 % 90 7,244 1,828 73,273 43,283 1,452,927 1,402,052 50,875 3.63 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 479,983 477,172 2,811 0.59 % 46 1,274 274 20,542 10,538 501,799 488,030 13,769 2.82 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 892,427 879,679 12,748 1.45 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 951,128 914,022 37,106 4.06 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 898,846 889,041 9,805 1.10 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 957,547 923,384 34,163 3.70 % Other Revenue: Development and management services 34,878 30,518 4,360 14.29 % Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 75,447 72,365 3,082 4.26 % Loss from suspension of development 27,766 27,766 100.00 % Depreciation and amortization 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 321,681 304,147 17,534 5.76 % Total Other Expenses 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 424,894 376,512 48,382 12.85 % Operating Income 599,671 595,437 4,234 7.11 % 44 1,157 179 35,038 23,577 567,531 577,390 (9,859 ) (1.71 )% Other Income: Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures 12,058 (182,018 ) 194,076 106.62 % Interest and other 4,059 18,958 (14,899 ) (78.59 )% Gains (losses) from investments in securities 2,434 (4,604 ) 7,038 152.87 % Other Expenses: Interest expense 322,833 295,322 27,511 9.32 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 510 510 100.00 % Net derivative loss 17,021 (17,021 ) (100.00 )% Income from continuing operations 262,739 97,383 165,356 169.80 % Gains on sales of real estate 11,760 33,340 (21,580 ) (64.73 )% Net income 274,499 130,723 143,776 109.99 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships (2,778 ) (1,997 ) (781 ) (39.11 )% Noncontrolling interest redeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership (3,594 ) (4,226 ) 632 14.96 % Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership (35,534 ) (14,392 ) (21,142 ) (146.90 )% Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate common units of the Operating Partnership (1,579 ) (4,838 ) 3,259 67.36 % Net Income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 231,014 $ 105,270 $ 125,744 119.45 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 56. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $30,385 and $36,872, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $23,966 and $27,510, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 67 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $2.0 million and an increase of approximately $24.3 million in straight-line rents. The increase in straight-line rent is primarily the result of us establishing in the third quarter of 2008 a $21.0 million reserve, which was reflected as a direct reduction of straight-line rent, for the full amount of the accrued straight-line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. The increases in contractual rental revenue and straight-line rent were offset by an approximately $10.4 million decrease in recoveries from tenants in 2009. Generally, under each of our leases, we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease. The decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in New York City, which resulted in lesser tenant recoveries due to decreased occupancy and, to the extent space was re-leased, leases are in their first year during which, generally, no tenant recoveries are earned. We also had an approximately $2.3 million decrease in parking and other income. Termination Income We recognized termination income totaling approximately $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was related to sixteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio that terminated their leases. Approximately $7.5 million of termination income for 2009 related to a termination agreement with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue. Approximately $3.6 million is non-cash income consisting of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases. Termination income totaling approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 was related to multiple tenants across the Same Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, including $7.5 million of termination income related to a termination agreement with Heller Ehrman LLP. Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in Same Property Portfolio real estate operating expenses is an increase in real estate taxes of approximately $18.0 million, or 9%, which was predominately due to an increase in real estate taxes in the central business districts in Boston and New York City. This was offset by overall decreases in utilities expense of approximately $7.9 million, or 9%, and other property-related expenses of approximately $7.3 million of which approximately $3.0 million relates to repairs and maintenance. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was predominately due to accelerated amortization related to tenant terminations in New York City. Properties Sold Portfolio Revenue and real estate operating expenses from the Properties Sold Portfolio decreased by approximately $0.1 million and $46,000, respectively due to the transfer of Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park to the Value-Added Fund on January 7, 2008. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for the properties and our continued ownership interest through the Value-Added Fund. 68 Table of Contents Properties Acquired Portfolio The acquisition of 635 Massachusetts Avenue on September 26, 2008 increased rental revenue, real estate operating expenses, and depreciation by approximately $5.4 million, $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio At December 31, 2009, we had seven properties totaling approximately 2.0 million square feet that were placed in-service between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009. Rental revenue from our Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio increased approximately $30.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In-Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9 th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 21,974 $ 20,090 $ 1,884 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 27,280 20,010 7,270 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 8,961 2,098 6,863 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,516 1,085 431 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 7,753 7,753 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 4,738 4,738 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 1,051 1,051 Total $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ 29,990 Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio increased approximately $10.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In-Service Real Estate Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9 th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 6,929 $ 5,672 $ 1,257 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 7,057 3,466 3,591 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 2,477 883 1,594 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,257 517 740 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 1,777 1,777 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 751 751 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 294 294 Total $ 20,542 $ 10,538 $ 10,004 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In-Service Portfolio increased by approximately $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property decreased approximately $2.9 million, a 31.4% decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008. 69 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 Percentage Change Occupancy 75.1 % 77.7 % (3.3 )% Average daily rate $ 185.29 $ 217.70 (14.9 )% Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 139.19 $ 169.08 (17.7 )% Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Development fees increased by approximately $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to development fees of approximately $6.1 million for our 20 F Street and 1111 North Capitol Street third-party development projects. This increase was offset by a decrease in other development fees of approximately $1.5 million, of which approximately $0.5 million is related to the completion and placing in-service of our Annapolis Junction joint venture development project. Management fees decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the net effect of an approximately $1.0 million increase in management fee income offset by a decrease of approximately $1.2 million in service income of which approximately $1.0 million is attributable to a decrease in work orders and overtime usage of HVAC in New York City. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was the net result of an approximately $8.5 million increase in payroll expense, offset by a decrease in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and a decrease of approximately $2.3 million related to abandoned projects in 2008. Approximately $5.6 million of the payroll expenses increase was related to an increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and approximately $3.1 million was related to the amortization associated with restricted stock equity awards. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These 2008 OPP Awards were part of a broad-based long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilized TRS over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards were eligible to share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards could earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, was subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although only OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million were granted. Under guidance included in ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation (formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment ) the 2008 OPP Awards had an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which was generally being amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period (although awards for retirement-eligible employees will be amortized over a three-year period). Because the 2008 OPP Units required us to outperform absolute and relative return thresholds, unless such thresholds were met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we excluded the 2008 OPP Units from the diluted EPS calculation. The 2008 OPP Awards were not earned, and therefore the program was terminated, which resulted in the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense during the first quarter of 2011. See Notes 15, 17 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $11.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Loss from Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot project at 250 West 55 th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of other income during the year ended December 31, 2010. Between April 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of additional costs associated with the suspension of development. Other Income and Expense Items Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures During December 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment charges which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with guidance in ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures ( ASC 323 ) (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55 th Street and the Value-Added Fund, respectively. In addition, in June 2009 and December 2009, we recognized additional non-cash impairment charges on our investment in the Value-Added Fund of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorates further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. In addition, during December 2009, our Value-Added Fund recognized a non-cash impairment charge in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144) related to our One and Two Circle Star Way properties in San Carlos, California totaling approximately $24.6 million, of which our share was approximately $4.2 million, which amount reflects the reduction in our basis of approximately $2.0 million from previous impairment losses. The Value-Added Fund was in discussions with the lender to modify the loan and as a result believed that the carrying value of the properties was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Value-Added Fund recognized the non-cash impairment charge to reduce the net book value of the properties to their estimated fair market value at December 31, 2009. On October 21, 2010, our Value-Added Fund conveyed the fee simple title to its One and Two Circle Star Way properties and paid $3.8 million to the lender in satisfaction of its outstanding obligations under the existing mortgage loan and guarantee. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air-rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air-rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a 71 Table of Contents charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non-cash impairment charges in accordance with guidance in ASC 323), which represented our share of land and air-rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre-development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55 th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. These acquisitions increased our income from unconsolidated joint ventures by approximately $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased approximately $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were approximately $602.6 million and $447.1 million, respectively. However, the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 decreased by approximately 1.70%. Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan. In December 2007, the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in-kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $0.2 million and ($1.4) million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund. The remainder of the gains (losses) from investments in securities in 2009 and 2008 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gain (loss) from investments in securities. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we recognized gains (losses) of $2.2 million and $(3.2) million on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by $2.4 million and $(3.2) million during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a result of increases and decreases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. 72 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 as detailed below Component Change in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 (in thousands) Increases to interest expense due to: New mortgages / properties placed in-service $ 22,664 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $747.5 million in aggregate principal of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014 on August 19, 2008 (excluding the ASC 470-20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) interest expense) 17,736 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 on October 9, 2009 9,376 ASC 470-20 interest expense 10,888 Total increases to interest expense $ 60,664 Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgages $ (22,308 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (2,530 ) Reduction in borrowings under our Operating Partnership Unsecured Line of Credit (4,852 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes and exchangeable senior notes) (3,463 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (33,153 ) Total change in interest expense $ 27,511 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgages line item: Reston Corporate Center, Prudential Center, One and Two Embarcadero Center, Bedford Business Park, Reservoir Place, Ten Cambridge Center and 1301 New York Avenue. The following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in-service line item: Four Embarcadero Center, South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Office and Reservoir Place. As properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $48.8 million and $46.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. At December 31, 2009, our variable rate debt consisted of construction loans at our South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Place Office and Atlantic Wharf construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit and our secured financing at Reservoir Place. 73 Table of Contents The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008: December 31, 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 6,326,350 $ 5,707,392 Variable rate 393,421 385,492 Total $ 6,719,771 $ 6,092,884 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 94.15 % 93.67 % Variable rate 5.85 % 6.33 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.12 % 6.15 % Variable rate 1.98 % 3.62 % Total 5.87 % 5.99 % Coupon/Stated weighted-average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.43 % 5.43 % Variable rate 1.75 % 3.07 % Total 5.21 % 5.28 % Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all-in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight-year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten-year term and, as a result, under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ), during the third quarter of 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with guidance included in ASC 815 (formerly known as SFAS No. 133) as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the 74 Table of Contents required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. Gains on Sales of Real Estate Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the sale of 280 Park Avenue in New York City in 2006, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten-year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $23.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we signed no new qualifying leases and our remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million. On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million was deferred and is being recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 of approximately $11.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9 th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in allocable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 75 Table of Contents We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short-term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed. However, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project size and duration and our access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(2) Represents office and retail percentage leased as of February 18, 2011 and excludes residential space. (3) On October 1, 2010, we modified the construction facility by releasing from collateral the residential component and ground floor retail included in the Russia Building and reducing the loan commitment from $215.0 million to $192.5 million. We have not drawn any amounts under this facility but we reserve the right to do so in the future. (4) Project includes 17,000 square feet of retail space. (5) Project includes 20,000 square feet of retail space and is subject to a ground lease which expires in 2068.

Estimated total investment is net of $12.0 million of anticipated net proceeds from the sale of Federal historic tax credits. (8) Project costs includes residential and retail components and is subject to a ground lease expiring in 2068. 76 Table of Contents Contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our Operating Partnership Unsecured Line of Credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses. We believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Operating Partnership Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. Given the recent low interest rate environment and the opportunity to further enhance our capital position and elongate our debt maturity schedule, we have also been active in the capital markets. Since January 1, 2010, five of our joint ventures have refinanced approximately $714 million in secured financings. In April 2010, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $694 million, and in November 2010, we completed a public offering of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $837 million. We used the proceeds of the November offering to reduce a significant portion of our near-term debt maturities. Specifically, we redeemed $700 million of our 6.25% senior notes due 2013 and we repurchased $50 million of our 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 that the holders may require us to repurchase in February 2012. Our remaining liquidity as of February 18, 2011, including available cash of approximately $327 million and full availability under our Operating Partnership $1.0 billion line of credit, is expected to provide sufficient capacity to fund the completion of our development pipeline and provide capital for future investments. Our most significant capital commitments in 2011 are to fund our development program and repay or refinance expiring debt. We believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital. In 2010, our Operating Partnership exercised its option to extend the maturity date under its $1.0 billion Unsecured Line of Credit to August 3, 2011 and we are currently in discussions on a longer term renewal. We are evaluating refinancing alternatives on our $457 million mortgage loan on 601 Lexington Avenue and we believe we could raise approximately $700 million to $750 million through a new secured mortgage loan. Our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio has three loans maturing in 2011, Mountain View Research Park, Annapolis Junction and Mountain View Technology Park which have balances of approximately $112 million, $43 million and $24 million, respectively (of which our share is $44 million, $22 million and $9 million, respectively). In addition to our Operating Partnership Unsecured Line of Credit and property-specific debt, as of February 18, 2011, our Operating Partnership also had approximately $4.8 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (including approximately $1.8 billion of exchangeable senior notes). All of this debt either matures or is subject to repurchase at the holders option between 2012 and 2021. We are focused on our near and medium-term debt maturities and, to date, our Operating Partnership has repurchased approximately $236.3 million of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, which the holders may require us to repurchase in 2012, for approximately $236.6 million, and have redeemed $700 million of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013 for approximately $793.1 million, which included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase unsecured senior notes and unsecured 77 Table of Contents exchangeable senior notes for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or both. We will evaluate any such potential transactions in light of then-existing market conditions, taking into account the trading prices of the notes, our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. During the first quarter of 2011 through February 25, 2011, we issued 2,304,994 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $219.0 million. These shares were issued under our $400 million at the market equity offering program. We intend to use the net proceeds from these issuances for general business purposes, which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction. Future potential sales under the program will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, our capital needs and our determinations as to the appropriate sources of funding for our activities. In total, our remaining capital requirements, net of anticipated and potential funding from existing construction loans, to complete our ongoing developments and Weston Corporate Center is approximately $87.8 million, through late 2012. We are working towards the commencement of two new developments and two redevelopments in the Washington, DC market in 2011. With available cash, access to our Operating Partnership Unsecured Line of Credit and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio, we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements and pursue attractive investment opportunities. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend As a REIT we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. With a view toward increasing our equity over time and preserving additional capital, we reduced our quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2009 to $0.50 per common share. Based on our current expectation for taxable income for 2011, and absent any unanticipated circumstances, we expect that our quarterly dividend will be approximately $0.50 per common share. There can be no assurance that the actual dividends declared by our Board of Directors will not differ materially. Sales We structured the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower as a reverse like-kind exchange, which is intended to provide us the flexibility to sell certain assets within 180 days of the closing, defer any taxable gain and thereby retain capital for future investments or the reduction of debt. We are currently evaluating market interest in a sale of all or a significant interest in our Carnegie Center portfolio and may identify other assets for potential sale in 2011. To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 78 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, representing a decrease of $0.9 billion. The decrease was a result of the following changes in cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 375,893 $ 617,376 $ (241,483 ) Net cash (used in) investing activities $ (1,161,274 ) $ (446,601 ) $ (714,673 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (184,604 ) $ 1,036,648 $ (1,221,252 ) Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.1 years with portfolio occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 95%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly distribution payment requirements. Items which contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 were (1) the payment of the redemption premium of approximately $75.2 million and the payment of an aggregate of approximately $20.0 million of accrued interest and hedge settlement costs in connection with the redemption of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Operating Partnership 6.25% senior notes due 2013, (2) a net increase in the cash payments of interest expense of approximately $59.5 million, (3) the payment of approximately $17.6 million related to the payment of the accreted debt discount on the repurchase of our Operating Partnership 2.875% exchangeable senior notes, (4) an increase in cash payments of approximately $13.2 million related to tenant leasing costs and (5) the payment of approximately $12.8 million related to the termination of a lease agreement at our 250 West 55 th Street project. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in building acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of funding our development projects, the acquisition of the John Hancock Building, our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns 125 West 55th Street to repay the joint venture outstanding mezzanine loans and the proceeds from a mortgage loan being placed in escrow, and is detailed below: (in thousands) Acquisitions/additions to real estate $ (850,519 ) Proceeds from redemptions of investments in securities 2,149 Capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures (62,806 ) Capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures 49,902 Proceeds from mortgage loan placed in escrow (267,500 ) Deposits on real estate (10,000 ) Acquisition of note receivable (22,500 ) Net cash (used in) investing activities $ (1,161,274 ) Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 totaled approximately $184.6 million. This consisted primarily of the redemption of a portion of our Operating Partnership 6.25% senior notes due 2013, payments of dividends and distributions to our shareholders and the unitholders of our Operating Partnership, the repurchase of a portion of our Operating Partnership 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 and the repayment of mortgage notes payable, partially offset by the net proceeds from the offerings in April and November 2010 of our Operating Partnership 5.625% and 4.125% senior notes due 2020 and 2021, respectively, and the proceeds from mortgage notes payable. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Capitalization-Debt Financing . 79 Table of Contents Capitalization At December 31, 2010, our total consolidated debt was approximately $7.8 billion. The GAAP weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 5.56% per annum and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.4 years. Consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total consolidated market capitalization was approximately $21.8 billion at December 31, 2010. Total consolidated market capitalization was calculated using the December 31, 2010 closing stock price of $86.10 per common share and the following: (1) 140,199,105 shares of our common stock, (2) 19,387,781 outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 1,460,688 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding Series Two Preferred Units of partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership, (4) an aggregate of 1,507,164 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $7.8 billion. The calculation of total consolidated market capitalization does not include 1,080,938 2008 OPP Units because, unlike other LTIP Units, they are not earned until certain return thresholds are achieved. Our total consolidated debt, which excludes debt collateralized by our unconsolidated joint ventures, at December 31, 2010 represented approximately 35.75% of our total consolidated market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the consolidated debt to total consolidated market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness. For a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness. 80 Table of Contents Debt Financing As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $7.8 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 35.75% of our total consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $3.017 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes (excluding exchangeable senior notes) having a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38% per annum and maturities in 2013, 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2021; (2) $428.1 million (net of adjustment for the equity component allocation) of exchangeable senior notes having a GAAP interest rate of 5.958% per annum (an effective rate of 3.787% per annum, excluding the effect of the adjustment for the equity component allocation), an initial optional redemption date in 2013 and maturity in 2036; (3) $607.5 million (net of discount and adjustment for the equity component allocation) of exchangeable senior notes having a GAAP interest rate of 5.630% per annum (an effective rate of 3.462% per annum, excluding the effect of the adjustment for the equity component allocation), an initial optional redemption date in 2012 and maturing in 2037; (4) $686.1 million (net of discount and the adjustment for the equity component allocation ) of exchangeable senior notes having a GAAP interest rate of 6.555% per annum (an effective rate of 4.037%, excluding the effect of the adjustment for the equity component allocation) and maturing in 2014; (5) $267.5 million of debt fully secured by cash deposits having a GAAP interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.30% per annum and maturing February 24, 2012 and (6) $2.8 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 5.90% per annum and weighted-average term of 4.9 years. The table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable, our unsecured senior notes and our Unsecured Line of Credit at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009: December 31, 2010 2009 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate mortgage notes payable $ 2,730,086 $ 2,249,880 Variable rate mortgage notes payable 317,500 393,421 Unsecured senior notes, net of discount 3,016,598 2,172,389 Unsecured exchangeable senior notes, net of discount and adjustment for the equity component allocation 1,721,817 1,904,081 Unsecured Line of Credit Total $ 7,786,001 $ 6,719,771 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 95.92 % 94.15 % Variable rate 4.08 % 5.85 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.75 % 6.12 % Variable rate 0.99 % 1.98 % Total 5.56 % 5.87 % Coupon/Stated weighted-average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.25 % 5.43 % Variable rate 0.86 % 1.75 % Total 5.07 % 5.21 % The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 0.60% per annum. 81 Table of Contents Unsecured Line of Credit The lenders total commitment under our Operating Partnership Unsecured Line of Credit is $1.0 billion. The Unsecured Line of Credit bears interest at a variable interest rate equal to Eurodollar plus 0.475% per annum. Effective as of August 3, 2010, the maturity date was extended to August 3, 2011. All other terms of the Unsecured Line of Credit remain unchanged. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or replace the Unsecured Line of Credit upon maturity on favorable terms (including the lenders total commitment) or at all. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of our Operating Partnership. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 0.125% per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in our Operating Partnership unsecured debt ratings. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to our Operating Partnership at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. Our ability to borrow under our Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%; a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40; an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a minimum net worth requirement; an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and limitations on permitted investments. We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above. As of December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings and letters of credit totaling $24.6 million outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit, with the ability to borrow $975.4 million. As of February 18, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit.

(2) No principal amounts are due prior to maturity. 82 Table of Contents On April 19, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% senior notes due 2020. The notes were priced at 99.891% of the principal amount to yield 5.708% to maturity. The aggregate net proceeds to our Operating Partnership, after deducting underwriter discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $693.5 million. The notes mature on November 15, 2020, unless earlier redeemed. On April 7, 2010, in connection with the offering, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the 10-year U.S Treasury rate (which was used as a reference security in pricing) at 3.873% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $350.0 million. We subsequently cash-settled the treasury lock agreements and received approximately $0.4 million, which amount will be recognized as a reduction to our interest expense over the term of the notes. On November 18, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.125% senior notes due 2021. The notes were priced at 99.26% of the principal amount to yield 4.289% to maturity. The aggregate net proceeds to our Operating Partnership, after deducting underwriter discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $836.9 million. The notes mature on May 15, 2021, unless earlier redeemed. On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash-settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write-off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis points in the case of the $250 million of notes that mature on June 1, 2015, 40 basis points in the case of the $700 million of notes that mature on October 15, 2019, and 30 basis points in the case of the $700 million and $850 million of notes that mature on November 15, 2020 and May 15, 2021, respectively), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indentures under which our unsecured senior notes were issued contain restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.50, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2010, we believe we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. 83 Table of Contents Unsecured Exchangeable Senior Notes The following summarizes the unsecured exchangeable senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Coupon/ Stated Rate Effective Rate(1) Exchange Rate Principal Amount First Optional Redemption Date by BPLP Maturity Date 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes 3.625 % 4.037 % 8.5051 (2) $ 747,500 N/A February 15, 2014 2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes 2.875 % 3.462 % 7.0430 (3) 626,194 February 20, 2012(4) February 15, 2037 3.750% Exchangeable Senior Notes 3.750 % 3.787 % 10.0066 (5) 450,000 May 18, 2013(6) May 15, 2036 Total principal 1,823,694 Net discount (8,249 ) Adjustment for the equity component allocation, net of accumulated amortization (93,628 ) Total $ 1,721,817 (1) Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes but excluding the effects of the adjustment for the equity component allocation. (2) The initial exchange rate is 8.5051 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (or an initial exchange price of approximately $117.58 per share of our common stock). In addition, we entered into capped call transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers, which are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future exchange of the notes. The capped call transactions are expected to have the effect of increasing the effective exchange price to us of the notes from $117.58 to approximately $137.17 per share, representing an overall effective premium of approximately 40% over the closing price on August 13, 2008 of $97.98 per share of our common stock. The net cost of the capped call transactions was approximately $44.4 million. As of December 31, 2010, the effective exchange price was $135.85 per share. (3) In connection with the special dividend of $5.98 per share of common stock declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 6.6090 to 7.0430 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $141.98 per share of our common stock. (4) Holders may require our Operating Partnership to repurchase the notes for cash on February 15, 2012, 2017, 2022, 2027 and 2032 and at any time prior to their maturity upon a fundamental change, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. (5) In connection with the special dividend of $5.98 per share of common stock declared on December 17, 2007, the exchange rate was adjusted from 9.3900 to 10.0066 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes effective as of December 31, 2007, resulting in an exchange price of approximately $99.93 per share of our common stock. (6) Holders may require our Operating Partnership to repurchase the notes for cash on May 18, 2013 and May 15, 2016, 2021, 2026 and 2031 and at any time prior to their maturity upon a fundamental change, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, which the holders may require our Operating Partnership to repurchase in February 2012, for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. There remains an aggregate of approximately $626.2 million of these notes outstanding. 84 Table of Contents Mortgage Debt The following represents the outstanding principal balances due under the mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2010: Properties Stated Interest Rate GAAP Interest Rate(1) Stated Principal Amount Historical Fair Value Adjustment Carrying Amount Maturity Date (Dollars in thousands) 599 Lexington Avenue 5.57 % 5.41 % $ 750,000 $ $ 750,000 (2)(3) March 1, 2017 John Hancock Tower 5.68 % 5.05 % 640,500 22,826 663,326 (1)(3) January 6, 2017 601 Lexington Avenue 7.19 % 7.24 % 456,633 265 456,898 (1) May 11, 2011 Embarcadero Center Four 6.10 % 7.02 % 374,634 374,634 (4) December 1, 2016 510 Madison Avenue 0.56 % 0.64 % 267,500 267,500 (3)(5) February 24, 2012 505 9 th Street 5.73 % 5.87 % 127,901 127,901 (6) November 1, 2017 One Freedom Square 7.75 % 5.34 % 67,031 1,721 68,752 (1)(7) June 30, 2012 New Dominion Tech Park, Bldg.

All adjustments to reflect loans at their fair value upon acquisition are noted above. (2) On December 19, 2006, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts related to this financing and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense for this mortgage over the term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.41% per annum for the financing. The stated interest rate is 5.57% per annum. The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (3) The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (4) On November 13, 2008, we closed on an eight-year, $375.0 million mortgage loan collateralized by this property. The mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.10% per annum. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight-year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss resulting in an effective interest rate of 7.02% per annum. (5) The mortgage financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.30% per annum and is fully secured by cash deposits. (6) This property is owned by a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest. (7) We have agreed to guarantee approximately $7.9 million related to our obligation to provide funds for certain tenant re-leasing costs. (8) The mortgage financing currently bears interest at a variable rate equal to Eurodollar plus 2.20% per annum. (9) On several occasions in late 2010 and early 2011, we notified the master servicer of the non-recourse mortgage loan collateralized by our Montvale Center property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland, that the cash flows generated from the property were insufficient to fund debt service payments and capital improvements necessary to lease and operate the property and that we were not prepared to fund any cash shortfalls. Accordingly, we requested that the loan be placed with the special servicer. We have ceased making debt service payments and are currently in default. We are in discussions with the master servicer, but there can be no assurance as to the timing and ultimate resolution of these discussions. (10) We have not drawn any amounts under this construction loan facility. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum and matures on April 21, 2012 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. On October 1, 2010, we modified the construction loan facility by releasing from collateral the residential component and ground floor retail included in the Russia Building and reducing the loan commitment from $215.0 million to $192.5 million. 85 Table of Contents Contractual aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2010 are as follows: Year Principal Payments (in thousands) 2011 $ 471,818 2012 372,929 2013 101,289 2014 125,264 2015 14,312 Thereafter 1,934,278 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 96% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy mitigates us against future increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, our outstanding variable rate debt based on LIBOR totaled approximately $317.5 million. At December 31, 2010, the interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 0.99% per annum. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010 our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on all of our fixed and variable rate debt was 5.25% and 0.86%, respectively. The weighted-average coupon/stated rate for our senior notes and unsecured exchangeable debt was 5.30% and 3.67%, respectively. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT 86 Table of Contents definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 87.25%, 86.57%, 85.49%, 85.32% and 84.40% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, after allocation to the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate. Losses from early extinguishments of debt result when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that adjusting FFO to exclude these losses more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions. Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Neither FFO, nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and neither of these measures is a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted, should be compared with our reported net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 87 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 159,072 $ 231,014 $ 105,270 $ 1,310,106 $ 870,291 Add: Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate common units of the Operating Partnership 349 1,579 4,838 140,547 113,432 Noncontrolling interest in discontinued operations common units of the Operating Partnership 40,237 2,977 Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership 24,099 35,534 14,392 51,978 46,568 Noncontrolling interest redeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership 3,343 3,594 4,226 10,429 22,814 Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships 3,464 2,778 1,997 84 (2,013 ) Less: Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations 259,519 Income from discontinued operations 7,274 19,081 Gains on sales of real estate 2,734 11,760 33,340 929,785 719,826 Income from continuing operations 187,593 262,739 97,383 356,803 315,162 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization(1) 450,546 446,718 382,600 295,635 283,350 Income from discontinued operations 7,274 19,081 Less: Gains on sales of real estate included within income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures(2) 572 15,453 17,917 Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships share of Funds from Operations 6,862 5,513 3,949 437 479 Noncontrolling interest redeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership(3) 3,343 3,594 3,738 4,266 9,418 Funds from Operations attributable to the Operating Partnership 627,362 700,350 472,296 639,556 589,779 Less: Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership share of Funds from Operations 80,006 94,078 68,508 93,906 91,997 Funds from Operations attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 547,356 $ 606,272 $ 403,788 $ 545,650 $ 497,782 Add: Losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 2,675 31,444 Less: Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership share of losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 392 4,905 Funds from Operations attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. after supplemental adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate $ 547,356 $ 606,272 $ 403,788 $ 547,933 $ 524,321 Our percentage share of Funds from Operations basic 87.25 % 86.57 % 85.49 % 85.32 % 84.40 % Weighted average shares outstanding basic 139,440 131,050 119,980 118,839 114,721 (1) Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $338,371, $321,681, $304,147, $286,030 and $270,562, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $113,945, $126,943, $80,303, $8,247 and $9,087, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $0, $0, $0, $2,948 and $6,197, less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,770, $1,906, $1,850, $1,590 and $1,584 and adjustment of asset retirement obligations of $0, $0, $0, $0 and $912 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(2) Our share of diluted Funds from Operations was 87.41%, 86.74%, 85.78%, 85.69% and 85.06% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 89 Table of Contents Net Operating Income Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses (gains) from investments in securities, net derivative losses, loss (gain) from suspension of development, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, acquisitions costs and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, income from discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. NOI excludes certain components from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to our properties results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. 90 Table of Contents The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. for the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.

The interest rate as of December 31, 2010 was used to calculate the interest that will be paid on our variable rate debt. (2) Amounts are included in the year in which the first optional redemption date occurs (or, in the case of the exchangeable notes due 2014, the year of maturity). (3) Committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of December 31, 2010 (tenant improvements and lease commissions). We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. 92 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness We have investments in twelve unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 25% to 60%. Ten of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $3.2 billion. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2010. In addition to other guarantees specifically noted in the table, we have agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of the loans.

All adjustments to reflect loans at their fair value upon acquisition are noted above. (2) The loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (3) In connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint venture obligation to fund various escrows, including tenant improvements, taxes and insurance in lieu of cash deposits. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $24.0 million. We earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with our partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. (4) Principal amount does not include the assumed mezzanine loan with an aggregate principal amount of $294.0 million and a stated rate of 6.02% per annum, as the venture acquired the lenders interest in this loan for a purchase price of approximately $263.1 million in cash. (5) In connection with the capitalization of the joint venture, loans in an aggregate amount of $450.0 million were funded by the venture partners on a pro-rata basis. Our share of the partner loans totaling $270.0 million has been reflected in Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (6) In connection with the refinancing of this property secured loan by the joint venture, we have guaranteed the joint venture obligation to fund an escrow related to certain lease rollover costs in lieu of an initial cash deposit for the full amount. The maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was $21.3 million. At closing, the joint venture funded a $10.0 million cash deposit into an escrow account and the remaining $11.3 million will be further reduced with scheduled monthly deposits from operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2010, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $7.2 million. We earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with the outside partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. (7) In connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint venture obligation to fund tenant improvements and leasing commissions. (8) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum and matures on September 12, 2011 and includes an additional one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions. In addition, we have guaranteed the repayment of approximately $9.1 million of principal (as well as interest on the loan), which amount is subject to reduction and eventual elimination upon attaining certain debt service coverage ratios. (9) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. (10) Mortgage financing totals $26.0 million (of which approximately $24.5 million has been disbursed as of December 31, 2010). The mortgage bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.50% and matures on March 31, 2011 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. We do not currently expect to satisfy the conditions for extending the maturity date. The Value-Added Fund has entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 4.085% per annum on a notional amount of $24 million. The swap contract went into effect on June 12, 2008 and expires on March 31, 2011. 93 Table of Contents (11) Mortgage financing totals $120.0 million (of which $103.0 million was drawn at closing, $9.0 million was drawn to fund tenant and capital costs, with the remaining $8.0 million available to fund future tenant and capital costs). The mortgage bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.75% and matures on May 31, 2011 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. We do not currently expect to satisfy the conditions for extending the maturity date. The Value-Added Fund has guaranteed the payment of interest on the loan. The Value-Added Fund has entered into three interest rate swap contracts to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 3.63% per annum on an aggregate notional amount of $103 million. The swap contracts went into effect on June 2, 2008 and expire on April 1, 2011. (12) Mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of (1) the prime rate, as defined in the loan agreement, or (2) 5.75% per annum. Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of 94 Table of Contents certain contaminants. We have developed an office park on this Property. Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. Reclassifications and Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been revised as a result of the adoption on January 1, 2009 of (1) ASC 470-20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14-1) (See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) the guidance included in ASC 810 Consolidation (formerly known as SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 )) and ASC 480-10-S99 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (formerly known as EITF Topic No. D-98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities (Amended)) (See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (3) the guidance included in ASC 260-10 Earnings Per Share (formerly known as FSP EITF 03-06-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities ) (See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations. 95 Table of Contents
