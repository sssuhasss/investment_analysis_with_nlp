ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets. We operate in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis, specialty polymers and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. 2006 Highlights 2006 was a year during which we experienced continued sales growth in all of our business segments. We also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax. Our liquidity position continued to improve primarily due to growth in cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, we have continued to reduce our debt level which has lowered our net interest expense. In February 2006, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of the Company common stock. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $90 million. Consolidated revenue of $2,347.0 million was up 9 percent from the prior year. Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals had revenue increases of 6%, 6% and 14%, respectively. In Agricultural Products, our focused strategy combined with strong sales growth in South America, particularly Brazil, as well as higher sales in North America and Asia and for herbicides, led to the increase in revenue. Specialty Chemical increases were driven by higher volumes and selling prices of primary lithium compounds and in the pharmaceutical market in BioPolymer. Industrial Chemicals continued to benefit from volume growth and higher selling prices in soda ash and higher selling prices for North American hydrogen peroxide. Income from continuing operations before income tax of $213.5 million was up significantly from the prior year. This was driven primarily by 21%, 10% and 15% increases in operating profit in Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals, respectively, and lower interest expense levels. Net interest expense of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased by $25.2 million, or 43%, from the prior year primarily as a result of reduced debt levels. Partially offsetting these increases in operating profit were significantly higher energy and raw material costs and the absence of profits from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005. 2007 Outlook In 2007, we expect continued growth in our revenue and earnings. The increase in revenue is expected to be driven by higher selling prices for soda ash, higher volumes and selling prices in BioPolymer and lithium, volume growth in Foret and new product introductions in Agricultural Products. The increase in earnings is expected to be driven by new product introductions and further supply chain productivity improvements in Agricultural Products and continued sales growth and productivity improvements in Specialty Chemicals. Higher energy costs, particularly in Spain, higher raw material costs, and increased spending on our growth initiatives are expected to partially offset our profit growth. We expect cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental obligations We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the EPA, or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a ROD, or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a RI/FS that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. We believe that it is reasonably possible that loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $75 million at December 31, 2006. Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2006 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies, and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2006. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named PRPs or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by CERCLA and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid 29 Table of Contents before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued or as Other Assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2006 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We recorded $15.1 million, $10.6 million and $9.2 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 we adopted a new pension accounting standard (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements) which required us to recognize in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 the total underfunded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans. The underfunded status is defined as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation. At December 31, 2006, our net underfunded status recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was $140.2 million. We made voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of $30.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, for 2006 and 2005. In addition, we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of $2.7 30 Table of Contents million and $2.5 million, for 2006 and 2005, respectively. We paid other postretirement benefits, net of participant contributions, of $5.0 million and $7.0 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our estimated cash contributions for 2007 include approximately $2.4 million in nonqualified pension benefits, $4.7 million in other postretirement benefits, and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $30 million. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds, including Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) Aa-rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices. In selecting the discount rate for 2006, we placed particular emphasis on a yield-curve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows. The specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns (yields) from a portfolio of high-quality (Aa-graded or higher) bond investments constructed by our actuary. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on long-term real return expectations by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 12 percent over the last 10 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. The current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 79 percent equities (U.S. and non-U.S.), 18 percent fixed-income and 3 percent cash and other short-term investments. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 3 percent, is between 9 percent and 11 percent for both U.S. and non-U.S. equities, and between 5 percent and 7 percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $53.0 million at December 31, 2006 and $50.8 million at December 31, 2005, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $5.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.5 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $57.1 million at December 31, 2006 and $56.0 million at December 31, 2005, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $5.9 million, $5.6 million and $5.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $3.6 million, $3.4 million and $3.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $3.6 million, $3.4 million and $3.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning 31 Table of Contents strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the valuation allowance was $81.5 million and $72.6 million, respectively. Results of Operations 2006, 2005 and 2004 Overview Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) (In Millions, Except Per Share Data) Consolidated Revenue $ 2,347.0 $ 2,150.2 $ 2,051.2 Net income $ 132.0 $ 3.34 $ 116.6 $ 2.97 $ 160.2 $ 4.28 Net income included the following after-tax charges (gains): Restructuring and other charges $ 57.9 $ 1.46 $ 26.1 $ 0.67 $ 2.2 $ 0.06 In-process research and development 1.2 0.03 Astaris restructuring (1) (0.2 ) (0.01 ) 7.0 0.18 Investment gains (2) (24.1 ) (0.61 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 37.4 0.96 6.0 0.16 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 0.5 0.01 Discontinued operations 12.8 0.33 (6.1 ) (0.15 ) 15.4 0.42 Tax adjustments 12.5 0.32 21.7 0.55 (71.0 ) (1.90 ) After-tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges (3) $ 216.4 $ 5.48 $ 171.9 $ 4.39 $ 119.8 $ 3.20 (1) Our share of charges recorded by Astaris, the phosphorous joint venture prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income. Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 represents adjustments to liabilities related to restructuring and other charges recorded by Astaris prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets. (2) Investment gains include a gain in connection with Astaris sale of substantially all of its assets. This gain is included in equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income. (3) We believe that the Non-GAAP financial measure After-tax income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other income and charges, and its presentation on a per-share basis, provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The after-tax charges (gains) included in net income presented in the chart above can be found in the results of operations discussions below for 2006 compared to 2005 and for 2005 compared to 2004. See Segment Results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2006, 2005 and 2004. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2006 compared to 2005 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ending December 31, 2006 and prior year refers to the year ending December 31, 2005. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our consolidated statements of income included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K as well as the after-tax charges included in net income in the above table. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2,347.0 million, an increase of 9 percent compared to the $2,150.2 million recorded in the prior year period. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments, which are discussed separately below. In-Process Research and Development for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2.0 million ($1.2 million after tax). Our Agricultural Products segment entered into development agreements with a third-party company whereby we were given the right to develop further one of such party products in certain geographic markets. Restructuring and other charges were $74.8 million ($57.9 million after-tax) in 2006 compared to $40.4 million ($26.1 million after-tax) in 2005. Charges for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily include the following: We reached an agreement to settle a federal class action lawsuit, as well as other individual claims, alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose ( MCC ) product in our Specialty Chemicals business in the amount of $25.7 million. We committed to the abandonment of a plant building in our Agricultural Products segment and recorded a charge of $6.0 million. The European Commission imposed a fine on us regarding alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1997-1999 which we have appealed. This fine is associated with our Industrial Chemicals segment. We have recorded a 25 million (U.S. $30 million) charge for this fine. Since we are not required to make the payment during the appeal process, which is expected to extend beyond one year, the liability has been classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006. We announced a plan to redeploy our discovery research and development resources within our Agricultural Products segment to shorten the innovation cycle and accelerate the delivery of new product and technologies. We incurred $3.4 million of severance charges as a result of this decision. These severance costs related to approximately 70 people who have separated from us. We also abandoned assets as a result of these decisions and recorded a charge of $1.9 million. Additional restructuring charges for 2006 totaled $7.8 million. These charge included $1.2 million of asset abandonment charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.3 million of severance costs were recorded in our Specialty Chemicals segment due to a workforce restructuring. We also recorded $5.4 million relating to continuing environmental sites. Offsetting these charges was a gain of $0.6 million in our Specialty Chemicals segment from the completion of the sale of our previously disclosed assets held for sale related to our Copenhagen, Denmark carrageenan plant which we closed in 2005. The gain represented the difference between the asset held for sale balance and the final proceeds. The final proceeds from the sale totaled $9.6 million. Additional restructuring and other charges were recorded in Industrial Chemicals for $0.5 million. The charges of $40.4 million that we recorded in 2005 were primarily a result of the following: $17.0 million related to our decision to close our Copenhagen, Denmark carrageenan plant and Bezons, France blending facility in our Specialty Chemicals segment. This amount consisted of (i) plant and equipment impairment charges of $13.8 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $2.4 million and (iii) other costs of $0.8 million. 33 Table of Contents Impairment and shutdown charges of $7.5 million on our Spring Hill, West Virginia peroxygen plant. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed an analysis of our idled Spring Hill, West Virginia facility in our Industrial Chemicals segment. As a result, we committed to the abandonment of the majority of the assets at this facility before the end of their previously estimated useful life. As a result we recorded an impairment charge of $4.5 million associated with these assets and $3.0 million of charges related to the asset retirement obligations associated with this site which were triggered as a result of our abandonment plans. Additional restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $15.9 million. This amount primarily related to charges of $6.1 million at our Pocatello site to increase reserves for demolition and other shutdown costs as well as charges of $5.4 million for the abandonment of assets in our Agricultural Products segment and severance charges which were recorded in our Specialty Chemicals ($1.6 million) and Agricultural Products ($1.8 million) segments. The severance charges related to approximately 20 and 60 people, respectively. Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates was $2.3 million of earnings in 2006 versus $70.6 million of earnings in the prior year. The significant decrease was primarily the result of our sale of Astaris and substantially all of its assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. We recorded a gain from this sale of $57.7 million ($21.7 million after-tax). The decrease is also the result of income at Astaris up to the date of the asset sale in 2005. Investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2005 were due to the sale of our 50% equity method investment in Sibelco. We recorded a gain of $9.3 million ($2.4 million after-tax) in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income. There were no gains from the sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2006. Interest expense, net decreased to $32.9 million compared to $58.1 million in 2005. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the prior year. The decreases were due to our debt refinancing in June 2005 and the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes in July 2005. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $60.5 million ($37.4 million after-tax) in 2005. In 2005, in connection with our Industrial Revenue Bond refinancing, we incurred an approximate $2.1 million loss and in connection with entering into the 2005 Credit Agreement, we wrote off approximately $1.2 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and $0.6 million of fees associated with the new agreement. Additionally, in 2005, we incurred a loss of $56.6 million associated with the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes. Provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $68.7 million in 2006 compared with expense of $82.3 million in 2005 reflecting effective tax rates of 32.2% and 42.6%, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). Offsetting this decrease is the effect on the tax provision in 2006 from having the $30 million European Commission fine that is non-deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the effect of these tax adjustments and the non-deductibility of the European Commission fine, the change from 2005 to 2006 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S., dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments. 2006 tax adjustments of $12.5 million primarily include charges associated with adjustments to deferred taxes. 2005 tax adjustments of $21.7 million primarily include charges of $31.9 million associated with repatriations, net tax benefits of $19.2 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of $9.5 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of income tax. On December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . The cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of $0.5 million in 2005 (See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). 34 Table of Contents Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $12.8 million in 2006 versus a gain of $6.1 million in 2005. The 2006 loss includes net charges of $27.3 million related to environmental issues and legal expenses related to previously discontinued operations. Discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. The charges in 2006 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites as well as to increase reserves for operating and maintenance activities. Offsetting these charges was a gain of $14.0 million from the sale of 23 acres real estate property in San Jose, California related to our former Defense business. This completed the sale of land that was formerly used by FMC defense business, which was divested in 1997. 2005 net gain includes income of $29.2 million related to a sale to the city of San Jose, California of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former Defense Systems operations. Primarily offsetting this income in 2005 was net environmental and legal charges of $23.4 million. The charges in 2005 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the EPA and the primary responsible parties at the Anniston site. Net Income increased to $132.0 million in 2006 compared with $116.6 million in 2005 primarily as a result of changes in the after-tax items included in net income described above. The change in these items was the primary driver behind the increase in net income from 2005 to 2006 as well as higher earnings from our Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense. Other Financial Data Corporate Expenses were $46.2 million in 2006 compared to $45.1 million in 2005, essentially level from one year ago. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments, pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses. Other income, net decreased to $3.0 million from $13.9 million in the prior year due to a gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in 2005 which was not repeated in 2006 as well as higher pension expense and the recognition of stock option expense in 2006. Offsetting these decreases was a gain recorded in 2006 related to a refund of previously submitted payroll taxes. Segment Results 2006 compared to 2005 Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 767.0 $ 724.5 $ 42.5 6 % Operating Profit 151.0 124.8 26.2 21 Revenue in Agricultural Products was $767.0 million, an increase of 6 percent versus the prior year, driven primarily by strong sales growth in South America, particularly in Brazil, as well as by higher sales in North America and in Asia. Segment earnings were $151.0 million, an increase of 21 percent from the year earlier, as a result of the higher sales and the favorable impact of supply chain productivity initiatives, which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition, higher raw material costs and increased spending associated with growth in innovation initiatives. 35 Table of Contents In 2007, full-year revenue growth is expected to be up, in the low to mid single digits, as a result of new product introductions and continued label expansions and volume growth in herbicides. Full-year segment earnings are expected to increase approximately 10% driven by our sales growth and further supply chain productivity improvements, offset in part by increased spending on our growth initiatives and higher raw material costs. A combination of lower commodity prices and a strengthening Brazilian Real is pressuring the cash flow of our Brazilian customers who sell into U.S. dollar priced export markets. This continues to result in slower payments from these customers and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts. In our Agricultural Products segment, several products are undergoing re-registration in the U.S. and a comparable regulatory review by EU governmental authorities. In August 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued its Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision ( IRED ) for our carbofuran insecticide. The IRED proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the United States, subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses. FMC does not agree with the scientific analysis or conclusions in the IRED. FMC intends to challenge EPA conclusions and seek to maintain carbofuran as a registered product. The IRED is not a final agency action and is therefore subject to change. It does not require FMC to stop selling carbofuran at this time. In November 2006, the EU Commission Standing Committee on Animal Health and Food Chain voted not to include our carbofuran, carbosulfan and cadusafos products on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the EU. We believe the Committee decision was based on a flawed underlying scientific review, and we have initiated litigation against the European Food Safety Authority. The Standing Committee vote is not final action and does not require FMC to stop selling these products at this time. We intend to vigorously defend all our products in the US and EU regulatory processes. Several of FMC pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2007 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration in countries around the world. We do not anticipate significant impact on FMC Agricultural Products sales in 2007 as a result of any of these agency reviews; at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of such regulatory reviews beyond 2007. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 592.8 $ 558.5 $ 34.3 6 % Operating Profit 118.8 108.1 10.7 10 Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $592.8 million, an increase of 6 percent versus the prior year, driven by higher sales of primary lithium compounds and continued strength in BioPolymer pharmaceutical business. Segment earnings of $118.8 million increased 10 percent versus the prior year. The sales gains, improved results in BioPolymer food ingredients business and the benefit of restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending for growth initiatives. In 2007, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits driven by higher volumes and higher selling prices in both lithium and BioPolymer. Full-year earnings growth of approximately 10% is expected, as a result of the sales growth and the benefit of productivity improvements, mitigated somewhat by higher energy and raw material costs. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 990.9 $ 870.4 $ 120.5 14 % Operating Profit 96.7 83.9 12.8 15 36 Table of Contents Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $990.9 million, an increase of 14 percent versus the prior year. The soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices and higher volumes. North American hydrogen peroxide also benefited from higher selling prices and energy surcharges. Segment earnings of $96.7 million increased 15 percent versus the prior year, driven by the sales gains, offset in part by higher energy costs, particularly for natural gas in Spain, higher raw material costs and the absence of earnings from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005. Prior to its divestiture, Astaris contributed approximately $11 million of income in 2005. For 2007, we expect full-year revenue growth in the mid-teens as a result of higher soda ash volumes and selling prices and volume growth in Foret. Full-year segment earnings are expected to be level to prior year, as aggregate price and volume benefits are offset by higher energy costs, particularly in Spain, and higher raw material costs. Results of Operations 2005 compared to 2004 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $2,150.2 million, an increase of 5 percent compared to the $2,051.2 million recorded in the prior year period. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments, which are discussed separately below. Restructuring and other charges were $40.4 million ($26.1 million after-tax) in 2005 compared to $3.5 million ($2.2 million after-tax) in 2004. Charges for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily related to the closing of our carrageenan plant in Copenhagen, Denmark in our Specialty Chemicals segment, a charge for the abandonment of certain assets in our Agricultural Products segment and impairment and shutdown charge at our Spring Hill, West Virginia facility in our Industrial Chemicals segment. The charges of $3.5 million that we recorded in 2004 were primarily a result of severance costs. Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals recorded $3.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of these severance costs. Severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from us in 2004. We also recorded $1.1 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites. These charges were partially offset by non-cash gains totaling $1.1 million in Industrial Chemicals and $0.1 million in Corporate. Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates was $70.6 million of earnings in 2005 versus a loss of $2.1 million in the prior year. The significant increase was primarily a result of $57.7 million ($21.7 million after-tax) of earnings recorded in 2005 as a result of a gain in connection with Astaris sale of substantially all of its assets. The increase was also a result of income at Astaris up to the date of the asset sale versus a loss at Astaris in the prior period. The 2004 loss included our portion of the Astaris 2004 restructuring charges of $11.5 million ($7.0 million after-tax). Investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2005 was due to the sale of our 50% equity method investment in Sibelco. We recorded a gain of $9.3 million ($2.4 million after-tax) in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income. Interest expense, net decreased to $58.1 million compared to $78.4 million in 2004. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year. The decreases were due to our debt refinancing in October 2004 and June 2005 and the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes in July 2005. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $60.5 million ($37.4 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $9.9 million ($6.0 million after-tax) in 2004. In 2005, in connection with our Industrial Revenue Bond refinancing, we incurred an approximate $2.1 million loss and in connection with entering into 37 Table of Contents the 2005 Credit Agreement, we wrote off approximately $1.2 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and $0.6 million of fees associated with the new agreement. Additionally, in 2005, we incurred a loss of $56.6 million associated with the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes. The 2004 loss represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 credit agreement that were written off when we refinanced it in October 2004. Provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $82.3 million in 2005 compared with a benefit of $44.5 million in 2004 reflecting effective tax rates of 42.6% and (33.9%), respectively. The change was primarily due to tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). Excluding the effect of these tax adjustments, which are discussed below, the change from 2004 to 2005 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S., dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments. 2005 tax adjustments of $21.7 million primarily includes charges of $31.9 million associated with repatriations, net tax benefits of $19.2 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of $9.5 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities. 2004 tax adjustments of $71.0 million of benefits primarily includes a tax benefit of $38.6 million from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a December 2004 pronouncement from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), a tax benefit of $31.1 million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of $1.3 million resulting from a refund received from the IRS. Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a gain of $6.1 million in 2005 versus a loss of $15.4 million in 2004. The 2005 net gain includes income of $29.2 million related to completion of sale to the city of San Jose, California of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former Defense Systems operations. Primarily offsetting this income in 2005 were net environmental and legal charges of $23.4 million. Discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. The charges in 2005 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the EPA and the primary responsible parties at the Anniston site. 2004 charges primarily include amounts totaling $11.4 million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in New Jersey and at our Middleport, New York site. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of income tax . On December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . The cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of $0.5 million (See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Net Income decreased to $116.6 million in 2005 compared with $160.2 million in 2004 primarily as a result of changes in the after-tax items included in net income described above. The change in these items was the primary driver behind the decrease in net income from 2004 to 2005. Partially offsetting the decrease in net income in 2005 was higher earnings from our Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense. Other Financial Data Corporate Expenses increased 12 percent to $45.1 million in 2005 from $40.3 million in the prior year, mostly due to higher legal expense and higher employee costs. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments, pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses. Other income, net increased to $13.9 million from $4.6 million in the prior year due to the impact of the LIFO adjustment and gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in the first half of 2005. 38 Table of Contents Segment Results 2005 compared to 2004 Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2005 2004 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 724.5 $ 703.5 $ 21.0 3 % Operating Profit 124.8 118.4 6.4 5 Revenue increased 3 percent versus the prior year, driven by stronger insecticide and herbicide sales in South America, Asia and Europe. Revenues in North America were lower compared with the prior year primarily due to the impact of generic bifenthrin competition. Segment earnings were $124.8 million, an increase of 5 percent from the year earlier, as a result of the higher sales in South America, Asia and Europe and the favorable impact of manufacturing productivity initiatives, which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition in North America and higher raw material and energy costs. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2005 2004 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 558.5 $ 538.0 $ 20.5 4 % Operating Profit 108.1 96.1 12.0 12 Revenue increased by 4 percent versus the prior year, driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in pharmaceutical, polymer and energy storage markets for lithium. Sales in BioPolymer were essentially level to a year ago as the timing of demand in the pharmaceutical and personal care markets offset increased demand in food ingredients. Segment earnings increased 12 percent versus the prior year. The strong lithium performance, improved results in the BioPolymer food ingredients business and the benefits of BioPolymer restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2005 2004 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 870.4 $ 813.7 $ 56.7 7 % Operating Profit 83.9 57.3 26.6 46 Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $870.4 million, an increase of 7 percent versus the prior year. Higher soda ash sales accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices. North American hydrogen peroxide and Foret also benefited from higher selling prices during 2005. Segment earnings of $83.9 million increased 46 percent versus the prior year, driven by higher selling prices across the group and improved earnings from Astaris, offset in part by the Granger soda ash plant startup expenses and higher raw material, energy and transportation costs. 39 Table of Contents Prior to its divestiture in November, Astaris contributed approximately $11 million of income in 2005, reflecting improved pricing, lower costs and the full-year benefit of the restructuring completed in 2004. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K Liquidity and Capital Resources Domestic Credit Agreement On June 21, 2005, we executed a new $850.0 million, five-year credit agreement (the Domestic Credit Agreement ), which provided for a $600.0 million revolving credit facility ($250.0 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit) and a $250.0 million term loan facility. The initial borrowings under the Domestic Credit Agreement, which is unsecured, were used to prepay all borrowings and terminate the previous $600.0 million senior secured credit agreement. The $250.0 million term loan under the Domestic Credit Agreement was prepaid on December 21, 2005 with proceeds from the European Credit Agreement, as described below. No further borrowings are permitted under the term loan facility. Obligations under the Domestic Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which is, at our option, either a base rate or a London InterBank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the revolving credit facility by each of Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and Standard & Poor Corporation ( S&P ). At December 31, 2006 the applicable margin on LIBOR-based loans was 0.75 percent. At December 31, 2006 if we had borrowings under our Domestic Credit agreement, then the applicable rate would have been 6.07 percent per annum. In connection with entering into the Domestic Credit Agreement, we wrote off $1.2 million of deferred financing fees associated with our previous credit agreement and $0.6 million of fees associated with the new agreement. In addition, with the prepayment in December 2005 of the term loan under the Domestic Credit Agreement, we wrote-off $0.1 million of fees associated with that facility. These fees were previously included as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. European Credit Agreement On December 16, 2005, our Dutch finance subsidiary executed a new Credit Agreement (the European Credit Agreement ) which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 220,000,000, equivalent to approximately US$260 million. Borrowings may be denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. FMC and our Dutch finance subsidiary direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the European Credit Agreement. Loans under the European Credit Agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency base rate, which for loans denominated in euros is the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, and for loans denominated in dollars is LIBOR in each case plus a margin. The applicable margin under our European Credit Agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the facility or, if the facility is not rated, to FMC by each of Moody and S&P. At December 31, 2006 the applicable margin was 0.40 percent and the applicable borrowing rate under the European Credit Agreement was 4.12 percent per annum. Among other restrictions, the Domestic Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement contain financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings). We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2006. 10.25 percent Senior Notes Redemption On July 21, 2005, using proceeds of borrowings under the Domestic Credit Agreement and cash on hand, we redeemed all of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes due 2009 outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of 40 Table of Contents $355.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes and the related indenture, we paid a redemption premium of $44.0 million. In connection with the redemption of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes, we wrote off $11.4 million of deferred financing fees. These amounts, along with the settlement of a related interest rate lock, resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $56.6 million in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. Sweetwater County Industrial Revenue Bond Refunding On December 15, 2005, we refinanced $90.0 million aggregate principal amount of Sweetwater County, Wyoming industrial revenue bonds issued in 1994 through a new industrial revenue bond issue in the same principal amount. We reduced our average interest cost from 6.95 percent per annum to 5.60 percent per annum and extended the maturity date by 11 years. The 1994 bonds were legally defeased by deposit with the trustee of the proceeds of the new bond issue and other funds provided by FMC, and the bonds were subsequently redeemed with a 1 percent redemption premium on January 17, 2006. This refinancing resulted in a charge of $2.1 million that is also included in loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, we had $196.4 million in U.S. dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings under the European Credit Agreement, resulting in available funds of $91.7 million. This facility was fully drawn at December 31, 2005. We had no borrowings under our Domestic Credit Agreement at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Letters of credit outstanding under the Domestic Credit Agreement totaled $144.5 million and $147.4 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Available funds under the Domestic Credit Agreement were $455.5 million at December 31, 2006 and $452.6 million at December 31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 were $165.5 million and $206.4 million, respectively. We had total debt of $629.7 million and $720.2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This included $523.5 million and $639.8 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $52.5 million and $0.9 million) at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Short-term debt, which consists primarily of foreign borrowings, decreased to $53.7 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $79.5 million at December 31, 2005. The $64.7 million decrease in total long-term debt at December 31, 2006 from December 31, 2005 was primarily due to partial repayment of our European Credit Agreement offset by higher exchange rates for the euro against the U.S. dollar. Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $307.2 million for 2006 compared to $199.6 million for 2005 and $239.0 million for 2004. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations and improved working capital management in inventories and accounts payable. These were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to our reduction in the use of vendor finance guarantees coupled with a decrease in accounts payable, which were offset by higher earnings. Cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was $43.2 million for 2006 compared to cash provided of $17.4 million and cash required of $28.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to higher environmental spending in 2006 and lower cash proceeds of $25.3 million from the sale of a portion of our San Jose property in 2006 as compared to similar proceeds of $56.1 million in 2005. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites. Discontinued environmental spending was $44.1 million in 2006 compared to $24.4 million in 2005 and $20.5 million in 2004. Cash required by investing activities was $109.8 million, $6.4 million and $114.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash required in 2006 was a result of 41 Table of Contents lower asset sale proceeds, primarily the asset sale of our former phosphorus joint venture, Astaris. This sale coupled with the sale of our investment in Sibelco was the primary reasons for the change from 2004 to 2005. Cash required by financing activities for 2006 was $198.5 million compared to cash required of $215.3 million in 2005. In 2004, cash provided by financing activities was $46.1 million. The decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the redemption of all of our 6.75 percent medium-term notes due May 2005 and all of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes due November 2009. The redemption of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes included a redemption premium of $44.0 million. Partially offsetting this change was the repurchase of $92.2 million of common stock and the payment of $21.0 million in dividends in 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we contributed approximately 235,000, 264,000 and 136,000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of $17.3 million, $14.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively, which is considered a non-cash activity. Commitments and other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2007 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, environmental spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our $600.0 million committed revolving credit facility. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses. Projected 2007 spending includes approximately $45.0 million of environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $10 million in 2007, respectively, on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend in the range of approximately $25 million to $26 million annually in 2007 for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections. We have historically made voluntary pension payments and plan to make payments totaling approximately $30 million in 2007. We also have executive severance guidelines and changes of control arrangements which are described in our proxy statement. On February 24, 2006, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share. In 2006, we declared dividends totaling $27.8 million. Additionally, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of our common stock. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Although the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time, we expect that the program will be accomplished over the next year. During 2006, we repurchased 1,414,389 shares at an aggregate cost of $90.0 million under this program. In 2001, we split FMC into separate chemical and machinery companies and we refer to the spun-off company, FMC Technologies, Inc. as Technologies throughout this Annual Report. We agreed to guarantee the performance by Technologies of a debt instrument (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2006, these guaranteed obligations totaled $2.4 million compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2005. We guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign equity method investments. The other investment owners provided parallel agreements. We also guarantee the repayment of the borrowing of a minority partner in a foreign affiliate that we consolidate in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, these guarantees had maximum potential payments of $8.2 million. 42 Table of Contents We also provide guarantees to the financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Product customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $25.6 million and $30.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These guarantees are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as guarantees of vendor financing. Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 & beyond Total (in Millions) Debt maturities (1) $ 106.2 $ 77.8 $ 2.1 $ 208.9 $ 235.2 $ 630.2 Contractual interest (2) 29.3 24.9 22.9 22.4 209.0 308.5 Lease obligations (3) 27.6 25.7 24.9 23.6 127.1 228.9 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts 24.7 0.1 24.8 Purchase Obligations (4) 48.4 13.3 3.2 2.5 7.2 74.6 Total $ 236.2 $ 141.8 $ 53.1 $ 257.4 $ 578.5 $ 1,267.0 (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $293 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2006. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2006. Variable rates are market determined. (3) Before recoveries. (4) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. Contingencies When Technologies was split from us in 2001, we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business, generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any period where Technologies is included in the consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries. The statute of limitations for the 2001 U.S. federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spin-off were raised during the IRS audit for 2000-2001, therefore any liability for taxes if the spin-off of Technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by Technologies has been favorably concluded. The tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items, which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. During 2004, we reached agreement in principle with the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle certain liabilities at two environmental remediation sites in New Jersey. A Consent Decree was negotiated and agreed and became final upon entry by the Court in early October 2006, requiring a payment by the company in the amount of $18 million. 43 Table of Contents On October 14, 2003, Solutia, our joint venture partner in Astaris, filed a lawsuit against us with the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri claiming that, among other things, we had breached our joint venture agreement due to the alleged failure of the PPA technology we contributed to Astaris and also failed to disclose the information we had about the PPA technology. Solutia dismissed this Missouri lawsuit in February 2004, after it had filed a virtually identical lawsuit in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. Solutia had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in that same court on December 17, 2003. Our motion to remove the lawsuit from Bankruptcy Court was granted on June 18, 2004, and the matter is now pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 29, 2005, the court dismissed certain of the claims relating to the alleged failure of the PPA technology for lack of standing on the part of Solutia. The PPA technology was not included in the sale to ICL described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K and will continue to be owned by Astaris, now known as Siratsa, LLC. A trial in this matter is scheduled to occur in April 2007, although the Court has rejected Solutia demand for a jury. On January 28, 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary Foret received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. All of the significant European hydrogen peroxide producers also received the Statement of Objections. We and Foret responded to the Statement of Objections in April 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of June 2005. On May 3, 2006, we received a notice from the European Commission indicating that the Commission has imposed a fine on us in the amount of 25.0 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 1997-1999. In connection with this fine, we recorded an expense of U.S. $30.0 million in our consolidated statements of income. This expense is included as a component of restructuring and other charges. Both we and Foret have appealed the decision of the Commission. During the appeal process, interest accrues on the fine at a variable rate, which as of December 31, 2006, was 4.1 percent per annum. We have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the European Commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest. At December 31, 2006, the amount of the letter of credit was 26.0 million (U.S. $34.0 million). We also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the Northern District of California, which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the United States during the period 1994 through 2003. At this time, we do not believe the investigations are related. In connection with these two matters, in February 2005 putative class action complaints were filed against all of the U.S. hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws. Federal Law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal anti-trust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees. Related cases were also filed in various state courts. All of the federal court cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). The District Court certified the class in January 2007. Most of the state court cases have been dismissed, although some remain in California. In addition, putative class actions have been filed in provincial courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia under the laws of Canada. Another anti-trust class action previously brought in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product was settled for $25.0 million, the same amount paid by our co-defendant Asahi Kasei Corporation. The Court approved this settlement in November 2006. The claims of plaintiffs who opted out of the class settlement were also settled late in 2006 for $0.7 million. Two related state court cases remain pending in California and Tennessee. We have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business.
