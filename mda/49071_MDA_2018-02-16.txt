ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview General Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. Our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well being and lower costs. Our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. To accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. Our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective. Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. Aetna Merger On July 2, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which we refer to in this report as the Merger Agreement, with Aetna Inc. and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Aetna Inc., which we refer to collectively as Aetna, which sets forth the terms and conditions under which we agreed to merge with, and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Aetna, a transaction we refer to in this report as the Merger. On February 14, 2017, we and Aetna agreed to mutually terminate the Merger Agreement, as our Board determined that an appeal of the Court's ruling would not be in the best interest of our stockholders. On February 16, 2017, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we received a breakup fee of $1 billion from Aetna, which is included in our consolidated statement of income in the line captioned Merger termination fee and related costs, net. Prior period Merger related transaction costs, previously included in operating costs, have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation. Acquisitions and Divestitures On December 19, 2017, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 40% minority interest in the Kindred at Home Division (Kindred at Home) of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (Kindred)(NYSE: KND), the nation largest home health provider and second largest hospice operator, for estimated cash consideration of approximately $800 million , including our share of transaction and related expenses, to facilitate a complete separation from the Long Term Acute Care and Rehabilitation businesses (the Specialty Hospital company). On November 6, 2017 , we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary, KMG to CGIC, a Texas-based insurance company wholly owned by HC2 Holdings, Inc., a diversified holding company. KMG subsidiary, KIC, includes our closed block of non-strategic commercial long-term care insurance policies. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for a discussion of our closed block of long-term care insurance policies. These transactions are more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Business Segments During the first quarter of 2017, we realigned certain of our businesses among our reportable segments to correspond with internal management reporting changes corresponding to those used by our chief operating decision maker to 39 evaluate results of operations and our previously announced planned exit from the Individual Commercial medical business on January 1, 2018. Additionally, we renamed our Group segment to the Group and Specialty segment, and began presenting the Individual Commercial business results as a separate segment rather than as part of the Retail segment. Specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, other supplemental health, and financial protection products, marketed to individuals are now included in the Group and Specialty segment. Specialty health insurance benefits marketed to employer groups continue to be included in the Group and Specialty segment. As a result of this realignment, our reportable segments now include Retail, Group and Specialty, Healthcare Services, and Individual Commercial. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2017 presentation. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for segment financial information. We manage our business with four reportable segments: Retail, Group and Specialty, Healthcare Services, and Individual Commercial. In addition, the Other Businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles. These segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and allocate resources. The Retail segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group accounts. In addition, the Retail segment also includes our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. The Group and Specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and voluntary insurance benefits, and financial protection products, as well as administrative services only, or ASO products. In addition, our Group and Specialty segment includes military services business, primarily our TRICARE contract. The Healthcare Services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties, including pharmacy solutions, provider services, and clinical care service, such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health. The Individual Commercial segment consists of our individual commercial fully-insured medical health insurance benefits. We report under the category of Other Businesses those businesses that do not align with the reportable segments described above, primarily our closed-block long-term care insurance policies. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and clinical care services, to our Retail, Group and Specialty, and Individual Commercial segment customers . Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations . Seasonality One of the product offerings of our Retail segment is Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under the Medicare Part D program. Our quarterly Retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low 40 income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern. In addition, the Retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season. Our Group and Specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern. However, the effect is opposite of Medicare stand-alone PDP in the Retail segment, with the Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Certain of our fully-insured individual commercial medical products in our Individual Commercial segment experience seasonality in the benefit ratio similar to the Group and Specialty segment, including the effect of existing previously underwritten members transitioning to policies compliant with the Health Care Reform Law with us and other carriers. As previously underwritten members transition, it results in policy lapses and the release of reserves for future policy benefits partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred acquisition costs. The recognition of a premium deficiency reserve for our Individual Commercial medical business compliant with the Health Care Reform Law in the fourth quarter of 2015, and subsequent changes in estimate, also impacted the quarterly benefit ratio pattern for this business in 2016. Highlights Consolidated Our 2017 results reflect the continued implementation of our strategy to offer our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. At the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. We believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. At December 31, 2017 , approximately 1,901,300 members, or 66.5% , of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 1,816,300 members, or 64.0% , at December 31, 2016 . Our consolidated pretax results of $4.02 billion for 2017, an increase of $2.47 billion , from $1.55 billion in 2016, primarily reflects the net gain associated with the terminated Merger Agreement, mainly the break-up fee, along with the year-over-year improvement in earnings for our Individual Commercial, Retail and Group and Specialty segments. The year-over-year comparison was also favorably impacted by the reserve strengthening for our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance business recorded in 2016 . These items were partially offset by lower pretax earnings in the Healthcare Services segment, charges associated with voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs recorded during the second half of 2017, as well as the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense to support the policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company). Year-over-year comparisons of diluted earnings per common share reflect the same factors impacting our consolidated pretax income comparisons year-over-year as well as the beneficial effect of the lower effective tax rate in light of pricing and benefit design assumptions associated with the 2017 temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee. In addition the year-over-year comparisons were favorably impacted by lower number of shares, primarily reflecting share repurchases. 41 We recorded a net gain associated with the terminated Merger Agreement, consisting primarily of the breakup fee, of approximately $936 million , or $4.31 per diluted common share, during 2017. During 2016 , we recorded transaction costs in connection with the Merger of approximately $104 million , or $0.64 per diluted common share. Certain costs associated with the Merger were previously not deductible for tax purposes, but became deductible, and were recorded as such, in the first quarter 2017 as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement. During 2017, we initiated a voluntary early retirement program and an involuntary workforce reduction program. These programs impacted approximately 3,600 associates, or 7.8% of our workforce. As a result, we recorded charges of $148 million , or $0.64 per diluted common share. This charge is included with operating costs in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and included at the corporate level in the segment financial information. Payments under these programs are made upon termination during the early retirement or severance pay period, beginning in the first quarter of 2018. We expect this liability to be primarily paid within the next 12 months and classified it as a current liability, included in our consolidated balance sheet in the trade accounts payable and accrued expenses line. On March 1, 2017, a court ordered the liquidation of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company), which triggered assessments from state guaranty associations that resulted in our recording a $54 million , or $0.24 per diluted common share, charge in operating costs. The annual health insurance industry fee has been suspended for calendar year 2017 but has resumed in calendar year 2018. Operating cost associated with the health insurer fee attributable to 2016 was $916 million. This fee is not deductible for tax purposes, which significantly increased our effective income tax rate. The one-year suspension in 2017 of the health insurer fee has significantly reduced our operating costs and effective tax rate during 2017. The Continuing Resolution bill, H.R. 195, enacted on January 22, 2018, included a one year suspension in 2019 of the health insurer fee, but the fee is scheduled to resume in calendar year 2020. Investment income increased $16 million in 2017 , primarily due to higher average invested balances and interest rates in 2017 , partially offset by lower realized capital gains. Operating cash flow provided by operations was $4.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to operating cash flow provided by operations of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 . The increase in operating cash flow primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee, net of related expenses and taxes paid, higher earnings and the timing of working capital items. We paid dividends to stockholders of $220 million in 2017 as compared to $177 million in 2016 . Retail Segment In 2017 , our Retail segment pretax income increased by $288 million , or 17.0% , from 2016 primarily driven by the year-over-year improvement in our Medicare Advantage business. On February 1, 2018, CMS issued its preliminary 2019 Medicare Advantage and Part D payment rates and proposed policy changes, which we refer to collectively as the Advance Notice. CMS has invited public comment on the Advance Notice before publishing final rates on April 2, 2018 (the Final Notice). In the Advance Notice, CMS estimates Medicare Advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 1.84 percent increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. As indicated by CMS, its estimate excludes the impact of fee for service county re-basing/re-pricing since the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the Final Notice. CMS estimate includes 30 basis points of negative impact associated with the proposed Employer Group Waiver Plan Payment Policy for 2019. Excluding that item, CMS estimate would be a 2.14 percent increase. Based on our preliminary analysis using the same factors CMS included in its estimate, the components of which are detailed on CMS web site, we anticipate the proposals in the Advance Notice would result in a change to our benchmark funding relatively in line with CMS estimate, excluding the impact attributable to the Employer Group Waiver Plan Payment Policy. 42 Group and Specialty Segment Group and Specialty segment pretax income was $412 million in 2017 , an increase of $68 million , or 19.8% , from $344 million in 2016 primarily reflecting the impact of higher pretax earnings associated with our fully-insured commercial medical products as well as higher earnings from our military services business resulting from higher performance incentives earned under the TRICARE contract. On July 21, 2016, we were notified by the Defense Health Agency, or DHA, that we were awarded the contract for the new TRICARE T2017 East Region. The T2017 East Region contract is a consolidation of the former T3 North and South Regions, comprising thirty-two states and approximately six million TRICARE beneficiaries, with delivery of health care services commencing on January 1, 2018. The T2017 East contract is a 5-year contract set to expire on December 31, 2022. Healthcare Services Segment Healthcare Services segment pretax income was $967 million in 2017 , a decrease $129 million , or 11.8% , from 2016 primarily due to the impact of the optimization process associated with our chronic care management programs, as well as lower earnings in our provider services business reflecting lower Medicare rates year-over-year in geographies where our provider assets are primarily located. The reductions in pharmacy solutions intersegment revenues were offset by similar reductions in operating costs associated with the pharmacy solutions business. At December 31, 2017, approximately 52,200 primary care providers were in value-based relationships, an increase of 3.6% from 50,400 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, 66% of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships compared to 64% at December 31, 2016. Medicare Advantage and dual demonstration program membership enrolled in a Humana chronic care management program was 794,900 at December 31, 2017, a decrease of 27.7% from 1,099,200 at December 31, 2016. We have undergone an optimization process that ensures the appropriate level of member interaction with clinicians to drive quality outcomes, which has resulted in reduced segment earnings but higher returns on investment. Individual Commercial Segment As announced on February 14, 2017, we exited our Individual Commercial medical business January 1, 2018. In 2017 , our Individual Commercial segment pretax income was $193 million , an increase of $1.1 billion , from a pretax loss of $869 million in 2016 primarily due to the exit of certain markets in 2017, and per-member premium increases, as well as the reduction of premiums related to the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program . Health Care Reform The Health Care Reform Law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry. Certain significant provisions of the Health Care Reform Law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally-facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee and a three-year $25 billion industry wide commercial reinsurance fee. The annual health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry is $14.3 billion in 2018 and is not deductible for income tax purposes, which significantly increases our effective income tax rate. A one year suspension in 2017 and 2019 of the health insurer fee significantly impacts our trend in key operating metrics including our operating cost and medical expense ratios, as well as our effective tax rate. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law expands federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis. Financing for these reforms comes, in part, from material additional fees and taxes on us (as discussed above) and other health plans and individuals which 43 began in 2014, as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under Medicare as described in this 2017 Form 10-K. As noted above, the Health Care Reform Law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective January 1, 2014, with an annual open enrollment period. For 2017, we offered on-exchange individual commercial medical plans in 11 states, a reduction from the 15 states in which we offered on-exchange coverage in 2016. In addition, we discontinued substantially all Health Care Reform Law compliant off-exchange individual commercial medical plans effective January 1, 2017. Effective January 1, 2018, we have exited our remaining Individual Commercial medical business. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law, our business may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, potential legislative changes, including activities to repeal or replace the Health Care Reform Law, creates uncertainty for our business, and we cannot predict when, or in what form, such legislative changes may occur. We may be unable to adjust our product offerings, geographic footprint, or pricing during any given year such legislative changes occur in sufficient time to mitigate any adverse effects. As discussed above, it is reasonably possible that the Health Care Reform Law and related regulations, as well as future legislative changes, including legislative restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or regulatory restrictions on profitability, including by comparison of our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability and a requirement that they remain within certain ranges of each other, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows. On November 10, 2016, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of the government in one of a series of cases filed by insurers, unrelated to us, against HHS to collect risk corridor payments, rejecting all of the insurer statutory, contract and Constitutional claims for payment. On November 18, 2016, HHS issued a memorandum indicating a significant funding shortfall for the 2015 coverage year, the second consecutive year of significant shortfalls. Given the successful challenge of the risk corridor provisions in court, Congressional inquiries into the funding of the risk corridor program, and significant funding shortfalls under the first two years of the program, during the fourth quarter of 2016 we wrote-off $583 million in risk corridor receivables outstanding as of September 30, 2016, including $415 million associated with the 2014 and 2015 coverage years. From inception of the risk corridor program through December 31, 2017, we collected approximately $39 million from CMS for risk corridor receivables associated with the 2014 coverage year funded by HHS in accordance with previous guidance, utilizing funds HHS collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 and 2015 risk corridor program. On November 2, 2017, we filed suit against the United States of America in the United States Court of Federal Claims, on behalf of our health plans seeking recovery from the federal government of approximately $611 million in payments under the risk corridor premium stabilization program established under the Health Care Reform Law, for years 2014, 2015 and 2016. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our Healthcare Services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and clinical care services, to our Retail, Group and Specialty, and Individual Commercial segment customers and are described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2017 Form 10-K. 44 Comparison of Results of Operations for 2017 and 2016 Certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 : Consolidated Change 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage (dollars in millions, except per common share results) Revenues: Premiums: Retail $ 44,626 $ 43,223 $ 1,403 3.2 % Group and Specialty 6,772 6,696 76 1.1 % Individual Commercial 947 3,064 (2,117 ) (69.1 )% Other Businesses 35 38 (3 ) (7.9 )% Total premiums 52,380 53,021 (641 ) (1.2 )% Services: Retail 10 6 4 66.7 % Group and Specialty 626 643 (17 ) (2.6 )% Healthcare Services 338 310 28 9.0 % Other Businesses 8 10 (2 ) (20.0 )% Total services 982 969 13 1.3 % Investment income 405 389 16 4.1 % Total revenues 53,767 54,379 (612 ) (1.1 )% Operating expenses: Benefits 43,496 45,007 (1,511 ) (3.4 )% Operating costs 6,567 7,173 (606 ) (8.4 )% Merger termination fee and related costs, net (936 ) 104 (1,040 ) (1,000.0 )% Depreciation and amortization 378 354 24 6.8 % Total operating expenses 49,505 52,638 (3,133 ) (6.0 )% Income from operations 4,262 1,741 2,521 144.8 % Interest expense 242 189 53 28.0 % Income before income taxes 4,020 1,552 2,468 159.0 % Provision for income taxes 1,572 938 634 67.6 % Net income $ 2,448 $ 614 $ 1,834 298.7 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 16.81 $ 4.07 $ 12.74 313.0 % Benefit ratio (a) 83.0 % 84.9 % (1.9 )% Operating cost ratio (b) 12.3 % 13.3 % (1.0 )% Effective tax rate 39.1 % 60.5 % (21.4 )% (a) Represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue. (b) Represents total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income. 45 Summary Net income for 2017 was $2.4 billion , or $16.81 per diluted common share compared to $614 million , or $4.07 per diluted common share, in 2016 . Net income in 2017 includes a net gain of $4.31 per diluted common share associated with the terminated Merger Agreement consisting primarily of the break-up fee, and the beneficial effect of the lower effective tax rate in light of pricing and benefit design assumptions with the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee of $2.15 per diluted common share, excluding the Individual Commercial business impact. The year-over-year comparison was also favorably impacted by a write-off of $2.43 per diluted common share in receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program, and the reserve strengthening for our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance business of $2.11 per common diluted share recorded in 2016 . These items were partially offset by the impact of the tax reform law enacted on December 22, 2017, or the Tax Reform Law, which resulted in the reduction of our net income due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates of $0.92 per diluted common share, $0.64 per common diluted share in charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs in 2017, as well as the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense to support the policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company) of $0.24 per diluted common share. Excluding the impacts of the items above, the increase in net income primarily was due to year-over-year improvements in earnings for our Individual Commercial, Retail, and Group and Specialty segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the Healthcare Services segment. Premiums Revenue Consolidated premiums decreased $641 million , or 1.2% , from 2016 to $52.4 billion for 2017 primarily due to lower premiums in the Individual Commercial segment, partially offset by higher premiums in the Retail segment, primarily resulting from growth in our Medicare Advantage business, and higher premiums in the Group and Specialty segment, as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. Services Revenue Consolidated services revenue increased $13 million , or 1.3% , from 2016 for 2017 primarily due to an increase in services revenue in the Healthcare Services segment, partially offset by a decrease in services revenue in the Group and Specialty segment as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. Investment Income Investment income was $405 million for 2017 , increasing $16 million , or 4.1% , from 2016 , primarily due higher average invested balances and interest rates in 2017 , partially offset by lower realized capital gains. Benefits Expense Consolidated benefits expense was $43.5 billion for 2017 , a decrease of $1.5 billion , or 3.4% , from 2016 reflecting $505 million in incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies recorded in 2016. Excluding the long-term care reserve strengthening in 2016 , the decrease primarily was due to a decrease in the Individual Commercial segment benefits expense, partially offset by an increase in the Retail and Group and Specialty segments benefits expense as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. As more fully described herein under the section entitled Benefits Expense Recognition , actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $483 million in 2017 and $582 million in 2016 . The consolidated benefit ratio for 2017 was 83.0% , a decrease of 190 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the incremental benefits expense in 2016 for the reserve strengthening in our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies. Excluding the impact of the above, the decrease in the consolidated benefit ratio primarily was due to the decrease in the Individual Commercial segment benefit ratio, partially offset by the increase in the Retail and Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio as discussed in the segment results of operation discussion that follows. Favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in 2017 versus approximately 110 basis points in 2016 . 46 Operating Costs Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Consolidated operating costs decreased $606 million , or 8.4% , from 2016 to $6.6 billion in 2017 primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for the calendar year 2017 and lower Individual Commercial membership. This was partially offset by charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs, an increase in employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance, increased spending associated with the Medicare Annual Election Period, or AEP, as well as the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense recorded to support the policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company). The consolidated operating cost ratio for 2017 was 12.3% , decreasing 100 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for the calendar year 2017, the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program in 2016, as well as operating cost efficiencies, partially offset by the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in the 2017 period associated with the Individual Commercial product, the estimated charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs recorded in 2017, increased employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance, as well as the impact of the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense recorded to support the policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term care insurance company). The non-deductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 170 basis points in 2016. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2017 of $378 million was relatively unchanged from 2016 . Interest Expense Interest expense was $242 million for 2017 compared to $189 million for 2016 , an increase of $53 million , or 28.0% , due to the issuance of $1.8 billion in senior notes, a portion of the proceeds which were used to redeem $800 million of senior notes scheduled to mature in 2018. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $17 million in December 2017 for the redemption of these senior notes, which is included in interest expense . Income Taxes Our effective tax rate during 2017 was 39.1% compared to the effective tax rate of 60.5% in 2016 primarily reflecting the suspension of the annual health insurance industry fee in 2017, as well as previously non-deductible transaction costs that, as a result of termination of the Merger Agreement, became deductible for tax purposes and were recorded as such in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by the Tax Reform Law, which increased our effective tax rate due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. The tax reform law enacted on December 22, 2017 significantly reduced our federal corporate tax rate. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 32.5% to 33.5% . The decline in the effective tax rate for 2018 primarily is due to the enactment of tax reform, partially offset by the resumption of the annual health insurance industry fee in 2018. 47 Retail Segment Change 2017 2016 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Individual Medicare Advantage 2,860,800 2,837,600 23,200 0.8 % Group Medicare Advantage 441,400 355,400 86,000 24.2 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 5,308,100 4,951,400 356,700 7.2 % Total Retail Medicare 8,610,300 8,144,400 465,900 5.7 % State-based Medicaid 360,100 388,100 (28,000 ) (7.2 )% Medicare Supplement 235,900 218,800 17,100 7.8 % Total Retail medical members 9,206,300 8,751,300 455,000 5.2 % Change 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Individual Medicare Advantage $ 32,720 $ 31,863 $ 857 2.7 % Group Medicare Advantage 5,155 4,283 872 20.4 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,702 4,009 (307 ) (7.7 )% Total Retail Medicare 41,577 40,155 1,422 3.5 % State-based Medicaid 2,571 2,640 (69 ) (2.6 )% Medicare Supplement 478 428 50 11.7 % Total premiums 44,626 43,223 1,403 3.2 % Services 10 6 4 66.7 % Total premiums and services revenue $ 44,636 $ 43,229 $ 1,407 3.3 % Income before income taxes $ 1,978 $ 1,690 $ 288 17.0 % Benefit ratio 85.6 % 85.1 % 0.5 % Operating cost ratio 9.6 % 10.8 % (1.2 )% Pretax Results Retail segment pretax income was $2.0 billion in 2017 , an increase of $288 million , or 17.0% , compared to 2016 primarily driven by the year-over-year improvement in our Medicare Advantage business. Enrollment Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 23,200 members, or 0.8% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting net membership additions for Medicare beneficiaries including the effect of planned market and product exits in 2017. We decided certain markets and/or products were not meeting long term strategic and financial objectives. Additionally, membership growth was muted due to competitive actions including the uncertainty associated with the then-pending Merger transaction during last year's AEP. For full year 2018 , we anticipate net membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage offerings of 180,000 to 200,000. Group Medicare Advantage membership increased 86,000 members, or 24.2% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting the addition of a large account in January 2017. For full year 2018 , we anticipate net membership growth in our group Medicare Advantage offerings of 65,000 to 70,000. 48 Medicare stand-alone PDP membership increased 356,700 members, or 7.2% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting net membership additions, primarily for our Humana-Walmart plan offering, for the 2017 plan year. For full year 2018 , we anticipate a net membership decline in our Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings of 280,000 to 320,000, primarily attributable to the loss of auto assign members in Florida and South Carolina due to pricing over the CMS low income benchmark and continued membership declines in our Enhanced Plan offering. State-based Medicaid membership decreased 28,000 members, or 7.2% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 , primarily driven by lower membership associated with our Florida contracts resulting from network realignments. Premiums revenue Retail segment premiums increased $1.4 billion , or 3.2% , from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to Medicare Advantage membership growth and increased per-member premiums for certain of the segment's products. Average group and individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 3.4% in 2017 . Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per-member premiums. Items impacting average per-member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Benefits expense The Retail segment benefit ratio of 85.6% for 2017 increased 50 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, margin compression associated with the competitive environment in the group Medicare Advantage business and slightly lower favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development. These increases were partially offset by the impact of planned exits from certain Medicare Advantage markets that carried a higher benefit ratio than other markets as well as lower than expected medical costs as compared to the assumptions used in the pricing of our individual Medicare Advantage business. The Retail segment benefits expense for 2017 included the beneficial effect of $386 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development versus $429 million in 2016 . This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in 2017 versus approximately 100 basis points in 2016 . Operating costs The Retail segment operating cost ratio of 9.6% for 2017 decreased 120 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017, partially offset by increased spending associated with AEP, investments in our integrated care delivery model, and the increase in employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 170 basis points in 2016 . 49 Group and Specialty Segment Change 2017 2016 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Fully-insured commercial group 1,097,700 1,136,000 (38,300 ) (3.4 )% ASO 458,700 573,200 (114,500 ) (20.0 )% Military services 3,081,800 3,084,100 (2,300 ) (0.1 )% Total group medical members 4,638,200 4,793,300 (155,100 ) (3.2 )% Specialty membership (a) 6,986,000 6,961,200 24,800 0.4 % (a) Specialty products include dental, vision, voluntary benefit products and other supplemental health and financial protection products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. Change 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Fully-insured commercial group $ 5,462 $ 5,405 $ 57 1.1 % Specialty 1,310 1,279 31 2.4 % Military services 12 (12 ) (100.0 )% Total premiums 6,772 6,696 76 1.1 % Services 626 643 (17 ) (2.6 )% Total premiums and services revenue $ 7,398 $ 7,339 $ 59 0.8 % Income before income taxes $ 412 $ 344 $ 68 19.8 % Benefit ratio 79.2 % 78.2 % 1.0 % Operating cost ratio 21.4 % 23.5 % (2.1 )% Pretax Results Group and Specialty segment pretax income was $412 million in 2017 , an increase of $68 million , or 19.8% , from $344 million in 2016 primarily reflecting the impact of higher pretax earnings associated with our fully-insured commercial business as well as higher earnings from our military services business resulting from higher performance incentives earned under the TRICARE contract. Enrollment Fully-insured commercial group medical membership decreased 38,300 members, or 3.4% from December 31, 2016 reflecting lower membership in small group accounts due in part to more small group accounts selecting ASO products in 2017. Group ASO commercial medical membership decreased 114,500 members, or 20.0% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to the loss of certain large group accounts as a result of continued discipline in pricing of services for self-funded accounts amid a highly competitive environment, partially offset by more small group accounts selecting ASO products in 2017. Specialty membership increased 24,800 members, or 0.4% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily due to strong growth in vision products marketed to employer groups. 50 Premiums revenue Group and Specialty segment premiums increased $76 million , or 1.1% , from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in group fully-insured commercial medical per-member premiums, partially offset by a decline in average group fully-insured commercial medical membership. Services revenue Group and Specialty segment services revenue decreased $17 million , or 2.6% , from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to a decline in revenue in our group ASO commercial medical business mainly due to membership declines partially offset by higher revenue from our military services business resulting from higher performance incentives earned under the TRICARE contract. Benefits expense The Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio increased 100 basis points from 78.2% in 2016 to 79.2% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017 which was contemplated in the pricing of our products. The increase was further impacted by an increased proportion of small group members transitioning to community rated plans that carry a higher benefit ratio. These increases were partially offset by lower utilization for the fully-insured commercial medical business in 2017, primarily associated with the large group business. The Group and Specialty segment benefits expense included the beneficial effect of $40 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development in 2017 versus $46 million in 2016 . This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 60 basis points in 2017 versus approximately 70 basis points in 2016 . Operating costs The Group and Specialty segment operating cost ratio of 21.4% for 2017 decreased 210 basis points from 23.5% for 2016 primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017 as well as operating cost efficiencies, partially offset by an increase in employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 150 basis points in 2016 . 51 Healthcare Services Segment Change 2017 2016 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Revenues: Services: Clinical care services $ 181 $ 201 $ (20 ) (10.0 )% Pharmacy solutions 80 31 49 158.1 % Provider services 77 78 (1 ) (1.3 )% Total services revenues 338 310 28 9.0 % Intersegment revenues: Pharmacy solutions 20,881 21,952 (1,071 ) (4.9 )% Provider services 1,593 1,677 (84 ) (5.0 )% Clinical care services 1,111 1,343 (232 ) (17.3 )% Total intersegment revenues 23,585 24,972 (1,387 ) (5.6 )% Total services and intersegment revenues $ 23,923 $ 25,282 $ (1,359 ) (5.4 )% Income before income taxes $ 967 $ 1,096 $ (129 ) (11.8 )% Operating cost ratio 95.5 % 95.2 % 0.3 % Pretax results Healthcare Services segment pretax income was $967 million in 2017 , a decrease of $129 million , or 11.8% , from 2016 primarily was due to the impact of the optimization process associated with our chronic care management programs, as well as lower earnings in our provider services business reflecting lower Medicare rates year-over-year in geographies where our provider assets are primarily located. The reductions in pharmacy solutions intersegment revenues were offset by similar reductions in operating costs associated with the pharmacy solutions business. Script Volume Humana Pharmacy Solutions script volumes for the Retail and Group and Specialty segment membership increased to approximately 433 million in 2017 , up 2% versus scripts of approximately 426 million in 2016 . The increase primarily reflects growth associated with higher Medicare membership for 2017 than in 2016 , partially offset by the decline in Individual Commercial membership. Services revenue Services revenue increased $28 million , or 9.0% , from 2016 to $338 million for 2017 primarily due to service revenue growth from our pharmacy solutions business. Intersegment revenues Intersegment revenues decreased $1.4 billion , or 5.6% , from 2016 to $23.6 billion for 2017 primarily due to our pharmacy solutions business as well as the result of the optimization process associated with our chronic care management programs discussed previously, as well as lower revenue in our provider services business reflecting lower Medicare rates year-over-year in geographies where our provider assets are primarily located. Our pharmacy solutions business revenues were impacted by improvements in net pharmacy costs driven by our pharmacy benefit manager and an increase in the generic dispensing rate. These items were partially offset by higher year-over-year script volume from growth in our Medicare Advantage and standalone PDP membership, partially offset by the impact of lower Individual Commercial membership. Our generic dispensing rate improved to 91.3% during 2017 from 90.5% during 2016. The higher generic dispensing rate 52 reduced revenues (and operating costs) for our pharmacy solutions business as generic drugs are generally priced lower than branded drugs. Operating costs The Healthcare Services segment operating cost ratio of 95.5% for 2017 was relatively unchanged from 95.2% for 2016. Individual Commercial Segment As announced on February 14, 2017, we exited our Individual Commercial medical business January 1, 2018. In 2017 , our Individual Commercial segment pretax income was $193 million , an increase of $1.1 billion , from a pretax loss of $869 million in 2016 primarily due to the exit of certain markets in 2017, and per-member premium increases, as well as the reduction of premiums related to the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program . Individual commercial medical membership decreased 526,000 members, or 80.3% , from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 reflecting the decline in the number of counties we offered on-exchange coverage and the discontinuance of offering off-exchange products. The Individual Commercial segment benefit ratio of 57.4% for 2017 decreased from 107.7% in 2016 primarily due to the reduction of premiums related to the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program , as well as the planned exits in 2017 in certain markets that carried a higher benefit ratio and per-member premium increases. The Individual Commercial segment operating cost ratio of 21.2% for 2017 increased 160 basis points from 2016 primarily due to the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in 2017, partially offset by the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program and the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017. Other Businesses As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased future policy benefits expense by approximately $505 million for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of long-term care insurance policies. This increase primarily was driven by emerging experience indicating longer claims duration, a prolonged lower interest rate environment, and an increase in policyholder life expectancies as discussed further in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2017 Form 10-K. 53 Comparison of Results of Operations for 2016 and 2015 Certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 : Consolidated Change 2016 2015 Dollars Percentage (dollars in millions, except per common share results) Revenues: Premiums: Retail $ 43,223 $ 41,605 $ 1,618 3.9 % Group and Specialty 6,696 6,830 (134 ) (2.0 )% Individual Commercial 3,064 3,939 (875 ) (22.2 )% Other Businesses 38 35 3 8.6 % Total premiums 53,021 52,409 612 1.2 % Services: Retail 6 8 (2 ) (25.0 )% Group and Specialty 643 658 (15 ) (2.3 )% Healthcare Services 310 726 (416 ) (57.3 )% Other Businesses 10 14 (4 ) (28.6 )% Total services 969 1,406 (437 ) (31.1 )% Investment income 389 474 (85 ) (17.9 )% Total revenues 54,379 54,289 90 0.2 % Operating expenses: Benefits 45,007 44,269 738 1.7 % Operating costs 7,173 7,295 (122 ) (1.7 )% Merger termination fee and related costs, net 104 23 81 352.2 % Depreciation and amortization 354 355 (1 ) (0.3 )% Total operating expenses 52,638 51,942 696 1.3 % Income from operations 1,741 2,347 (606 ) (25.8 )% Gain on sale of business 270 (270 ) (100.0 )% Interest expense 189 186 3 1.6 % Income before income taxes 1,552 2,431 (879 ) (36.2 )% Provision for income taxes 938 1,155 (217 ) (18.8 )% Net income $ 614 $ 1,276 $ (662 ) (51.9 )% Diluted earnings per common share $ 4.07 $ 8.44 $ (4.37 ) (51.8 )% Benefit ratio (a) 84.9 % 84.5 % 0.4 % Operating cost ratio (b) 13.3 % 13.6 % (0.3 )% Effective tax rate 60.5 % 47.5 % 13.0 % (a) Represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue. (b) Represents total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenues less investment income. 54 Summary Net income was $614 million , or $4.07 per diluted common share, in 2016 compared to $1.3 billion , or $8.44 per diluted common share, in 2015 . Net income includes a write-off of $2.43 per diluted common share in receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program and reserve strengthening for our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance business of $2.11 per diluted common share, as discussed below. These items were partially offset by the impact of the premium deficiency reserve of $0.74 per diluted common share recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year. In addition, the completion of the sale of Concentra on June 1, 2015 resulted in an after-tax gain of $1.57 per diluted common share in 2015. Excluding these items, the increase primarily was due to year-over-year improvement in results for our individual Medicare Advantage business and our Healthcare Services segment as well as increased profitability in our state-based Medicaid business, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate as discussed below. In addition, 2016 includes expenses of $0.64 per diluted common share and 2015 includes expenses of $0.14 per diluted common share for transaction and integration planning costs associated with the Merger, certain of which were not deductible for tax purposes until 2017. Premiums Revenue Consolidated premiums increased $612 million , or 1.2% , from 2015 to $53.0 billion for 2016 primarily reflecting higher premiums in the Retail segment mainly driven by average membership growth and per member premium increases for certain of our lines of business. These increases were partially offset by the write-off of $583 million of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program, the loss of premiums associated with a large group Medicare account that moved to a private exchange on January 1, 2016, and a decline in premiums revenue associated with fewer individual commercial medical members as discussed in our segment results of operations discussion that follows. Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Services Revenue Consolidated services revenue decreased $437 million , or 31.1% , from 2015 to $1.0 billion for 2016 primarily due to the completion of the sale of Concentra on June 1, 2015. Investment Income Investment income totaled $389 million for 2016 , a decrease of $85 million , or 17.9% , from 2015 , primarily due to lower realized capital gains in 2016 and lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average invested balance. Benefits Expense Consolidated benefits expense was $45.0 billion for 2016 , an increase of $738 million , or 1.7% , from 2015 primarily due to $505 million in incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies partially offset by the premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year. Excluding the long-term care reserve strengthening and impact of the premium deficiency reserve, the increase is primarily due to an increase in the Retail segment mainly driven by higher average individual Medicare Advantage membership. As more fully described herein under the section entitled Benefits Expense Recognition , actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $582 million in 2016 and $236 million in 2015 . The increase in prior-period medical claims reserve development year over-year primarily was due to favorable year-over-year comparisons for our Medicare Advantage and individual commercial medical businesses. 55 The consolidated benefit ratio for 2016 was 84.9% , an increase of 40 basis points from 2015 primarily due to the incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies, the impact on the benefit ratio of lower consolidated premiums associated with the write-off of receivables for the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program, and the impact of the premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year. Excluding the impact of the write-off of the commercial risk corridor receivables and the premium deficiency reserve, these items were partially offset by year-over-year improvement in both the Retail and Group and Specialty segment benefit ratios as discussed in the segment results of operations discussion that follows. Favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 110 basis points in 2016 versus approximately 50 basis points in 2015 . Operating Costs Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Consolidated operating costs decreased $122 million , or 1.7% , from 2015 to $7.2 billion in 2016 primarily due to the completion of the sale of Concentra on June 1, 2015. The consolidated operating cost ratio for 2016 was 13.3% , decreasing 30 basis points from 2015 primarily due to the completion of the sale of Concentra on June 1, 2015. Concentra carried a higher operating cost ratio than our Group and Specialty and Retail segments. This was partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year comparison associated with the temporary suspension of certain discretionary administrative costs in the latter half of 2015, along with the impact of the commercial risk corridor receivables write-off in the fourth quarter of 2016. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2016 of $354 million was relatively unchanged from 2015 . Interest Expense Interest expense was $189 million for 2016 compared to $186 million for 2015 , an increase of $3 million , or 1.6% . Income Taxes Our effective tax rate during 2016 was 60.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 47.5% in 2015 primarily reflecting lower pretax income year-over-year, the beneficial effect of the sale of Concentra on June 1, 2015 and the impact of non-deductible transaction costs associated with the Merger. Non-deductible transaction and integration planning costs associated with the Merger increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3.4 percentage points in 2016 versus approximately 0.4 percentage points in 2015 . Conversely, the tax effect of the sale of Concentra reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 4.5 percentage points in 2015. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2016 also reflects tax benefits associated with adopting new guidance related to the accounting for employee share-based payments effective January 1, 2016 as described in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, which decreased our effective tax rate by approximately 1.2 percentage points in 2016. 56 Retail Segment Change 2016 2015 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Individual Medicare Advantage 2,837,600 2,753,400 84,200 3.1 % Group Medicare Advantage 355,400 484,100 (128,700 ) (26.6 )% Medicare stand-alone PDP 4,951,400 4,557,900 393,500 8.6 % Total Retail Medicare 8,144,400 7,795,400 349,000 4.5 % State-based Medicaid 388,100 373,700 14,400 3.9 % Medicare Supplement 218,800 158,600 60,200 38.0 % Total Retail medical members 8,751,300 8,327,700 423,600 5.1 % Change 2016 2015 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Individual Medicare Advantage $ 31,863 $ 29,526 $ 2,337 7.9 % Group Medicare Advantage 4,283 5,588 (1,305 ) (23.4 )% Medicare stand-alone PDP 4,009 3,846 163 4.2 % Total Retail Medicare 40,155 38,960 1,195 3.1 % State-based Medicaid 2,640 2,341 299 12.8 % Medicare Supplement 428 304 124 40.8 % Total premiums 43,223 41,605 1,618 3.9 % Services 6 8 (2 ) (25.0 )% Total premiums and services revenue $ 43,229 $ 41,613 $ 1,616 3.9 % Income before income taxes $ 1,690 $ 1,259 $ 431 34.2 % Benefit ratio 85.1 % 86.7 % (1.6 )% Operating cost ratio 10.8 % 10.3 % 0.5 % Pretax Results Retail segment pretax income was $1,690 million in 2016 , an increase of $431 million , or 34.2% , compared to 2015 primarily driven by the year-over-year improvement in our individual Medicare Advantage and state-based Medicaid businesses. Enrollment Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 84,200 members, or 3.1% , from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 reflecting net membership additions, particularly for our HMO offerings, for the 2016 plan year. Group Medicare Advantage membership decreased 128,700 members, or 26.6% , from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 reflecting the loss of a large account that moved to a private exchange offering on January 1, 2016. 57 Medicare stand-alone PDP membership increased 393,500 members, or 8.6% , from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 reflecting net membership additions, primarily for our Humana-Walmart plan offering, for the 2016 plan year. State-based Medicaid membership increased 14,400 members, or 3.9% , from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 primarily driven by the addition of members under our Florida Medicaid contract. Premiums revenue Retail segment premiums increased $1,618 million , or 3.9% , from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to higher average membership for our individual Medicare Advantage and state-based Medicaid businesses and per member premium increases for certain lines of business. Average individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 3.9% in 2016 . Benefits expense The Retail segment benefit ratio of 85.1% for 2016 decreased 160 basis points from 2015 primarily due to lower year-over-year Medicare Advantage utilization, and favorable comparisons of prior-year medical claims reserve development. The Retail segment benefits expense for 2016 included the beneficial effect of $429 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development versus $248 million in 2015 . This favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the Retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in 2016 versus approximately 60 basis points in 2015 . The year-over-year increase in prior-period medical claims reserve development primarily was due to favorable year-over-year comparisons for our Medicare Advantage business. Operating costs The Retail segment operating cost ratio of 10.8% for 2016 increased 50 basis points from 2015 primarily due to the unfavorable comparison to unusually low operating expenses in 2015 resulting from the temporary suspension of certain discretionary administrative costs, and the loss of a large group Medicare Advantage account which carried a lower operating cost ratio than that for our individual Medicare Advantage business. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 170 basis points in 2016 as compared to 160 basis points in 2015 . Group and Specialty Segment Change 2016 2015 Members Percentage Membership: Medical membership: Fully-insured commercial group 1,136,000 1,178,300 (42,300 ) (3.6 )% ASO 573,200 710,700 (137,500 ) (19.3 )% Military services 3,084,100 3,074,400 9,700 0.3 % Total group medical members 4,793,300 4,963,400 (170,100 ) (3.4 )% Specialty membership (a) 6,961,200 7,221,800 (260,600 ) (3.6 )% (a) Specialty products include dental, vision, voluntary benefit products and other supplemental health and financial protection products. Members included in these products may not be unique to each product since members have the ability to enroll in multiple products. 58 Change 2016 2015 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Premiums and Services Revenue: Premiums: Fully-insured commercial group $ 5,405 $ 5,493 $ (88 ) (1.6 )% Specialty 1,279 1,316 (37 ) (2.8 )% Military services 12 21 (9 ) (42.9 )% Total premiums 6,696 6,830 (134 ) (2.0 )% Services 643 658 (15 ) (2.3 )% Total premiums and services revenue $ 7,339 $ 7,488 $ (149 ) (2.0 )% Income before income taxes $ 344 $ 321 $ 23 7.2 % Benefit ratio 78.2 % 78.8 % (0.6 )% Operating cost ratio 23.5 % 23.4 % 0.1 % Pretax Results Group and Specialty segment pretax income was $344 million in 2016 , an increase of $23 million , or 7.2% , from $321 million in 2015 driven by the improvement in the benefit ratio as discussed below. Enrollment Fully-insured commercial group medical membership decreased 42,300 members, or 3.6% from December 31, 2015 reflecting lower membership in both large and small group accounts. Group ASO commercial medical membership decreased 137,500 members, or 19.3% , from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 primarily due to the loss of certain large group accounts as a result of continued discipline in pricing of services for self-funded accounts amid a highly competitive environment. Specialty membership decreased 260,600 members, or 3.6% , from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 primarily due to the loss of several large stand-alone dental and vision accounts as well as the loss of certain fully-insured group medical accounts that also had specialty coverage. The decrease includes the loss of certain individual commercial medical members that also had specialty coverage. Premiums revenue Group and Specialty segment premiums decreased $134 million , or 2.0% , from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to a decline in fully-insured commercial medical membership as described above, partially offset by an increase in fully-insured commercial medical per member premiums. Services revenue Group and Specialty segment services revenue decreased $15 million , or 2.3% , from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to a decline in group ASO commercial medical membership. Benefits expense The Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio decreased 60 basis points from 78.8% in 2015 to 78.2% in 2016 primarily reflecting the beneficial effect of higher prior-year medical claims reserve development in 2016 and lower utilization. The Group and Specialty segment benefits expense included the beneficial effect of $46 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development in 2016 versus $7 million in 2015 . This favorable prior-year 59 medical claims reserve development decreased the Group and Specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2016 versus approximately 10 basis points in 2015 . Operating costs The Group and Specialty segment operating cost ratio of 23.5% for 2016 increased 10 basis points from 23.4% for 2015 , primarily due to the unfavorable comparison to unusually low operating expenses in 2015 resulting from the temporary suspension of certain discretionary administrative costs. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 150 basis points in 2016 as compared to 140 basis points in 2015 . Healthcare Services Segment Change 2016 2015 Dollars Percentage (in millions) Revenues: Services: Clinical care services $ 201 $ 181 $ 20 11.0 % Provider services 78 515 (437 ) (84.9 )% Pharmacy solutions 31 30 1 3.3 % Total services revenues 310 726 (416 ) (57.3 )% Intersegment revenues: Pharmacy solutions 21,952 20,551 1,401 6.8 % Provider services 1,677 1,291 386 29.9 % Clinical care services 1,343 1,208 135 11.2 % Total intersegment revenues 24,972 23,050 1,922 8.3 % Total services and intersegment revenues $ 25,282 $ 23,776 $ 1,506 6.3 % Income before income taxes $ 1,096 $ 1,022 $ 74 7.2 % Operating cost ratio 95.2 % 95.0 % 0.2 % Pretax results Healthcare Services segment pretax income of $1,096 million for 2016 increased $74 million , or 7.2% , from 2015 primarily due to incremental earnings associated with revenue growth from our pharmacy solutions business as it increased mail-order penetration and served our growing individual Medicare membership. The increase was partially offset by lower earnings in our provider services business reflecting significantly lower Medicare rates year-over-year associated with CMS' risk coding recalibration for 2016 in geographies where our provider assets are primarily located. Script Volume Humana Pharmacy Solutions script volumes for the Retail and Group and Specialty segment membership increased to approximately 426 million in 2016 , up 7% versus scripts of approximately 398 million in 2015 . The increase primarily reflects growth associated with higher average medical membership for 2016 than in 2015 . Services revenue Services revenue decreased $416 million , or 57.3% , from 2015 to $310 million for 2016 primarily due to the completion of the sale of Concentra on June 1, 2015. 60 Intersegment revenues Intersegment revenues increased $1.9 billion , or 8.3% , from 2015 to $25.0 billion for 2016 primarily due to increased mail order penetration and growth in our individual Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone PDP membership which resulted in increased engagement of members in clinical programs and higher utilization of services across the segment. Operating costs The Healthcare Services segment operating cost ratio of 95.2% for 2016 increased slightly from 2015 primarily due to a higher operating cost ratio for our provider services business reflecting significantly lower Medicare rates year-over-year as discussed above, partially offset by operating cost efficiencies associated with our pharmacy operations. Individual Commercial Segment In 2016 , our Individual Commercial segment pretax loss decreased by $436 million , or 100.7% , from 2015 primarily driven by the write-off of commercial risk corridor receivables, partially offset by the impact of the premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 associated with certain individual commercial medical policies from the 2016 coverage year. Individual commercial medical membership decreased 244,300 members, or 27.2% , from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 primarily reflecting the loss of on-exchange members due to product competitiveness, the loss of membership associated with the discontinuance of certain Health Care Reform Law compliant plans in 2016, the loss of membership associated with non-payment of premiums or termination by CMS due to lack of eligibility documentation, and the loss of members subscribing to plans that are not compliant with the Health Care Reform Law. The Individual Commercial segment benefit ratio of 107.7% for 2016 increased from 91.1% in 2015 primarily due to the reduction of premiums related to the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program, partially offset by the impact of the premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year. As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a premium deficiency reserve associated with our 2016 individual commercial offerings compliant with the Health Care Reform Law. During 2016, we increased the premium deficiency reserve for the 2016 coverage year and recorded a change in estimate of $208 million with a corresponding increase in benefits expense primarily as a result of unfavorable current and projected claims experience. The Individual Commercial segment operating cost ratio of 19.6% for 2016 increased 40 basis points from 2015 primarily due to the impact on premiums of the write-off of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program. The non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 200 basis points in 2016 as compared to 170 basis points in 2015 . Other Businesses As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we increased future policy benefits expense by approximately $505 million for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of long-term care insurance policies. This increase primarily was driven by emerging experience indicating longer claims duration, a prolonged lower interest rate environment, and an increase in policyholder life expectancies as discussed further in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this 2016 Form 10-K. 61 Liquidity Historically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, borrowings, and proceeds from sales of businesses. Our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. From period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. Our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D subsidies for which we do not assume risk. The use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. Our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our Healthcare Services segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators). The effect of the commercial risk adjustment, risk corridor, and reinsurance provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have impacted the timing of our operating cash flows, as we build receivables for each coverage year that are expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years. Net collections under the 3Rs associated with prior coverage years were $440 million in 2017 as compared to $383 million in 2016. As more fully described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we wrote off $583 million in risk corridor receivables outstanding as of September 30, 2016, including $415 million associated with the 2014 and 2015 coverage years. From inception of the risk corridor program through December 31, 2017, we collected approximately $39 million from CMS for risk corridor receivables associated with the 2014 coverage year funded by HHS in accordance with previous guidance, utilizing funds HHS collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 and 2015 risk corridor program. On November 2, 2017, we filed suit against the United States of America in the United States Court of Federal Claims, on behalf of our health plans seeking recovery from the federal government of approximately $611 million in payments under the risk corridor premium stabilization program established under the Health Care Reform Law, for years 2014, 2015 and 2016. The remaining net receivable balance associated with the 3Rs was approximately $31 million at December 31, 2017 , including the $44 million reinsurance receivable related to the 2016 coverage year, as compared to $456 million at December 31, 2016 . The remaining net receivable balance is primarily related to our Individual Commercial medical business which we have exited January 1, 2018. For additional information on our liquidity risk, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this 2017 Form 10-K. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2017 from $3.9 billion at December 31, 2016 . The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 is summarized as follows: 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,051 $ 1,936 $ 868 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (2,941 ) (1,362 ) 320 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (945 ) 732 (552 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 165 $ 1,306 $ 636 62 Cash Flow from Operating Activities The change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in the timing of working capital items, earnings, and enrollment activity as discussed below. The increase in operating cash flows in 2017 primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee, net of related expenses and taxes paid, higher earnings and the timing of working capital items. The increase in operating cash flows in 2016 primarily was due to the timing of working capital items and higher earnings exclusive of the commercial risk corridor receivables write-off and the long-term care reserve strengthening in 2016, as well as the gain on sale of Concentra and the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve in 2015 discussed previously. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables. The detail of benefits payable was as follows at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) IBNR (1) $ 3,154 $ 3,422 $ 3,730 $ (268 ) $ (308 ) $ 476 Reported claims in process (2) 614 654 600 (40 ) 54 125 Premium deficiency reserve (3) 176 (176 ) 176 Other benefits payable (4) 900 487 470 413 17 (276 ) Total benefits payable $ 4,668 $ 4,563 $ 4,976 $ 105 $ (413 ) $ 501 (1) IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date and includes unprocessed claim inventories. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. (3) Premium deficiency reserve recognized for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the Health Care Reform Law associated with the 2016 coverage year. (4) Other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements. The increase in benefits payable in 2017 largely was due to an increase in amounts owed under capitated, risk sharing, and quality incentive arrangements, partially offset by a decrease in IBNR. Benefits payable decreased in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in IBNR, as well as the application of 2016 results to the premium deficiency reserve liability recognized in 2015 associated with our individual commercial medical products compliant with the Health Care Reform Law for the 2016 coverage year. There was no premium deficiency reserve liability at December 31, 2016 or 2017. The increase in benefits payable in 2015 largely was due to increases in IBNR and in the amount of processed but unpaid claims due to our pharmacy benefit administrator, which fluctuates due to month-end cutoff. These items were partially offset by a decrease in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements in 2015, including the disbursement of a portion of our Medicare risk adjustment collections under our contractual obligations associated with our risk sharing arrangements. In addition, benefits payable in 2015 reflects the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve discussed previously. IBNR decreased during 2017 and 2016 primarily due to declines in individual and fully-insured group commercial membership. The decrease in IBNR during 2016 was also impacted by declines in group Medicare Advantage. IBNR increased during 2015 primarily as a result of individual Medicare Advantage membership growth. As discussed previously, our cash flows are impacted by changes in enrollment. The decline in membership experienced in 2017 and 2016 negatively impacted operating cash flows for those years. 63 The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Medicare $ 511 $ 787 $ 765 $ (276 ) $ 22 $ 101 Commercial and other 273 579 420 (306 ) 159 39 Military services 166 32 77 134 (45 ) (29 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts (96 ) (118 ) (101 ) 22 (17 ) (3 ) Total net receivables $ 854 $ 1,280 $ 1,161 (426 ) 119 108 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Provision for doubtful accounts 20 39 61 Change in receivables acquired, held-for-sale, or disposed from sale of business 11 Change in receivables per cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ (406 ) $ 158 $ 180 Medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group Medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. The decrease in commercial and other receivables in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily was due to a decrease in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the Health Care Reform Law. The increases in commercial and other receivables in 2016 and 2015 primarily reflect increases in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the Health Care Reform Law. Military services receivables at December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our TRICARE South Region contract. The 2017 balance also includes transition-in receivables under our T2017 East Region contract with collection scheduled in 2018. Many provisions of the Health Care Reform Law became effective in 2014, including the commercial risk adjustment, risk corridor, and reinsurance provisions as well as the non-deductible health insurance industry fee. As discussed previously, the timing of payments and receipts associated with these provisions impacted our operating cash flows as we built receivables for each coverage year that were expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years. Net collections under the 3Rs associated with prior coverage years were $440 million as compared to net collections of $383 million in 2016 . The net receivable balance associated with the 3Rs was approximately $31 million at December 31, 2017 , including certain amounts recorded in receivables as noted above. The annual health insurance industry fee was suspended for the calendar year 2017 , but has resumed in calendar year 2018. The annual health insurance industry fee was also suspended for the calendar year 2019 and is scheduled to resume in calendar year 2020. We paid the federal government annual health insurance industry fees of $916 million in 2016 and $ 867 million in 2015 . We have exited our individual commercial medical business effective January 1, 2018 . In addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense, receipts for premiums and services revenues, and amounts due under the risk limiting and health insurance industry fee provisions of the Health Care Reform Law, other items impacting operating cash flows include income tax payments and the timing of payroll cycles resulting in one less payroll cycle in 2016 than in 2015. 64 Cash Flow from Investing Activities Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $526 million in 2017 , $527 million in 2016 , and $523 million in 2015 . We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily investment-grade fixed income securities, totaling $2.4 billion in 2017 and $828 million in 2016 . Proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities exceeded purchases by $103 million in 2015 . These net proceeds were used to fund normal working capital needs due to an increase in receivables associated with the 3Rs in addition to the timing of payments to and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D reinsurance subsidies, as discussed below. In 2015, we purchased a $284 million note receivable directly from a third-party bank syndicate related to the financing of MCCI Holdings, LLC's business as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The purchase of this note is included with purchases of investment securities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. On June 1, 2015, we completed the sale of Concentra for approximately $1,055 million in cash, excluding approximately $22 million of transaction costs. Cash consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $31 million in 2017 , $7 million in 2016 , and $38 million in 2015 . Acquisitions in each year included Healthcare Services segment related acquisitions. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $1.9 billion higher than claims payments during 2017 and were $1.1 billion higher than claims payments during 2016 . Claim payments were $361 million higher than receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claims subsidies for which we do not assume risk during 2015 . In 2015, we experienced higher specialty prescription drug costs associated with a new treatment for Hepatitis C than were contemplated in our bids which resulted in higher subsidy receivable balances under the terms of our contracts with CMS. Our net payable for CMS subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to a net receivable of $0.9 billion at December 31, 2016 . Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Under our administrative services only TRICARE South Region contract, reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk by $11 million in 2017 . Health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by $25 million in 2016 and $4 million in 2015 . Claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the Health Care Reform Law for which we do not assume risk were higher than reimbursements from HHS by $44 million in 2017 and by $28 million in 2016 . Claim payments were less than reimbursements by $69 million in 2015 . See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further description. We repurchased 12.99 million shares for $3.05 billion in 2017 and 1.85 million shares for $329 million in 2015 under share repurchase plans authorized by the Board of Directors. We did not repurchase shares in 2016 due to restrictions under the Merger Agreement. We also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of $115 million in 2017 , $104 million in 2016 , and $56 million in 2015 . 65 As discussed further below, we paid dividends to stockholders of $220 million in 2017 , $177 million in 2016 , and $172 million in 2015 . We entered into a commercial paper program in October 2014. Net repayments of commercial paper were $153 million in 2017 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2017 was $500 million . Net repayments of commercial paper were $2 million in 2016 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2016 was $475 million . Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were $298 million in 2015 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2015 was $414 million . In March 2017, we issued $600 million of 3.95% senior notes due March 15, 2027 and $400 million of 4.80% senior notes due March 15, 2047. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discount and commission and offering expenses paid as of March 31, 2017, were $991 million . The net proceeds from these issuances are being used for general corporate purposes. In December 2017, we issued $400 million of 2.50% senior notes due December 15, 2020 and $400 million of 2.90% senior notes due December 15, 2022. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discount and commission and offering expenses paid as of December 31, 2017, were $794 million . We used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to fund the redemption of our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes maturing in August 2018 and our $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.20% senior notes maturing in June 2018 at 100% of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date , for cash totaling approximately $829 million . The remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Acquisitions & Divestitures On November 6, 2017 , we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary KMG to CGIC, a Texas-based insurance company wholly owned by HC2 Holdings, Inc., a diversified holding company. KMG subsidiary, KIC, includes our closed block of non-strategic commercial long-term care insurance policies. We will fund the transaction with approximately $203 million of parent company cash contributed into KMG, subject to customary adjustments, in addition to the transfer of approximately $150 million of statutory capital with the sale. The KMG transaction is anticipated to close by the third quarter of 2018 subject to customary closing conditions, including South Carolina Department of Insurance approval. There can be no assurance we will obtain regulatory approvals needed to sell the business or do so under terms acceptable to us. 66 On December 19, 2017, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 40% minority interest in the Kindred at Home Division (Kindred at Home) of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (Kindred)(NYSE: KND), the nation largest home health provider and second largest hospice operator, for estimated cash consideration of approximately $800 million , including our share of transaction and related expenses, to facilitate a complete separation from the Long Term Acute Care and Rehabilitation businesses (the Specialty Hospital company). The Kindred transaction, which is anticipated to close in the summer of 2018, is subject to customary state and federal regulatory approvals, including approval by the stockholders of Kindred and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, as well as other customary closing conditions. We expect to fund the transaction through the use of parent company cash and will account for the minority investment under the equity method. The pending transaction did not have a material impact to earnings in 2017. For a detailed discussion of the above please refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Liquidity Requirements We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares. Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2017 was BBB+ according to Standard & Poor Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa3 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $750 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $2 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $8 million. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Humana Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company decreased to $688 million at December 31, 2017 from $2.0 billion at December 31, 2016 . This decrease primarily reflects common stock repurchases, insurance subsidiaries' capital contributions and capital expenditures, partially offset by insurance subsidiaries dividends, non-insurance subsidiaries' profits and net proceeds from debt issuance. Our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our Healthcare Services segment, is generally not restricted by Departments of Insurance (or comparable state regulatory agencies). Our regulated subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of $1.4 billion in 2017 , $763 million in 2016 , and $493 million in 2015 . Subsidiary dividends in 2015 reflect the impact of losses for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the Health Care Reform Law and the November 5, 2015 revised statutory accounting guidance requiring the exclusion of risk corridor receivables from related statutory surplus. Refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in Schedule I - Parent Company Financial Information. Excluding Puerto Rico subsidiaries, the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2018 is approximately $1.1 billion , in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. Our parent company funded a subsidiary capital contribution of approximately $535 million in the first quarter of 2017 for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of long-term care insurance policies discussed further in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 67 Regulatory Requirements For a detailed discussion of our regulatory requirements, including aggregate statutory capital and surplus as well as dividends paid from the subsidiaries to the parent, please refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2017 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in millions) Debt $ 4,950 $ 150 $ 1,200 $ 600 $ 3,000 Interest (1) 3,021 200 379 347 2,095 Operating leases (2) 519 152 218 97 52 Purchase obligations (3) 429 226 188 15 Future policy benefits payable and other long-term liabilities (4) 3,396 91 482 208 2,615 Total $ 12,315 $ 819 $ 2,467 $ 1,267 $ 7,762 (1) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements. (2) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other furniture and equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2046 . We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased such asset, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (4) Includes future policy benefits payable ceded to third parties through 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We expect the assuming reinsurance carriers to fund these obligations and reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverables included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts payable in less than one year are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2017 , we were not involved in any special purpose entity, or SPE, transactions. For a detailed discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Guarantees and Indemnifications For a detailed discussion of our guarantees and indemnifications, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 68 Government Contracts For a detailed discussion of our government contracts, including our Medicare, Military, and Medicaid contracts, please refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Other On February 14, 2017, we and Aetna agreed to mutually terminate the Merger Agreement, as our Board determined that an appeal of the Court's ruling would not be in the best interest of our stockholders. On February 16, 2017, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we received a breakup fee of $1 billion . Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Benefits Expense Recognition Benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows: December 31, 2017 Percentage of Total December 31, 2016 Percentage of Total (dollars in millions) IBNR $ 3,154 67.6 % $ 3,422 75.0 % Reported claims in process 614 13.1 % 654 14.3 % Other benefits payable 900 19.3 % 487 10.7 % Total benefits payable $ 4,668 100.0 % $ 4,563 100.0 % Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. For further discussion of our reserving methodology, including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate IBNR, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 69 The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2017 data: Completion Factor (a): Claims Trend Factor (b): Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable Factor Change (c) Decrease in Benefits Payable (dollars in millions) 0.60% $(182) (2.75)% $(287) 0.50% $(152) (2.50)% $(261) 0.40% $(121) (2.25)% $(235) 0.30% $(91) (2.00)% $(209) 0.20% $(61) (1.75)% $(183) 0.10% $(30) (1.50)% $(157) % $ (1.25)% $(131) (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2017 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at December 31, 2017 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months. (c) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. The following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable, excluding military services. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for Retail, Group and Specialty, and Individual Commercial segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2017 , net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of IBNR included within the net incurred claims amounts. 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Balances at January 1 $ 4,563 $ 4,976 $ 4,475 Less: Premium deficiency reserve (176 ) Less: Reinsurance recoverables (76 ) (85 ) (78 ) Balances at January 1, net 4,487 4,715 4,397 Incurred related to: Current year 44,001 45,318 44,397 Prior years (483 ) (582 ) (236 ) Total incurred 43,518 44,736 44,161 Paid related to: Current year (39,496 ) (40,852 ) (39,802 ) Prior years (3,911 ) (4,112 ) (4,041 ) Total paid (43,407 ) (44,964 ) (43,843 ) Premium deficiency reserve 176 Reinsurance recoverable 70 76 85 Balances at December 31 $ 4,668 $ 4,563 $ 4,976 70 The following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments. Favorable Development by Changes in Key Assumptions 2017 2016 2015 Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) Amount Factor Change (a) (dollars in millions) Trend factors $ (279 ) (2.6 )% $ (316 ) (2.9 )% $ (145 ) (1.5 )% Completion factors (204 ) 0.7 % (266 ) 0.9 % (91 ) 0.4 % Total $ (483 ) $ (582 ) $ (236 ) (a) The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change. As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $483 million in 2017 , $582 million in 2016 , and $236 million in 2015 . The table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 . Favorable Medical Claims Reserve Development Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 (in millions) Retail Segment $ (386 ) $ (429 ) $ (248 ) $ 43 $ (181 ) Group and Specialty Segment (40 ) (46 ) (7 ) 6 (39 ) Individual Commercial Segment (56 ) (106 ) 20 50 (126 ) Other Businesses (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Total $ (483 ) $ (582 ) $ (236 ) $ 99 $ (346 ) The favorable medical claims reserve development for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. Because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our December 31, 2017 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table. 71 Benefits expense excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Premium deficiency reserve for short-duration policies $ $ (176 ) $ 176 Military services 8 12 Future policy benefits (22 ) 439 (80 ) Total $ (22 ) $ 271 $ 108 In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a premium deficiency reserve for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the Health Care Reform Law associated with the 2016 coverage year as discussed in more detail in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Military services benefits expense for each year in the table above reflect expenses associated with our contracts with the Veterans Administration. The higher benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable during 2016 primarily relates to reserve strengthening for our closed block of long-term care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 KMG acquisition as more fully described below and in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Certain health policies sold to individuals prior to 2014 (the first year plans compliant with the Health Care Reform Law were effective) are accounted for as long-duration as more fully described below. Benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable in 2015 primarily reflects the release of reserves as individual commercial medical members transitioned to plans compliant with the Health Care Reform Law. Future policy benefits payable of $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, represent liabilities for long-duration insurance policies including long-term care insurance, life insurance, annuities, and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. At policy issuance, these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on premium rate increase, interest rate, mortality, morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in-force), and maintenance expense assumptions. Interest rates are based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business. Mortality, a measure of expected death, and morbidity, a measure of health status, assumptions are based on published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. The assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is issued and only change if our expected future experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability, together with the present value of future gross premiums, are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs (i.e. the loss recognition date). Because these policies have long-term claim payout periods, there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs, either positive or negative. We perform loss recognition tests at least annually in the fourth quarter, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the level of the liability, together with the present value of future gross premiums, may not be adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs. Future policy benefits payable include $2.3 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016 associated with a non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 acquisition of KMG. Approximately 29,800 policies remain in force as of December 31, 2017 . No new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block. Future policy benefits payable includes amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income for an additional liability that would exist on our closed-block of long-term care insurance policies if unrealized gains on the sale of the investments backing such products had been realized and the proceeds reinvested at then current yields. There was a $168 million additional liability at December 31, 2017 and $77 million additional liability at December 31, 2016 . Amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income are net of applicable deferred taxes. 72 Long-term care insurance policies provide nursing home and home health coverage for which premiums are collected many years in advance of benefits paid, if any. Therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established. The risk of a deviation of the actual interest, morbidity, mortality, and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of long-term care insurance policies. A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligation under long term care policies because the long duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, we monitor the loss experience of these long-term care insurance policies and, when necessary, apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold. To the extent premium rate increases, interest rates, and/or loss experience vary from our loss recognition date assumptions, future material adjustments to reserves could be required. During 2016, we recorded a loss for a premium deficiency. The premium deficiency was based on current and anticipated experience that had deteriorated from our locked-in assumptions from the previous December 31, 2013 loss recognition date, particularly as they related to emerging experience indicating longer claims duration, a prolonged lower interest rate environment, and an increase in policyholder life expectancies. Based on this deterioration, we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable, together with the present value of future gross premiums, associated with our closed block of long-term care insurance policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits and maintenance costs under these policies; therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations. Accordingly, during 2016 we recorded $505 million of additional benefits expense, with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of $659 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of $154 million included in other long-term assets. For our closed block of long-term care policies, actuarial assumptions used to estimate reserves are inherently uncertain due to the potential changes in trends in mortality, morbidity, persistency and interest rates as well as premium rate increases. As a result, our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if these trends develop adversely to our expectations. The estimated increase in reserves and additional benefit expense from hypothetically modeling adverse variations in our actuarial assumptions, in the aggregate, could be up to $250 million , net of reinsurance. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently appropriate, we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectation of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur, and any such revision could be material. Generally accepted accounting principles do not allow us to unlock our assumptions for favorable items. In addition, future policy benefits payable includes amounts of $199 million at December 31, 2017 , $201 million at December 31, 2016 , and $205 million at December 31, 2015 which are subject to 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other long-term assets. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per employee basis for each month of coverage based on the type of coverage purchased (single to family coverage options). Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member. However, our Medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section. Premiums revenue and administrative services only, or ASO, fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay, and for estimated rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the Health Care Reform Law. Enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on 73 available data and historical trends. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period revenue. We bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. We receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. Changes in revenues from for our Medicare and commercial medical products resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Medicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions CMS utilizes a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health severity. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997(BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans. Rates paid to MA plans are established under an actuarial bid model, including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government Medicare FFS program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. CMS is phasing-in the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the Risk Adjustment Processing System, or RAPS, to diagnoses data from the Encounter Data System, or EDS. The RAPS process requires MA plans to apply a filter logic based on CMS guidelines and only submit claims that satisfy those guidelines. For submissions through EDS, CMS requires MA plans to submit all the encounter data and CMS will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores. For 2016, 10% of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through EDS, increasing to 25% of the risk score calculated from claims data through EDS for 2017. In April 2017, CMS revised the pace of the phase-in. For 2018, 15% of the risk score will be calculated from claims data submitted through EDS. The phase-in from RAPS to EDS could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues, CMS processing issues, or filtering logic differences between RAPS and EDS, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We estimate risk-adjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership. The risk-adjustment model, including CMS changes to the submission process, is more fully described in Item 1. Business under the section titled Individual Medicare. 74 Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $12.3 billion , or 45% of total assets at December 31, 2017 , and $9.8 billion , or 39% of total assets at December 31, 2016 . Debt securities, detailed below, comprised this entire investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . The fair value of debt securities were as follows at December 31, 2017 and 2016 : December 31, 2017 Percentage of Total December 31, 2016 Percentage of Total (dollars in millions) U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 531 4.3 % $ 786 8.0 % Mortgage-backed securities 1,610 13.1 % 1,637 16.7 % Tax-exempt municipal securities 3,889 31.6 % 3,305 33.7 % Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 26 0.2 % 9 0.1 % Commercial 456 3.7 % 304 3.1 % Asset-backed securities 408 3.3 % 160 1.7 % Corporate debt securities 5,382 43.8 % 3,597 36.7 % Total debt securities $ 12,302 100.0 % $ 9,798 100.0 % Approximately 98% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit rating of AA by S&P at December 31, 2017 . Most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated BB , the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Tax-exempt municipal securities included pre-refunded bonds of $222 million at December 31, 2017 and $276 million at December 31, 2016 . These pre-refunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of U.S. government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity. The ratings of these pre-refunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established. Tax-exempt municipal securities that were not pre-refunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of U.S. states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds. General obligation bonds, which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer, accounted for $1.8 billion of these municipals in the portfolio. Special revenue bonds, issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education, and supported by the revenues of that project, accounted for $1.9 billion of these municipals. Our general obligation bonds are diversified across the U.S. with no individual state exceeding 9% . In addition, certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our tax-exempt municipal securities. We have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers. We owned $94 million and $132 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, of tax-exempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers. The equivalent weighted average S&P credit rating of these tax-exempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was AA . Our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities backed by home equity loans. The fair value of securities backed by Alt-A and subprime loans was less than $1 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . There are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio. The percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 30% at December 31, 2017 and 23% at December 31, 2016 . 75 Gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at December 31, 2017 : Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses (in millions) December 31, 2017 U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies: U.S. Treasury and agency obligations $ 273 $ (1 ) $ 130 $ (1 ) $ 403 $ (2 ) Mortgage-backed securities 581 (2 ) 672 (17 ) 1,253 (19 ) Tax-exempt municipal securities 1,590 (16 ) 661 (12 ) 2,251 (28 ) Mortgage-backed securities: Residential 20 3 23 Commercial 131 (1 ) 28 (1 ) 159 (2 ) Asset-backed securities 107 10 117 Corporate debt securities 1,297 (10 ) 804 (27 ) 2,101 (37 ) Total debt securities $ 3,999 $ (30 ) $ 2,308 $ (58 ) $ 6,307 $ (88 ) Under the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis. However, if we do not intend to sell the debt security, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. When we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential other-than-temporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. A decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. There is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. 76 The recoverability of our non-agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities is supported by factors such as seniority, underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements. These residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2017 primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit support, with over 99% of the collateral consisting of prime loans. The weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgage-backed securities was AA+ at December 31, 2017 . All issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2017 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets than when the securities were purchased. At December 31, 2017 , we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. As a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2017 . There were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2017 , 2016 , or 2015 . Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2017 , goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 19% of total assets and 52% of total stockholders equity, compared to 20% and 47% , respectively, at December 31, 2016 . We are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. The carrying amount of goodwill for our reportable segments has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the 2017 segment change discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We use the one-step process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. We rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the Health Care Reform Law or changes in Government rates, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill, with the exception of our provider services reporting unit in our Healthcare Services segment. The provider services reporting unit, with $590 million of goodwill, would decline to less than 10% margin after factoring in a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. There were no material impairment losses in the last three years. 77
