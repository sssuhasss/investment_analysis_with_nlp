ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERVIEW Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: o Equine, pet and animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment o Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use o Hardware and tool products o Seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment o Truck, trailer and towing products, and o Work/recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family. Our stores currently range in size from approximately 7,000 to 28,000 square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space. We are developing stores using one of five standard prototypes as well as existing building structures. Our stores typically range in size from 15,500 square feet to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del's Farm Supply, LLC ("Del's"), operates 18 stores, primarily in the Pacific Northwest, that offer a wide selection of products (primarily in the equine, pet and animal category) tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del's stores currently range in size from approximately 1,500 to 7,000 square feet of inside selling space with additional outside selling space. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through aggressive merchandising and marketing programs with an "everyday low prices" philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through selective assortment, vendor price negotiation, sourcing and optimization of transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially occupancy, advertising and distribution, and (5) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth. We have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 22.8%. We plan to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in our unit count of approximately 13%. This growth has expanded our market presence into 37 states and one Canadian province. We believe the projected unit count increase, along with strategic relocations of stores into areas of greater retail opportunity, will contribute substantially to our future growth. The acquisition of Del's enabled us to establish an initial presence in the Pacific Northwest, primarily in Washington, with one store in British Columbia, Canada. We operated 676 retail farm and ranch stores as of December 30, 2006 and have plans to open 85 to 90 stores in fiscal 2007, and approximately 12 store relocations. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 750 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores (excluding Del's) in the United States. In addition, we continue to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores. We plan to relocate additional stores over the next several years. Our store relocations are typically undertaken to move small, older stores to full-size formats in improved retail areas. We have relocated 87 stores since 2001. We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. These efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store employees, have enhanced our sales and financial performance. SEASONALITY AND WEATHER Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive rain, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores. 14 <PAGE> We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season. INFLATION Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. Moreover, in the last few years, energy prices have risen dramatically, which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores. We have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation, principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management's discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION AND SALES RETURNS We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our layaway program), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete. Revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption. We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one-year rolling average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales. Our estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year, however, as with any estimates, refunds activity may vary from estimated amounts. INVENTORY VALUATION IMPAIRMENT RISK We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. SHRINKAGE Our stores perform physical inventories once a year and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. This is done by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. 15 <PAGE> VENDOR SUPPORT We receive funding from our vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold, which is in compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" ("EITF 02-16"). The amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we have the ability to reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding, it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the estimated amounts. FREIGHT We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS We have share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee directors. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments" using the modified prospective transition method. Among other items, SFAS 123(R) eliminates the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. As we adopted SFAS 123(R) under the modified-prospective-transition method, results from prior periods have not been restated. However, prior to adoption of SFAS 123(R), share-based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to fiscal 2006. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified BLACK-SCHOLES option pricing model. The BLACK-SCHOLES option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, key assumptions used in the BLACK-SCHOLES model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards. Option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected life. We rely on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions. Other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the BLACK-SCHOLES model are the expected risk-free interest rate and expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury zero-coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options. In addition to the key assumptions used in the BLACK-SCHOLES model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. We adjust this estimate annually, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate. We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of actual (historical) experience. The impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) on future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based payments granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises. 16 <PAGE> SALES TAX RESERVE A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex environment of compliance. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities. INSURANCE RESERVES We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values ($200,000 for employee health insurance claims, $350,000 for workers' compensation and $250,000 for general liability). The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Therefore, we estimate potential obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data, experience, and use of outside actuarial consultants. Although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2006 and 2005 are shown below (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): <TABLE> <CAPTION> FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2006 QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER TOTAL - ---- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- --------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Net sales ............... $ 465,547 $ 714,944 $ 559,222 $ 629,899 $2,369,612 Gross margin ............ 142,284 227,385 176,340 205,354 751,363 Income from operations .. 1,741 68,931 29,103 48,245 148,020 Net income .............. 525 42,927 18,059 29,497 91,008 Net income per share: (1) Basic ................. $ 0.01 $ 1.07 $ 0.45 $ 0.73 $ 2.27 Diluted ............... $ 0.01 $ 1.05 $ 0.44 $ 0.72 $ 2.22 Same-store sales increase 3.7% 0.5% 2.4% 0.5% 1.6% 2005(2) - ---- Net sales ............... $ 377,203 $ 613,235 $ 479,607 $ 597,934 $2,067,979 Gross margin ............ 112,071 189,756 146,905 190,819 639,551 Income from operations .. 1,750 56,308 28,939 49,447 136,444 Net income .............. 684 35,754 18,329 30,902 85,669 Net income per share: Basic ................. $ 0.02 $ 0.92 $ 0.47 $ 0.78 $ 2.19 Diluted ............... $ 0.02 $ 0.87 $ 0.45 $ 0.75 $ 2.09 Same-store sales increase 4.2% 5.9% 1.8% 10.0% 5.7% </TABLE> - ----------------------------------- (1) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year. (2) The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is comprised of 14 weeks while all other quarters presented for both years are comprised of 13 weeks. 17 <PAGE> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 contains 53 weeks while the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006 and December 25, 2004 contain 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2006 2005 2004 ----- ------ ----- Net sales..................................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of merchandise sold...................... 68.3 69.1 69.8 ----- ------ ----- Gross margin.................................. 31.7 30.9 30.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses.. 23.7 22.7 22.8 Depreciation and amortization................. 1.8 1.6 1.6 ----- ----- ----- Income from operations........................ 6.2 6.6 5.8 Interest expense, net......................... 0.1 0.1 0.1 ----- ----- ----- Income before income taxes.................... 6.1 6.5 5.7 Income tax provision.......................... 2.3 2.4 2.0 ----- ----- ----- Net income 3.8% 4.1% 3.7% ===== ===== ===== FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Net sales increased 14.6% to $2,369.6 million in fiscal 2006 from $2,068.0 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 included an additional week of sales which impacted the current year sales increase by 1.5%. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 1.6%. Our average transaction value increased 2.6% to $43.12 and same-store transaction value increased 0.8% for fiscal 2006. Average daily transaction count per store decreased 2.9% to 238, while same-store transaction count increased 0.7%. Same-store sales improvements of 1.6% compared to 5.7% in the prior year were strongest in the clothing/footwear and equine/pet/animal categories, but were partially offset by lower than expected performance in seasonal power equipment, generators and cold weather-related products, including insulated outerwear, snow removal and heating. In fiscal 2006, we opened 82 new stores (compared to 65 new stores and the acquisition of 16 Del's stores in fiscal 2005), relocated 15 stores (compared to 18 in fiscal 2005) and closed one store (compared to one closure in fiscal 2005). As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 80 basis points to 31.7% for fiscal 2006 from 30.9% for fiscal 2005. Gross margin was primarily impacted by a more favorable product mix, increased importing and improved inventory shrinkage. During the year, we refined our method of estimating the freight cost component of inventory based on changes in our business and operating environment which included a change in mix of goods, an increased level of importing and rapidly increasing fuel costs. This refinement provides a more appropriate matching of freight cost incurred with inventory and cost of merchandise sold. This change in estimate increased the inventory value and reduced the freight component of cost of merchandise sold by approximately $2.9 million for fiscal 2006. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 100 basis points to 23.7% in fiscal 2006 from 22.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy costs and a charge of $9.7 million (or 0.4% of sales) related to stock compensation expense. During the year, we refined our method of estimating the amount of gift cards sold that will ultimately go unredeemed. Our estimate was based on an analysis of gift card sale and redemption patterns across an extended historical timeline. We accordingly recognized a benefit of $2.4 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the $2.4 million recognized in fiscal 2006, $2.1 million (or 0.1% of sales) was due to a modification of the redemption assumptions based on an analysis of historical redemption patterns. This benefit has been included as a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses and is reflected as a reduction of other accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 18 <PAGE> Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)") using the modified prospective method and began recognizing compensation expense for share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards. Share-based payments include stock option grants and certain transactions under our other stock plans. SFAS 123(R) requires share-based compensation expense recognized since the beginning of fiscal 2006 to be based on the following: a) grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date; b) grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted subsequent to the adoption date; and c) the discount on shares sold to employees post-adoption, which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the employee purchase price. For fiscal 2006, the adoption of the SFAS 123(R) fair value method resulted in additional compensation expense (a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) related to our stock plans that we would not have recognized had we continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25. For fiscal 2006, this share-based compensation expense lowered pre-tax income by $9.7 million and net income by $6.1 million. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 24.3% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores and remodeled existing stores. Net interest expense increased 64.7% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. This increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2006 and interest incurred as the result of federal and sales tax audits; partially offset by a reduction in average long-term borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2006 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2005, resulting primarily from a higher effective income tax rate due to the non-deductibility of certain stock compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS123(R). As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2006 increased 6.2% to $91.0 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, which includes a $9.7 million charge, or $0.15 per diluted share, in stock compensation expense. This compares to net income of $85.7 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Net sales increased 18.9% to $2,068.0 million in fiscal 2005 from $1,738.8 million in fiscal 2004. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores (including 16 additional stores from the acquisition of Del's) as well as a same-store sales improvement of 5.7%. Fiscal 2005 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2004, which accounted for approximately 1.8% of the sales increase. Our average transaction value increased 5.5% to $42.03 and same-store average transaction value increased 4.3% for fiscal 2005. Average daily transactions per store decreased 1.2% to 245, while same-store transaction count increased 1.4%. The same-store sales increase includes an approximate 1.2% gain for fiscal 2005 which is attributed to increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel and petroleum-related product costs. Same-store transaction count increases were generally experienced across all product lines, with seasonal products representing the strongest category. In fiscal 2005, we opened 65 new stores (compared to 53 in fiscal 2004), acquired an additional 16 Del's stores, relocated 18 stores (compared to 20 in fiscal 2004) and closed one store (compared to one in fiscal 2004). As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 76 basis points to 30.9% for fiscal 2005 from 30.2% for fiscal 2004. Gross margin was primarily impacted by overall lower product costs partially offset by higher than anticipated transportation costs (caused primarily by increased diesel fuel costs and overall capacity demands on the transportation industry). As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were comparable at 22.7% and 22.8% for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 25.1% in fiscal 2005 over fiscal year 2004 due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores, remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities. 19 <PAGE> Net interest expense increased 13.3% in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in fiscal 2005 partially offset by a reduction in average long-term borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement. Our effective tax rate was 36.5% for fiscal 2005 compared to 36.0% in fiscal 2004, resulting primarily from a higher effective state income tax rate due to the mix of business by state. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2005 increased 33.7% to $85.7 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared to net income of $64.1 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations, commitments available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively. WORKING CAPITAL At December 30, 2006, we had working capital of $316.1 million, a $75.4 million increase from December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2006 2005 VARIANCE ------ ------ -------- <S> <C> <C> <C> CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents ............... $ 37.6 $ 21.2 $ 16.4 Inventories ............................. 593.4 460.8 132.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 37.0 38.4 (1.4) Other, net .............................. 11.3 11.0 0.3 ------ ------ ------ 679.3 531.4 147.9 ------ ------ ------ CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable ........................ $ 238.9 $ 185.4 $ 53.5 Accrued expenses ........................ 111.7 102.8 8.9 Income taxes payable .................... 11.5 1.4 10.1 Other, net .............................. 1.1 1.1 (0.0) ------ ------ ------ 363.2 290.7 72.5 ------ ------ ------ WORKING CAPITAL ........................... $ 316.1 $ 240.7 $ 75.4 ====== ====== ====== </TABLE> The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to increased cash generated from results of operations in fiscal 2006. The increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from the purchase of inventory for new stores, new merchandising initiatives and the addition of inventory due to a new (larger) distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska. We also experienced increased inventory levels in many stores as the result of softer than anticipated sales for the fourth quarter, and planned improvements in our overall in-stock position at the store level. We experienced a 15 basis point decrease in inventory turns (approximately 2.67 times per year), which contributed to a decrease in our financed inventory from approximately 39.0% to 37.1%. (The calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory, excludes in-transit inventories and includes unopened stores). Trade credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to increases in the scale of our business volume, the timing of the accruals and the related payment of those accruals. The increase in income taxes payable resulted from increased income and the timing of estimated tax payments. 20 <PAGE> BORROWINGS AND CREDIT FACILITIES In August 2002, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the "Credit Agreement"), allowing us to borrow up to $155 million. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended on January 28, 2004 and September 30, 2004 and replaced on February 22, 2007 (see below). Both amendments included changes to certain financial covenants, primarily to provide flexibility for capital expenditures, and extended the maturity to February 27, 2008. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 30, 2006 and $8.2 million was outstanding at December 31, 2005. The balance of funds available under the Credit Agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up to $50 million for letters of credit, of which $24.9 million and $12.1 million were outstanding at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank's base rate (8.25% at December 30, 2006) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") (5.32% at December 30, 2006) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.75% to 1.5% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.75% at December 30, 2006). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% per annum (0.20% at December 30, 2006) and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, on the average daily unused portion of the credit line. There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. In addition, we must comply with certain quarterly restrictions (based on a rolling four-quarters basis) regarding net worth, leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage, current ratio requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006. In February 2007, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the same lender group as under the Credit Agreement. The new Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to $250 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively). This agreement is unsecured and has a five-year term, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. Borrowings will bear interest at either the bank's base rate or LIBOR plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.50% at February, 2007). We will also be required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum for unused capacity. This new agreement eliminates the capital expenditures, net worth and current ratio requirements from the previous Credit Agreement and requires quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios. SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing and financing activities are capital expenditures and payments on debt, respectively. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2006 2005 2004 ------- ------- ------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Net cash provided by operating activities ............... $ 87.1 $ 99.2 $ 77.1 Net cash used in investing activities ................... (80.8) (90.7) (87.3) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities ..... 10.1 (16.2) 19.2 ------- ------- ------- Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 16.4 $ (7.7) $ 9.0 ======= ======= ======= </TABLE> 21 <PAGE> OPERATING ACTIVITIES The $12.1 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2006 2005 VARIANCE ------ ------ -------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Net income ........................... $ 91.0 $ 85.7 $ 5.3 Tax benefit of stock options exercised -- 12.5 (12.5) Depreciation and amortization ........ 42.3 34.0 8.3 Stock compensation expense ........... 9.7 -- 9.7 Deferred income taxes ................ (3.5) (12.7) 9.2 Inventories and accounts payable ..... (79.1) (34.9) (44.2) Accrued expenses ..................... 8.8 12.8 (4.0) Income taxes currently payable ....... 10.1 1.4 8.7 Other, net ........................... 7.8 0.4 7.4 ------- ------- ----- Net cash provided by operations . $ 87.1 $ 99.2 $ (12.1) ======= ======= ===== </TABLE> The decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the net increase in inventory and accounts payable (as discussed in the Working Capital section), partially offset by an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items. The $22.1 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 was primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2006 2005 VARIANCE ------ ------ -------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Net income .............................. $ 85.7 $ 64.1 $ 21.6 Depreciation and amortization ........... 34.0 27.2 6.8 Deferred income taxes ................... (12.7) (4.6) (8.1) Inventories and accounts payable ........ (34.9) (44.2) 9.3 Prepaid expenses and other current assets (7.1) (2.2) (4.9) Accrued expenses ........................ 12.8 20.2 (7.4) Other, net .............................. 21.4 16.6 4.8 ------- ------- ----- Net cash provided by operations .... $ 99.2 $ 77.1 $ 22.1 ======= ======= ===== </TABLE> The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the increase in net income (exclusive of depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes), and a net decrease in inventory and accounts payable. Increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a relative decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the growth in cash provided by operations. These increases were primarily due to the growth in our business during fiscal 2005 and the timing of payments. INVESTING ACTIVITIES Investing activities used $80.8 million, $90.7 million, and $87.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures and, in fiscal 2005, the acquisition of the assets of Del's. Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, required the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2006 2005 2004 ------- ------- ------- <S> <C> <C> <C> New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $54,111 $40,525 $30,758 Existing stores .................................. 30,547 13,936 10,033 Distribution center capacity and improvements .... 2,302 19,585 41,024 Information technology ........................... 3,003 4,100 9,105 Corporate and other .............................. 602 689 2,069 ------- ------- ------- $90,565 $78,835 $92,989 ======= ======= ======= </TABLE> 22 <PAGE> Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people. The costs reflected below are typically building improvements, as we lease the majority of our facilities. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million in fiscal 2007. FINANCING ACTIVITIES Financing activities provided $10.1 million, used $16.2 million, and provided $19.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Excluding the tax benefit recognized in 2006 as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R), financing activities in fiscal 2006 would have been $0.6 million. The cash provided by financing activities is largely net cash provided as a result of borrowings required by operations, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs. We believe that our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the new Senior Credit Facility, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years. SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 30, 2006 (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD -------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL CONTRACTUAL LESS THAN MORE THAN OBLIGATIONS 1 YEAR 1-3 YEARS 4-5 YEARS 5 YEARS ----------- --------- ---------- ---------- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Operating leases ......... $967,383 $103,816 $194,031 $173,543 $495,993 Capital leases(1)......... 6,210 1,330 1,503 583 2,794 Purchase obligations(2)... 7,571 7,571 -- -- -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- $981,164 $112,717 $195,534 $174,126 $498,787 ======== ======== ======== ======== ======== </TABLE> - ---------------------------- (1) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in 2007. The Company had outstanding standby letters of credit of $24.9 million as of December 30, 2006. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The extent of our off-balance sheet arrangements is operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allow us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner. KNOWN TRENDS, EVENTS, DEMANDS, COMMITMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES LITIGATION We are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, we expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings. In July 2004, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee by the Hawaii Laborers Pension Plan against each of our directors, certain of our officers and one former 23 <PAGE> director. We were named as a nominal defendant. On December 3, 2004, the Court granted our motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice. Although the plaintiff filed subsequent appellate motions, all were dismissed. All applicable statutes of limitations have run, concluding the matter in our favor. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. We adopted SFAS 123R in fiscal 2006, as required (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). HOW TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT In March 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06-3, "How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)", which allows companies to adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis. Taxes within the scope of this EITF would include taxes that are imposed on a revenue transaction between a seller and a customer, for example, sales taxes, use taxes, value-added taxes, and some types of excise taxes. EITF 06-3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2007. EITF 06-3 will not impact the method for recording and reporting these sales taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements as our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue. ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48") to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions that meet a "more-likely-than-not" recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized. We will adopt FIN 48 in fiscal 2007, as required. We currently estimate a charge to retained earnings of approximately $2 million to be recognized as the cumulative effect of adoption. Additionally, we anticipate the adoption of this pronouncement will increase our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2007 by approximately 60 basis points.
