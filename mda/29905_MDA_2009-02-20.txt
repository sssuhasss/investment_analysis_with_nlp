Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which appear elsewhere in the Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS inside the front cover of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (1) FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Management assesses the Company liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 1,010,416 $ 927,693 Investing activities (452,994 ) (332,102 ) Financing activities (560,904 ) (345,673 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2008 increased $82.7 million over the prior year primarily reflecting higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization, lower tax payments in 2008 and lower receivables, partially offset by higher pension contributions. Cash used in investing activities during 2008 increased $120.9 million compared to 2007, largely due to the purchase of short-term investments, partially offset by lower spending on acquisitions in 2008. Acquisition expenditures in 2008 were $103.8 million compared to $273.6 million in 2007, while proceeds from the disposition of businesses were essentially flat at $92.8 million, up $1.8 million from $91.0 million in 2007. Capital expenditures of $175.8 million were generally consistent with the prior year level of $173.7 million. The Company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2009 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, established lines of credit or public debt markets. Capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to be approximately 30% to 40% below 2008 levels. Cash used in financing activities during 2008 increased $215.2 million compared to 2007 reflecting higher repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt, partially offset by $594.1 million in proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt and lower cash spent on share repurchases in the 2008 period. Share Repurchases During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 10,000,000 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $46.15 per share. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had completed the purchases of all shares authorized under its $500 million share repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2007. 19 Table of Contents During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Board of Directors approved two separate share repurchase programs authorizing repurchases of approximately 20,000,000 common shares through the end of 2008. The Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement on August 2, 2007 ( ASR ) under which it purchased 6,000,000 shares of its common stock at an initial purchase price of $51.64 per share. Upon final settlement of this ASR in the fourth quarter of 2007, the final economic purchase price was $48.36 per share, representing an average of the volume weighted average price of the Company common stock during the outstanding period less a negotiated discount amount. In addition, during 2007, the Company made other open market purchases of its common stock totaling 6.4 million shares at an average price of $46.78 per share. Adjusted Working Capital Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) decreased from the prior year end by $86.0 million, or 6%, to $1,275.9 million which reflected a decrease in receivables of $91.0 million, a decrease in inventory of $37.8 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $42.8 million. Excluding acquisitions of $18.4 million, dispositions of ($9.6) million and the effects of foreign exchange translation of ($38.5) million, Adjusted Working Capital would have decreased by $56.3 million, or 4%. Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) decreased to 18.3% at December 31, 2008 from 18.9% at December 31, 2007 and inventory turns were 7.1 at December 31, 2008 compared to 6.7 at December 31, 2007. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase Dover common stock. For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $834.6 million or 11.0% of revenue compared to $754.0 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior year. The 2008 increase in free cash flow reflected higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments in 2008 and lower receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher pension contributions. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities: Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow 2008 2007 (In thousands) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 1,010,416 $ 927,693 Less: Capital expenditures 175,795 173,653 Free cash flow $ 834,621 $ 754,040 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 11.0 % 10.3 % At December 31, 2008, the Company net property, plant, and equipment totaled $872.1 million compared to $892.2 million at the end of 2007. The decrease in net property, plant and equipment reflected depreciation and disposals, partially offset by capital expenditures of $175.8 million, acquisitions of $5.0 million and $17.0 million related to foreign currency fluctuations. The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a $241.2 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of $240.7 million at year-end 2008. This resulted primarily from a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and pension assets, partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and accrued expenses. Dover consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits decreased by $16.9 million in 2008. The decrease was due primarily to currency rate changes partially offset by actuarial losses. In 2008, plan assets decreased by $94.7 million primarily due to losses on plan investments and currency fluctuations during 20 Table of Contents the year, partially offset by Company and employee contributions. It is estimated that the Company defined and supplemental retirement benefits expense will increase from $35.7 million in 2008 to approximately $36.4 million in 2009. The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: At December 31, At December 31, Net Debt to Total Capitalization Ratio 2008 2007 (In thousands) Current maturities of long-term debt $ 32,194 $ 33,175 Commercial paper and other short-term debt 192,750 605,474 Long-term debt 1,860,729 1,452,003 Total debt 2,085,673 2,090,652 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 826,869 606,105 Net debt 1,258,804 1,484,547 Add: Stockholders equity 3,792,866 3,946,173 Total capitalization $ 5,051,670 $ 5,430,720 Net debt to total capitalization 24.9 % 27.3 % The total debt level of $2,085.7 million at December 31, 2008 decreased $5.0 million from December 31, 2007 due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings partially offset by an increase in long-term debt. Net debt at December 31, 2008 decreased $225.7 million as a result of higher cash generated from operations. The percentage decrease in net debt to total capital, after $462 million of share repurchases, reflects strong free cash flow and proceeds from dispositions of $92.8 million. Dover long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,892.9 million on December 31, 2008 and a fair value of approximately $2,018.5 million. On December 31, 2007, the Company long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,485.2 million and a fair value of approximately $1,496.0 million. The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase the Company debt. However, management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Company various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Management is not aware of any potential impairment to the Company liquidity. Under the Company $1 billion 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, which expires in November of 2012, the Company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The Company was in compliance with this covenant and its other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2008 and had a coverage ratio of 13.5 to 1. It is anticipated that in 2009 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper. Given the current economic conditions, the Company fully expects to remain in compliance with all of its debt covenants. The Company periodically enters into financial transactions specifically to hedge its exposures to various items, including, but not limited to, interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk. Through various programs, the Company hedges its cash flow exposures to foreign exchange rate risk by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts and collars. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial instruments. 21 Table of Contents During the first quarter of 2008, Dover entered into several interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt financing completed on March 14, 2008 which, upon settlement, resulted in a net gain of $1.2 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the lives of the related notes. There is presently one outstanding swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50.0 million, or CHF65.1 million, which swaps the U.S. 6-month LIBOR rate and the Swiss Franc 6-month LIBOR rate. This agreement hedges a portion of the Company net investment in non-U.S. operations and the fair value outstanding at December 31, 2008 was a loss of $12.0 million which was based on quoted market prices for similar instruments (uses Level 2 inputs under the SFAS No. 157 hierarchy). This hedge is effective. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the quarter in anticipation of a potential acquisition, which did not occur. As a result of terminating the hedge, the Company recorded a gain of $2.4 million in the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through December 2009 related to fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures. The fair values of these contracts were based on quoted market prices for identical instruments as of December 31, 2008 (uses Level 1 inputs under the SFAS No. 157 hierarchy). The details of the open contracts as of December 31, 2008 are as follows: US Dollars Sold Expiration From 12/31/08 Less Than 1 Average Forward Currencies Purchased Month 2-3 Months 4-6 Months 7-12 Months Contract Rate (In thousands) Great Britain Pounds $ $ 35,107 $ $ 1.4867 Euros 85,558 1.3885 Singapore Dollars 566 1.5015 Chinese Yuan 2,320 5,200 9,840 21,520 6.6915 Collar Put Call US Dollar Value US Dollar to Euro 1.460 1.526 $ 3,000 Maturities from 3/2009 12/2009 The Company credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 Short term Long term Short term Long term Moody P-1 A2 P-1 A2 Standard & Poor A-1 A A-1 A Fitch F1 A F1 A 22 Table of Contents A summary of the Company undiscounted long-term debt, commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2008 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 More than Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Other(A) (In thousands) Long-term debt $ 1,892,923 $ 32,194 $ 472,281 $ 271 $ 1,388,177 $ Interest expense 1,504,984 105,625 188,500 159,250 1,051,609 Rental commitments 189,665 46,144 64,009 37,788 41,724 Purchase obligations 28,023 27,381 57 585 Capital leases 16,017 2,429 4,666 3,706 5,216 Supplemental & post-retirement benefits 127,000 34,000 21,000 20,000 52,000 Uncertain tax positions(A) 249,553 22,171 227,382 Other long-term obligations 1,234 165 267 218 584 Total obligations $ 4,009,399 $ 270,109 $ 750,780 $ 221,233 $ 2,539,895 $ 227,382 (A) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, management is unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2009. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. Severance and Exit Reserves From time to time, the Company will initiate various restructuring programs at its operating companies or record severance and exit costs in connection with purchase accounting for acquisitions. During the latter half of 2008, the Company announced plans to increase the amount of restructuring efforts in response to the significant decline in global economic activity. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had reserves related to severance and exit activities of $31.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively. During 2008, the Company recorded $27.4 million in additional charges and $5.6 million in purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions, partially offset by other non-cash write-downs of $2.3 million and payments of $28.1 million. These costs yielded a savings of approximately $35.0 million in 2008. The Company expects further restructuring plans to occur in 2009 resulting in costs of approximately $40.0 million that the Company expects will yield savings of approximately $75.0 million in 2009. Restructuring charges are recorded primarily in Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. (2) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 3% over 2007, due to increases of $232.0 million at Fluid Management, $52.2 million at Industrial Products and $6.0 million at Electronic Technologies. These revenue increases were due to positive market fundamentals and acquisitions at Fluid Management, while Engineered Systems revenue decreased $41.7 million due to weakness in markets served by the Engineered Products platform. Overall, Dover organic revenue growth was 1%, net acquisition growth was 1% and the impact from foreign exchange was 1%. Gross profit increased 4% to $2,730.0 million from 2007 while the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 36.1% and 35.8%, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses of $1,700.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $86.7 million over the comparable 2007 period, primarily due to increased revenue activity, increased professional fees and restructuring charges. 23 Table of Contents Interest expense, net, increased 7% to $96.0 million for 2008, compared to $89.6 million for 2007 due to higher average outstanding borrowings used to fund purchases of the Company common stock and higher average commercial paper rates. Other expense (income), net for 2008 and 2007 of ($12.7) million and $3.5 million, respectively, was driven primarily by foreign exchange gains and losses, partially offset by other miscellaneous income. The 2008 and 2007 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.6% in both periods, each favorably impacted by the mix of non-U.S. earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions. Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 were $590.8 million or $3.12 EPS, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS, compared to net earnings of $661.1 million or $3.26 EPS for the same period of 2007, including a loss from discontinued operations of $8.7 million or $0.04 EPS. The losses from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflect a loss provision for a business expected to be sold in 2009, as well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing Federal tax settlements and state tax assessments. Refer to Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations. Current Economic Environment With few exceptions, Dover experienced lower demand across all of its end markets resulting in lower bookings and backlog in the fourth quarter of 2008. Looking forward to 2009, a continuation of a weak and uncertain global business environment is expected. Though this downturn will have a significant adverse impact on revenue and earnings, Dover remains committed to maintaining margin levels as much as possible on a full year basis, although the Company expects the first quarter to be weak, in part due to significant ongoing restructuring efforts. The structural changes made over the last few years, becoming less dependent on capital goods markets and having greater recurring revenue, together with improved working capital management and strong pricing discipline is expected to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn during 2009. As discussed above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, the Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates. The Company synergy capture programs and the restructuring initiatives launched during 2008 will continue into 2009. During 2008, Dover reduced its workforce approximately 6% and expects to reduce its workforce further in 2009 by another 5%. During 2009, the Company will monitor business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity as necessary should the economic environment worsen. The Company will also remain focused on working capital levels and expects to generate strong free cash flow during 2009. 24 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Industrial Products Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Material Handling $ 1,136,869 $ 1,145,253 (1 )% Mobile Equipment 1,323,422 1,262,984 5 % Eliminations (786 ) (977 ) $ 2,459,505 $ 2,407,260 2 % Segment earnings $ 299,740 $ 312,486 (4 )% Operating margin 12.2 % 13.0 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 32,283 $ 27,830 16 % Bookings Material Handling $ 1,109,028 $ 1,141,955 (3 )% Mobile Equipment 1,177,880 1,364,340 (14 )% Eliminations (1,134 ) (1,556 ) $ 2,285,774 $ 2,504,739 (9 )% Backlog Material Handling $ 188,591 $ 213,653 (12 )% Mobile Equipment 387,329 543,776 (29 )% Eliminations (220 ) (195 ) $ 575,700 $ 757,234 (24 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Industrial Products increase in revenue over the prior year was primarily due to strength in the military and solid waste management markets as well as the impact of the December 2007 acquisition of Industrial Motion Control LLC ( IMC ) and the March 2008 acquisition of Lantec Winch and Gear Inc. Overall, the segment had 2% revenue growth from its core businesses and acquisition growth of 3%, which was partially offset by the sale of a line of business. Earnings declined 4% when compared to the prior year substantially due to weakness in the construction and the North American auto service markets, and restructuring costs. Material Handling revenue decreased 1% while earnings decreased 5% when compared to the prior year. Revenue and earnings growth in the industrial winch business was more than offset by softness in the infrastructure, industrial automation and automotive markets. In addition, the platform incurred additional expenses related to its ongoing cost reduction and integration activities. Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 5% and 2%, respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase was primarily due to core business growth as the platform continued to experience strength in the aerospace, military and solid waste management markets. Softness in the automotive service and bulk transport end markets partially offset the increases experienced in other markets. 25 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Engineered Products $ 1,085,881 $ 1,139,478 (5 )% Product Identification 924,469 912,580 1 % $ 2,010,350 $ 2,052,058 (2 )% Segment earnings $ 278,553 $ 291,727 (5 )% Operating margin 13.9 % 14.2 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 24,394 $ 29,262 (17 )% Bookings Engineered Products $ 1,043,873 $ 1,116,638 (7 )% Product Identification 920,712 919,216 % $ 1,964,585 $ 2,035,854 (4 )% Backlog Engineered Products $ 183,821 $ 227,523 (19 )% Product Identification 61,195 68,938 (11 )% $ 245,016 $ 296,461 (17 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Engineered Systems decreases in revenue and earnings over the prior year of 2% and 5%, respectively, were primarily driven by the Engineered Products platform. Overall, the segment had a 4% decline in revenue from its core businesses which was partially offset by the favorable impact of currency rates of 2%. Engineered Products revenue and earnings decreased 5% and 15%, respectively, over the prior year due to weaker sales of retail food equipment and softness in the beverage can equipment business. In addition to the reduction in overall sales volume during the year, the platform earnings were negatively impacted by currency exchange rates, restructuring and a $6.6 million one-time charge primarily related to inventory. Partially offsetting these declines were the results of the heat exchanger and foodservice businesses which experienced continued strength throughout 2008. Product Identification platform revenue and earnings both increased 1% over 2007. The revenue growth was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange as the core businesses in the platform experienced lower volume. Despite the decline in core business revenue, the platform was able to maintain margins consistent with the prior year due to on-going integration activities across the platform. 26 Table of Contents Fluid Management Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Energy $ 935,414 $ 775,024 21 % Fluid Solutions 778,812 707,113 10 % Eliminations (180 ) (129 ) $ 1,714,046 $ 1,482,008 16 % Segment earnings $ 385,317 $ 304,576 27 % Operating margin 22.5 % 20.6 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 19,550 $ 15,569 26 % Bookings Energy $ 964,517 $ 785,065 23 % Fluid Solutions 771,359 716,644 8 % Eliminations (178 ) (110 ) $ 1,735,698 $ 1,501,599 16 % Backlog Energy $ 95,532 $ 88,245 8 % Fluid Solutions 64,471 73,713 (13 )% Eliminations (12 ) (14 ) $ 159,991 $ 161,944 (1 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Fluid Management revenue and earnings increased 16% and 27%, respectively, over 2007 due to strength in the oil, gas, and power generation sectors served by the Energy platform as well as the diverse markets served by the Fluid Solutions platform. Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 12%, acquisition growth of 3%, with the remainder due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The Energy platform revenue increased 21% while its earnings improved 32%, when compared to 2007, due to strength in the oil and gas markets and increasing power generation demand. Earnings and margin benefited from the higher volume and operational improvements. The Fluid Solutions platform revenue increased 10% and earnings improved 20% due to acquisitions and strength in the markets served by its core businesses. In general, demand remained strong for pumps, dispensing systems, and connectors. Earnings and margins improved due to a favorable business mix and cost savings from the platform ongoing cost reduction activities. 27 Table of Contents Electronic Technologies Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,396,131 $ 1,390,103 % Segment earnings $ 193,641 $ 180,337 7 % Operating margin 13.9 % 13.0 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 36,481 $ 38,296 (5 )% Bookings 1,342,382 1,378,551 (3 )% Backlog 175,317 232,704 (25 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Electronic Technologies revenue was flat while earnings increased 7% when compared to the prior year. Revenue increases in the micro-acoustic component business were offset by a softening in the other markets served by the segment resulting in a 3% decline in core business revenue excluding favorable foreign exchange rates. The segment earnings benefited from the increased volume in the micro-acoustic component business, a $7.5 million gain from the sale of a line of business (semi-conductor test handling), and cost savings from restructuring activities that were implemented in the first quarter of 2008. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 14% over 2006, due to increases of $485.1 million at Engineered Systems, $283.9 million at Industrial Products and $152.4 million at Fluid Management. These revenue increases were due to positive market fundamentals and acquisitions, while Electronic Technologies revenue decreased $21.5 million due to weakness in its markets. Overall, Dover organic revenue growth was 2.4%, acquisition growth was 9.5% and the impact from foreign exchange was 2.1%. Gross profit increased 14% to $2,619.5 million from 2006 while the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 35.8% and 35.7% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses of $1,614.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $224.8 million over the comparable 2006 period, primarily due to increased revenue and increases in compensation and pension benefit costs. Interest expense, net, increased 16% to $89.6 million for 2007, compared to $77.0 million for 2006 due to higher average outstanding borrowings used to fund purchases of the Company common stock and average commercial paper rates. Other expense (income), net for 2007 and 2006 of $3.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively, was driven primarily by foreign exchange losses, partially offset by other miscellaneous income. The 2007 and 2006 tax rates for continuing operations were 26.6%, and 26.9%, respectively. Both periods were favorably impacted by the mix of non-U.S. earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions. Earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were $669.8 million or $3.30 EPS compared to $595.7 million or $2.90 EPS in 2006. For 2007, net earnings were $661.1 million, or $3.26 EPS, which included an $8.7 million, or $0.04 EPS, loss from discontinued operations, compared to $561.8 million, or $2.73 EPS for 2006, which included a $33.9 million, or $0.16 EPS, loss from discontinued operations.

Industrial Products revenue and earnings increases over the prior year were primarily the result of the acquisition of Paladin in August 2006 and the July 2007 acquisition of Hanmecson International, a Chinese manufacturer of vehicle lifts. For the year, the segment achieved 1% organic growth, while growth from acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange accounted for 11% and 1%, respectively. Material Handling revenue increased 27% while earnings increased 26% compared to the prior year. The increases were primarily due to the Paladin acquisition and improvements in the heavy winch, recreational vehicle and industrial automation businesses. Margin was impacted by the slowdown in the heavy construction business producing attachments and cylinders. In addition, the platform benefited from new product introductions, plant rationalization and global sourcing during 2007. Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 3% and 8%, respectively, over the prior year. The platform results benefited from the Hanmecson acquisition and core growth at businesses in the petroleum, crude oil and military markets, as well as a $5.3 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of a facility in the second quarter of 2007. However, softness experienced in the automotive service industry and the aerospace service business partially offset these gains. 29 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Engineered Products $ 1,139,478 $ 998,676 14 % Product Identification 912,580 568,303 61 % $ 2,052,058 $ 1,566,979 31 % Segment earnings $ 291,727 $ 234,107 25 % Operating margin 14.2 % 14.9 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 29,262 $ 13,193 122 % Bookings Engineered Products $ 1,116,638 $ 1,060,404 5 % Product Identification 919,216 562,096 64 % $ 2,035,854 $ 1,622,500 25 % Backlog Engineered Products $ 227,523 $ 249,571 (9 )% Product Identification 68,938 57,706 19 % $ 296,461 $ 307,277 (4 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Engineered Systems revenue and earnings increases over the prior year reflect the December 2006 acquisition of Markem and the May 2006 acquisition of O Neil. Revenue growth due to acquisitions was 20%. However, most core businesses also improved as the segment achieved organic revenue growth of 8%, with the remainder due to the impact of foreign exchange. Engineered Products revenue and earnings increased 14% and 16%, respectively, over the prior year due to strong supermarket and heat exchanger markets. Sequentially, revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 were down 9% and 18%, respectively, reflecting normal seasonality and a slowdown in retail food equipment demand, along with reduced orders tied to high customer inventory levels in the heat exchanger business. The Product Identification platform had revenue and earnings increases of 61% and 41%, respectively, during 2007 mostly reflecting the 2006 acquisitions of Markem and O Neil. Overall, the revenue growth due to the 2006 acquisitions was 55%, while organic growth was 3% due to growth in the core direct coding business with the remainder due to foreign exchange. 30 Table of Contents Fluid Management Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Energy $ 775,024 $ 684,178 13 % Fluid Solutions 707,113 645,399 10 % Eliminations (129 ) 26 $ 1,482,008 $ 1,329,603 11 % Segment earnings $ 304,576 $ 267,377 14 % Operating margin 20.6 % 20.1 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 15,569 $ 16,183 (4 )% Bookings Energy $ 785,065 $ 693,927 13 % Fluid Solutions 716,644 653,932 10 % Eliminations (110 ) (83 ) $ 1,501,599 $ 1,347,776 11 % Backlog Energy $ 88,245 $ 75,449 17 % Fluid Solutions 73,713 63,565 16 % Eliminations (14 ) (33 ) $ 161,944 $ 138,981 17 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Fluid Management revenue and earnings increases were the result of strength at all businesses in the segment. The segment continued to benefit from strong results from the Energy platform which serves the oil, gas and power generation markets. As a result, the segment achieved organic growth of 9%, with the remainder primarily from foreign exchange. The Energy platform revenue and earnings increased 13% and 15%, respectively, primarily due to strong oil and gas markets and increased power generation demand throughout 2007. The platform earnings growth further benefited from higher volume, productivity gains and operational improvements. Fluid Solutions revenue and earnings both increased 10% when compared to the prior year due to improvements at all core businesses in the platform. Throughout 2007, the platform experienced strong demand in the chemical and rail markets. Overall, the platform had organic revenue growth of 6%, growth from acquisitions of 2%, with the remainder due to foreign exchange. 31 Table of Contents Electronic Technologies Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,390,103 $ 1,411,564 (2 )% Segment earnings $ 180,337 $ 214,947 (16 )% Operating margin 13.0 % 15.2 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 38,296 $ 32,914 16 % Bookings 1,378,551 1,410,043 (2 )% Backlog 232,704 200,048 16 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Electronic Technologies year-over-year decreases in revenue and earnings were primarily due to softness in the semi-conductor end markets throughout 2007 compared to strong markets experienced in the prior year. The medical and military/space markets were strong throughout the year, while telecom markets remained flat. Overall, the increase in revenue due to acquisitions and foreign exchange were each 3%, while organic revenue decreased 8%. Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the Company, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where the financial information of Dover is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas: Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non-essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the Company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances. Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Due to the fact that Dover operates in many different markets, changes in economic conditions in specific markets generally should not have a material effect on reserve balances required. 32 Table of Contents Inventory for the majority of the Company subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. Dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines (including SFAS No. 142) for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Dover assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, during the interim periods. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations. The valuation of Dover pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in Dover pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for Dover future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on Dover pension expenses and related funding requirements. Dover expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Dover discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. Dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using a more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the Company future taxable income levels. Dover has significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, Dover experience, and relevant industry data. Dover reviews these factors quarterly and considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. Dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify Dover ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to ensure that Dover is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional 33 Table of Contents reserves for emerging issues. While Dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair market value less costs to sell. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of its Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and stock options that are granted to employees. The model requires management to estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of Dover stock using historical data. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Adoption of New Accounting Standards 2008 Pensions Effective December 31, 2006, Dover adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). SFAS No. 158 requires companies to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net liability or asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, Dover recorded a net reduction to stockholders equity of $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new standard requires companies to measure benefit obligations and plan assets as of a Company fiscal year end (December 31, 2008 for Dover), using one of the methods prescribed in the standard. Dover adopted the new valuation date requirements using the 15-month alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which resulted in a charge of approximately $5.8 million, net of tax, to retained earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008. Fair Value In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For financial assets and liabilities, this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2007 and does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB Staff Position No. 157-2 was issued which delayed the effective date of FASB Statement No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on Dover consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company did not elect the fair value option for any of its existing financial instruments as of December 31, 2008 and the Company has not determined whether or not it will elect this option for financial instruments it may acquire in the future. 2007 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 ( FIN 48 ) which specifies the way companies are to account for uncertainty in income tax reporting, and prescribes a methodology for 34 Table of Contents recognizing, reversing and measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. As a result of adopting the new standard, the Company recorded a $58.2 million increase to reserves as a cumulative effect decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, of which $53.4 million was included in continuing operations. Including this cumulative effect adjustment, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, net of indirect benefits and deposits, of $190.5 million at January 1, 2007, of which $35.4 million related to accrued interest and penalties. The portion of the unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 included in continuing operations totaled $147.6 million, of which $28.0 million related to accrued interest and penalties. 2006 Effective January, 1 2006, Dover adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R), Share Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), which no longer permits the use of the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25. The Company used the modified prospective method to adopt SFAS No. 123(R), which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all stock-based compensation granted on or after January 1, 2006, as well as the unvested portion of previously granted options. The Company records stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis, generally over the explicit service period of three years (except for retirement eligible employees and retirees). Awards granted to retirement eligible employees are expensed immediately and the Company shortens the vesting period for any employee who will become eligible to retire within the three-year explicit service period. Expense for these employees is be recorded over the period from the date of grant through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service. Recent Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141(R) ). SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements in Statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which Statement 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. In general, the statement 1) broadens the guidance of SFAS No. 141, extending its applicability to all events where one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, 2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition, and 4) increases required disclosures. The Company will apply the provisions of this statement prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009 and can only assess the impact of the standard once an acquisition is consummated. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS 160 ). SFAS 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest be identified in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. The Company will apply the provisions of this statement prospectively, as required, beginning on January 1, 2009 and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ( SFAS No. 161 ). SFAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: 1) How and why an entity uses derivative instruments; 2) How derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations; and 3) How derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be 35 Table of Contents used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (the GAAP hierarchy). This Statement is effective 60 days following the SEC approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 142-3 Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets ( FSP No. 142-3 ) to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset (under SFAS No. 142) and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible asset (under SFAS No. 141(R)). FSP No. 142-3 amends the factors to be considered when developing renewal or extension assumptions that are used to estimate an intangible asset useful life under SFAS No. 142. The guidance in the new staff position is to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after December 31, 2008. In addition, FSP No. 142-3 increases the disclosure requirements related to renewal or extension assumptions. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total debt, total capitalization, adjusted working capital, average annual adjusted working capital, revenues excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase the Company common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational changes, given the global nature of Dover businesses. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company revenue performance and trends between periods.
