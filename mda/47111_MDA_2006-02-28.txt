Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company concluded a strong year in 2005. Operating results were consistent with management strategies to profitably grow net sales and carefully control selling, marketing and administrative costs, resulting in balanced, consistent growth in earnings, excluding certain items affecting comparability discussed below. Gross margin was lower in 2005, primarily due to business realignment charges (further discussed in Note 4) and the full-year impact of the acquired Grupo Lorena and Mauna Loa businesses. The Company gained market share in key classes of trade, introduced new product platforms that provide future growth opportunities and offset continued increases in the cost of major raw materials, energy, employee benefits and compensation. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, the result was record sales, profits and earnings per share for the year. The Company long-term goals include increasing net sales 3% 4% per year, increasing earnings before interest and income taxes ( EBIT ) 7% 9% per year, and increasing earnings per share ( EPS ) 9% 11% per year. These goals are intended to achieve balanced, sustainable growth over time. After excluding items affecting comparability, the Company exceeded all of these goals in 2005. The Company strategy to profitably grow net sales is based upon the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items utilizing its key brands, such as Hershey , Reese and Hershey Kisses, together with focused promotion and merchandising activities of new and existing products. During 2005, sales gains included recent product introductions such as Hershey Kisses filled with peanut butter, Hershey Kissables brand chocolate candies, Hershey cookies, Reese Big Cup peanut butter cups, Ice Breakers sour mints and Hershey Take5 candy bar, along with continued growth in all major trade channels. The trends of key marketplace metrics, such as retail takeaway and market share, continue to show positive results. During 2005, the Company achieved gains in retail takeaway and market share and strengthened its position in the U.S. confectionery market. In channels of distribution including sales in the food, drug and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., U.S. consumer takeaway in 2005 increased by 3.5% resulting in a market share gain of 0.9 points. Net sales increased approximately 9.2% in 2005, compared with 2004 net sales, which were approximately 6.2% above 2003. The increase in 2005, and over the three-year period, primarily resulted from higher unit sales volume due to the introduction of new products and limited edition items, along with the impact of price increases, business acquisitions, improved exchange rates on international sales and improved trade promotion efficiency resulting in lower promotional spending as a percentage of sales. Gross margin decreased from 39.5% in 2004 to 38.7% in 2005. The margin decline resulted primarily from a less favorable product mix, primarily associated with the lower-margin Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses, and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced gross 13 margin by a total of 1.1 percentage points. Improved price realization, primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for the Company international businesses, more than offset the impact of higher raw material, labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins. The Company strategy to expand EBIT margin is based upon obtaining price realization by achieving a larger part of its sales growth in its most highly profitable products and channels, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its trade promotion programs, improving efficiencies in its supply chain and tight control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. The Company has also implemented selected price increases and product weight reductions to help offset increases in raw material and other costs. EBIT margin decreased from 19.9% in 2004 to 17.8% in 2005. The EBIT margin decline resulted primarily from a lower gross margin resulting from the lower-margin Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses and the impact of business realignment charges which reduced EBIT margin by a total of 3.1 percentage points. This decrease was partially offset by an improvement in EBIT margin of 1.0 percentage points resulting from improved price realization, improved profitability for the Company international businesses and lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, which more than offset the impact of higher raw material, labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins. Net income was $493.2 million in 2005 compared with $577.9 million in 2004. Net income per share-diluted of $1.99 for 2005, was down 11.6% from $2.25 per share for 2004. Net income and net income per share-diluted for 2005 was unfavorably impacted by the business realignment initiatives discussed below. Net income for 2004 was favorably impacted by a $61.1 million adjustment to Federal and state income tax contingency reserves, as discussed below. Net income was $577.9 million in 2004 compared with $441.9 million in 2003. Net income per share-diluted of $2.25 for 2004, was up 34.7% from $1.67 per share for 2003. This gain resulted from increased income from operations, the non-recurring adjustment to the 2004 provision for income taxes, the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year and the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting changes recorded in 2003 associated with a change in accounting for the Company leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123R ). SFAS No. 123R addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its valuable equity instruments for employee services. It also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services. For public entities, the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments, including employee stock options, would be measured based on the grant-date fair value of those instruments. That cost would be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (often the vesting period). Generally, no compensation cost would be recognized for equity instruments that do not vest. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R in the fourth quarter of 2005 and applied the modified retrospective application method to all prior years for which Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 was effective. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods were adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted, modified or settled in cash subsequent to December 31, 1994. Additional stock-based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R reduced net income by $21.7 million, $13.0 million and $15.6 million, or $.09, $.05 and $.06 per share-diluted, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The additional expense for 2005 included $2.4 million after tax, or $.01 per share-diluted, in business realignment charges. The table below presents various items affecting the comparability of income over the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. All income and income per share amounts reflect the impact of the 14 adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Items affecting comparability include the impact of business realignment initiatives in 2005 and 2003, a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves, and a gain on the sale of business in 2003. The Company believes the presentation of income excluding such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations which are indicative of its ongoing operations. The Company excludes such items in evaluating key measures of performance internally and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on its business. The Company believes that this presentation provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of the business. Financial results including the impact of the reduction to the provision for income taxes, business realignment initiatives and the gain on the sale of business, over the three-year period may be insufficient in facilitating a complete understanding of the business as a whole and ascertaining the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. The business realignment initiatives are described below and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reduction to the provision for income taxes as a result of adjustments to income tax contingency reserves is described below and in Note 12. For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 In thousands of dollars except per share amounts Per share- diluted Per share- diluted Per share- diluted Income before cumulative effect of accounting change $ 493,244 $ 1.99 $ 577,901 $ 2.25 $ 449,315 $ 1.70 Items affecting comparability after tax: Business realignment and asset impairments included in cost of sales 13,397 .05 1,287 Business realignment and asset impairments, net 60,624 .24 14,201 .05 Gain on sale of business (5,706 ) (.02 ) Tax provision adjustment (61,081 ) (.24 ) Income excluding items affecting comparability $ 567,265 $ 2.28 $ 516,820 $ 2.01 $ 459,097 $ 1.73 Income per share-diluted excluding items affecting comparability increased 13.4% in 2005 and 16.2% in 2004, reflecting the impact of the Company increased sales, control of selling, marketing and administrative costs and share repurchases during the periods. This performance also drove increases in operating return on average invested capital during the period, as discussed under the heading Return Measures on page 36. During 2006, the Company expects sales growth to be somewhat above its long-term 3% 4% goal. The Company anticipates higher input costs in 2006, particularly for commodities, transportation and employee benefits. The Company expects to offset these cost increases through improved price realization, procurement strategies, continued improvements in supply chain efficiency and tight control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. EBIT is expected to increase slightly above the long-term goal of 7% 9% in 2006, excluding items affecting comparability, and EBIT margin is expected to increase approximately 90 basis points. The Company expects to achieve 2006 growth in earnings per share-diluted slightly greater than its long-term goal of 9% 11%, excluding items affecting comparability. This growth will result from the sales and EBIT margin increases discussed above, combined with the realized annual savings from business realignment initiatives, continued control of selling, marketing, and administrative costs and the impact of lower shares outstanding resulting from continued share repurchases. The Company cash flow from operations is expected to increase in 2006 primarily as a result of reduced contributions to the Company pension plans and lower working capital requirements. 15 Primary challenges in 2006 and beyond include profitable sales growth within the U.S. core confectionery category, the broader U.S. snack market and in selected international markets. Focus will continue to be placed on higher margin and faster growth channels, as well as on key global customers in selected regions of the world. The achievement of the Company objectives for sales growth and profitability will also be challenged by changes in the business and competitive environment which will continue to be characterized by increased global competition and customer consolidation, along with social issues such as obesity concerns. In 2006, the Company will continue to be faced with achieving increased price realization and improved productivity in order to offset higher input costs for ingredients, transportation and employee benefits. Successfully meeting these challenges is critical to the Company achievement of its financial objectives. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales Net sales for 2005 increased $406.7 million, or 9.2%, from 2004. Business acquisitions contributed approximately 2.9% of the increase from 2004. Approximately two-thirds of the additional sales increase of 6.3% resulted from unit volume growth, primarily reflecting the introduction of new products and limited edition items, and improved performance by the Company international businesses, particularly the Canadian, Mexican and export businesses in Asia and Latin America. The remainder of the sales increase resulted from selling price increases, a lower rate of promotional spending and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates for the Company international businesses. Net sales increased $256.7 million, or 6.2%, from 2003 to 2004. Net sales were favorably impacted by increased sales volume, especially within the United States, primarily driven by the introduction of innovative new products and limited edition items. Net sales of the Company Canadian, Mexican and Brazilian businesses also improved as a result of higher sales volume. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates also resulted in increased sales for the Company international businesses, particularly in Canada. The positive impact of increased sales volume contributed more than 75% of the consolidated net sales growth. Higher selling prices, a more efficient rate of promotional spending and the acquisition of the Grupo Lorena business in Mexico also contributed to the net sales increase. Sales were unfavorably affected by the divestiture of certain gum brands in September 2003, decreased sales of remaining gum brands, and higher returns, discounts and allowances, relating primarily to the sales volume growth, along with lower export sales in Asia, particularly in China and Taiwan. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased $285.1 million, or 10.6%, from 2004 to 2005. Business realignment charges increased cost of sales by $22.5 million. The remainder of the cost increase was primarily caused by higher sales volume, business acquisitions, and higher raw material costs, in addition to higher labor, overhead and distribution costs. Gross margin decreased from 39.5% in 2004 to 38.7% in 2005. The margin decline resulted primarily from a less favorable product mix, primarily associated with the lower-margin Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses, and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced gross margin by a total of 1.1 percentage points. Improved price realization, primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for the Company international businesses, more than offset the impact of higher raw material, labor and overhead costs and sales of certain new products which currently have lower margins. Cost of sales increased $135.7 million, or 5.3%, from 2003 to 2004. The cost increase was primarily caused by higher sales volume and higher raw material costs, principally associated with increased prices for cocoa and dairy products. These cost of sales increases were partially offset by lower costs primarily resulting from product weight reductions and reduced costs for packaging materials. Gross margin increased from 39.0% in 2003 to 39.5% in 2004. The margin expansion reflected improved price realization, primarily from reduced product weights and reduced promotional 16 spending as a percentage of sales, as well as efficiency improvements in manufacturing operations. The margin improvements were partially offset by increases in raw material costs. Selling, Marketing and Administrative Selling, marketing and administrative expenses for 2005 increased $45.9 million, or 5.3%, from 2004, primarily reflecting increased performance-based employee compensation costs (which include stock-based compensation), incremental expenses related to business acquisitions and higher consumer promotion expenses. These increases were offset somewhat by lower advertising expense. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined from 19.6% in 2004 to 18.9% in 2005. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses for 2004 increased by $26.0 million, or 3.1%, from 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation costs (which have been adjusted to reflect stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123R), increased consumer promotion expenses, termination costs associated with the closing of certain warehouse facilities, and litigation expenses associated with the introduction of Hershey SmartZone nutrition bars. These increases were offset somewhat by lower advertising expenses and a reduction in allowances for doubtful accounts, as described below. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, decreased from 20.2% in 2003 to 19.6% in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company reached an agreement with Fleming Reclamation Creditor Trust, which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy of Fleming Companies, Inc., one of the Company customers. Based on this agreement, the Company reduced its bad debt reserves by the $5.0 million which had been added at the time of the bankruptcy announcement in April 2003. Business Realignment Initiatives In July 2005, the Company announced initiatives intended to advance its value-enhancing strategy. The Company also announced that it would record a total pre-tax charge of approximately $140 million to $150 million, or $.41 to $.44 per share-diluted in connection with these initiatives. Of the total pre-tax charge, approximately $80 million will be incurred in connection with a U.S. Voluntary Workforce Reduction Program ( VWRP ), approximately $41 million will be incurred in connection with facility rationalization, and approximately $24 million will be incurred in connection with streamlining and restructuring the Company international operations, including a Canadian VWRP. During the second half of 2005, the Company recorded charges totaling $119.0 million associated with the initiatives. The charges of $119.0 million consisted of a $96.5 million business realignment charge and $22.5 million recorded in cost of sales (together, the 2005 business realignment initiatives ). The business realignment charge included $69.5 million related to the U.S. VWRP, $12.8 million for facility rationalization relating to the closure of the Las Piedras, Puerto Rico plant, and $14.2 million related to streamlining the Company international operations, primarily associated with costs for the Canadian VWRP. The charge for facility rationalization included $8.3 million for involuntary termination benefits primarily for Las Piedras plant employees. The $22.5 million recorded in cost of sales resulted primarily from accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Las Piedras manufacturing facility. The Company believes that the 2005 business realignment initiatives will be fully completed by December 31, 2006. Based on current estimates, the cost to implement the business realignment program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $140 million to $150 million, or $.35 to $.38 per share-diluted on an after-tax basis. Total pre-tax charges of $119.0 million, or $.29 per share-diluted, were recorded in the second half of 2005, with the remainder to be substantially recorded in the first half of 2006. 17 Changes in liabilities recorded for the business realignment initiatives were as follows: Accrued Liabilities Balance 10/02/05 Fourth Quarter Utilization New charges during Fourth Quarter Balance 12/31/05 In thousands of dollars VWRP $ 33,726 $ (5,650 ) $3,807 $31,883 Facility rationalization 4,725 (6,615 ) 1,890 Streamline international operations 5,390 (890 ) 1,388 5,888 Total $ 43,841 $ (13,155 ) $7,085 $ 37,771 During 2003, the Company executed a number of initiatives continuing its value-enhancing strategy. These initiatives included realigning the sales organization and streamlining the supply chain by divesting or eliminating certain non-strategic brands and products, and by production line rationalization. These actions resulted in a net charge of approximately $17.2 million, or $.04 per share-diluted. The $17.2 million net charge consisted of the write-off of certain inventories of $2.1 million included in cost of sales, a net business realignment and asset impairments charge of $23.4 million and an $8.3 million net gain resulting from the divestiture of certain brands (together, the 2003 business realignment initiatives ). The net business realignment and asset impairments charge of $23.4 million consisted of early retirement and involuntary termination costs of $10.0 million, sales office closing and relocation costs of $7.3 million, fixed asset impairment charges of $5.7 million, equipment removal costs of $.7 million and a net gain of $.3 million relating to the elimination of non-strategic brands and products. In determining the fixed asset impairment losses, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Cash payments during 2004 reduced the liability balance to $3.9 million as of December 31, 2004. Cash payments during 2005 reduced the liability balance to $1.3 million. Arising out of the 2003 business realignment initiatives, eight former employees of the Company filed a complaint in federal court in Colorado alleging the Company discriminated against them on the basis of age. The trial of these claims is scheduled to begin in the Fall of 2006. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims and, based on the developments of the case to date, the Company does not consider the likelihood of a material unfavorable outcome to the Company to be probable. Gain on Sale of Business As part of the Company business realignment initiatives, the sale of a group of gum brands to Farley & Sathers Candy Company, Inc. ( Farley & Sathers ) was completed in September 2003. The gum brands included Fruit Stripe chewing gum, Rain-Blo gum balls and Super Bubble bubble gum. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company received cash proceeds from the sale of $20.0 million and recorded a gain of $8.3 million before tax, or $5.7 million after tax, as a result of the transaction. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense in 2005 was $21.5 million higher than 2004, primarily reflecting higher short-term interest expense and decreased capitalized interest. The increase in short-term interest expense was primarily associated with commercial paper borrowings to finance stock repurchases and contributions to the Company pension plans, in addition to higher interest rates in 2005. Net interest expense for 2004 was $3.0 million higher than in 2003 primarily reflecting higher short-term interest expense, partially offset by increased capitalized interest. The increase in short-term interest expense was associated with commercial paper borrowings during 2004 for repurchases of Common Stock, business acquisitions and other funding requirements. 18 Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2005 was 36.2%, compared with 29.1% in 2004 and 36.6% in 2003. The effective income tax rate for 2005 benefited by 0.2 percentage points from the impact of tax rates associated with the business realignment charges. The effective income tax rate for 2004 is not comparable with the rates for 2005 and 2003 because the Company provision for income taxes was reduced by the $61.1 million adjustment to income tax contingency reserves recorded in the second quarter of 2004. This non-cash reduction of income tax expense resulted from the settlement of Federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years, as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues. Based upon the results of the audits, the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted, resulting in a reduction of $61.1 million in income tax expense. The income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses, interest on potential assessments, and acquisition and divestiture matters. The reduction in the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves reduced the effective income tax rate by 7.3 percentage points. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change An after-tax charge of $7.4 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, was recorded in 2003 to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the Company leases of certain warehouse and distribution facilities as discussed further under the heading Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments. Net Income Net income decreased $84.7 million, or 14.6%, and net income per share-diluted decreased $.26, from 2004 to 2005. Net income for 2005 was unfavorably impacted by total charges associated with business realignment initiatives of $119.0 million before tax, $74.0 million after tax or $.29 per share-diluted. Net income for 2004 was favorably impacted by $61.1 million, or $.24 per share-diluted, as a result of the adjustment to the Federal and state income tax contingency reserves. Net income was $577.9 million in 2004 compared with $441.9 million in 2003. Net income per share-diluted of $2.25 for 2004, increased $.58 per share from $1.67 per share for 2003 as a result of the reduction to the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves, increased income from operations and the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases during the year, in addition to the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting change recorded in 2003. FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company financial condition remained strong during 2005. The capitalization ratio (total short-term and long-term debt as a percent of stockholders equity, short-term and long-term debt) increased to 63% as of December 31, 2005, from 54% as of December 31, 2004. The higher capitalization ratio in 2005 primarily reflected the impact of additional short-term and long-term borrowings. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.9:1 as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004. In August 2005, the Company acquired the assets of Joseph Schmidt Confections, Inc., a premium chocolate maker located in San Francisco, California. Joseph Schmidt is known for its artistic and innovative truffles, colorful chocolate mosaics, specialty cookies, and handcrafted chocolates. These products are sold in select department stores and other specialty outlets nationwide as well as in Joseph Schmidt stores located in San Jose and San Francisco, California. Also, in August 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, Inc. Based in San Francisco, California, Scharffen Berger is known for its high-cacao content, signature dark chocolate bars and baking products sold online and in a broad range of outlets, including specialty retailers, natural food stores and gourmet centers across the country. Scharffen Berger also owns and operates three specialty stores located in New York City, Berkeley, and San 19 Francisco. The combined purchase price for Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt was $47.1 million, with the final amount subject to upward adjustment not to exceed $61.1 million to be determined based upon actual sales growth through 2007. Together, these companies have combined annual sales of approximately $25 million. In December 2004, the Company acquired Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation ( Mauna Loa ) for $127.8 million. Mauna Loa is the leading processor and marketer of macadamia snacks, with annual sales of approximately $80 million. In October 2004, the Company Mexican subsidiary, Hershey Mexico, acquired Grupo Lorena, one of Mexico top sugar confectionery companies, for $39.0 million. This business has annual sales of over $30 million. Included in the acquisition was the Pel n Pelo Rico brand. Results subsequent to the dates of acquisition were included in the consolidated financial statements. Had the results of the acquisitions been included in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented, the effect would not have been material. In July 2004, the Company purchased 11,281,589 shares of its Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust, in a privately negotiated transaction. The Company paid $44.32 per share, or approximately $500.0 million for the shares and fees of $1.4 million associated with the transaction. In October 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Mr. Freeze freeze pops business in Canada for $2.7 million. In September 2003, the Company completed the sale of certain gum brands to Farley & Sathers for $20.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment initiatives. The gum brands included Fruit Stripe chewing gum, Rain-Blo gum balls and Super Bubble bubble gum. Assets Total assets increased $482.5 million, or 12.7% as of December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of higher accounts receivable, inventories and other assets. Current assets increased by $211.2 million, principally reflecting increased accounts receivable resulting from increased sales of new products and seasonal items in December 2005, which qualified for extended payment terms, and higher inventories associated with the timing of receipts of raw materials, along with increased goods in process inventories to support higher manufacturing requirements in early 2006. Property, plant and equipment was lower than the prior year primarily due to depreciation expense of $200.1 million, including $21.8 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to the 2005 business realignment initiatives as discussed above, partially offset by capital additions of $181.1 million. Goodwill increased as a result of the 2005 business acquisitions. The increase in other intangibles primarily reflected the estimated value of trademarks and customer-related intangibles from the business acquisitions. The increase in other assets was primarily related to contributions to the Company pension plans of $277.5 million, reduced somewhat as a result of pension expense recorded in 2005. Liabilities Total liabilities increased by $598.5 million as of December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting an increase in short-term and long-term borrowings and higher deferred income taxes. Higher accrued liabilities were primarily associated with the business realignment initiatives, offset somewhat by reduced liabilities for promotional allowances. The increase in short-term debt of $475.8 million reflected commercial paper borrowings primarily associated with the repurchase of the Company Common Stock, pension contributions, and the acquisition of the Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt businesses, along with other funding requirements. The decrease in the current portion of long-term debt was associated with the retirement of $201.2 million of 6.7% Notes in October 2005 and the refinancing of $76.8 million related to certain lease agreements. The increase in other long-term liabilities was primarily associated with post-retirement and pension benefits in addition to deferred 20 incentive compensation. The increase in deferred taxes was primarily associated with the impact of pension contributions made during 2005. Capital Structure The Company has two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors, with the Common Stock having one vote per share and the Class B Stock having ten votes per share. However, the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is entitled to elect one-sixth of the Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, the Common Stock is entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. The Milton Hershey School Trust maintains voting control over the Company. However, the Milton Hershey School Trust has not taken an active role in setting policy for the Company, nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of the Company Board of Directors or management. The Milton Hershey School Trust decided to explore a sale of the Company in June 2002, but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in September 2002. After terminating the sale process, the Trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust advised the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General in September 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the Company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust following advance notice to the Office of Attorney General. Subsequently, Pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer having voting control of the Company. The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede, and petition the Court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. This legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the Company outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. In December 2000, the Company Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ( Rights Agreement ). The Company largest stockholder, the Milton Hershey School Trust, supported the Rights Agreement. This action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the Company. Under the Rights Agreement, the Company Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right ( Right ) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which the Company Common Stock is traded. The Rights Agreement is discussed further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company major source of financing has been cash generated from operations. The Company income and, consequently, cash provided from operations during the year are affected by seasonal sales patterns, the timing of new product introductions, business acquisitions and divestitures, and price changes. Sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year, representing seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, seasonal working capital needs peak during the summer months and have been met by issuing commercial paper. Over the past three years, cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.8 billion, which includes contributions to the Company pension plans of $405.8 million. Cash provided from operating activities was more than sufficient to fund investing activities, which included capital additions, capitalized software additions and business acquisitions. Cash used by investing activities totaled 21 $818.4 million. Over the three year period, cash used by financing activities totaled $1.2 billion. Financing activities included cash used for the repurchase of common stock of $1.7 billion and cash dividends of $611.7 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash provided from net short-term and long-term borrowings of $761.5 million and cash provided from the exercise of stock options of $216.4 million. Cash equivalents decreased by $230.6 million over the three-year period. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures and capitalized software additions will be in the range of $190 million to $200 million per year during the next several years primarily for continued efficiency improvements in existing facilities and capacity expansion to support sales growth and new products, along with continued improvement and enhancements of computer software. As of December 31, 2005, the Company principal capital commitments included manufacturing capacity expansion to support sales growth and new products, modernization and efficiency improvements and selected enhancements of computer software. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the Company pension plan assets exceeded benefits obligations by $157.0 million. Contributions totaling $277.5 million, $8.0 million and $120.3 million were made to the pension plans during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily to improve the funded status. Under share repurchase programs which began in 1993, a total of 55,836,092 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased for approximately $1.5 billion, including purchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust of 8,000,000 shares for $103.1 million in 1993 and 3,159,558 shares for $100.0 million in 1999. Of the shares repurchased, 1,056,000 shares were retired and 24,309,875 shares were reissued to satisfy stock option obligations, Supplemental Retirement Contributions and employee stock ownership trust ( ESOP ) obligations. Of the shares reissued, 21,624,812 shares were repurchased in the open market to replace the reissued shares. Additionally, the Company has purchased a total of 67,282,661 shares of its Common Stock to be held as Treasury Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust for $1.5 billion in privately negotiated transactions, including 11,281,589 shares for approximately $500 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 119,377,690 shares were held as Treasury Stock. In April 2005, the Company Board of Directors approved a $250 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2005, $62.9 million remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under this program. In December 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million stock repurchase authorization. The Company expects to complete both authorizations by the end of 2006. In this regard, the Company and Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the Milton Hershey School Trust ), have entered into an agreement under which the Milton Hershey School Trust intends to participate on a proportional basis in the Company stock repurchase program. The price at which the Milton Hershey School Trust will sell stock to the Company is based on a formula under which the Milton Hershey School Trust will not be required to sell shares to the Company for an amount less than $55 per share. The agreement will expire on July 31, 2006. The Company exercised its option to purchase two warehouse and distribution facilities subject to consolidated lease arrangements and refinanced the related obligations of $59.3 million and $17.5 million in July and October 2005, respectively. In August 2005, the Company issued $250 million of 4.85% Notes due in 2015 under the Form S-3 Registration Statement which was declared effective in August 1997. The Company filed another Form S-3 Registration Statement that was declared effective in January 2006 (the January 2006 Registration Statement ) under which it could offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $750 million of additional debt securities. Proceeds from the debt issuance and any offering of the debt securities available under the January 2006 Registration Statement may be used for general corporate purposes which include reducing existing commercial paper borrowings, financing capital 22 additions, and funding contributions to the Company pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. The Company expects to execute $500 million of term financing during 2006 under the January 2006 Registration Statement. In November 2004, the Company entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with the banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders listed on the respective signature pages thereof ( Lenders ), Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders (as defined therein), Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, UBS Loan Finance LLC, as documentation agent, and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers. The Credit Agreement establishes an unsecured revolving credit facility under which the Company may borrow up to $900 million with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $600 million with the concurrence of the Lenders. Funds borrowed may be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. Advances other than competitive bid advances may be repaid without penalty at any time prior to the last day of the Credit Agreement. Competitive bid advances must be paid at maturity, and may not be prepaid. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant whereby the ratio of (a) pre-tax income from operations from the most recent four fiscal quarters to (b) consolidated interest expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters may not be less than 2.0 to 1 at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default. Payment of outstanding advances may be accelerated, at the option of the Lenders, should the Company default in its obligations under the Credit Agreement. In September 2005, the Company entered into a new short-term credit agreement to establish an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $300 million. The agreement expired on December 30, 2005. Funds were used for general corporate purposes. The new short-term credit facility was entered into because the Company expected borrowings to exceed $900 million for up to three months beginning in early October 2005 due to the retirement of $200 million of 10-year notes in October 2005, refinancing of certain consolidated lease arrangements, recent contributions to the Company pension plans, stock repurchases and seasonal working capital needs. The Company also maintains lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks, under which it could borrow in various currencies up to approximately $71.1 million and $60.3 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The higher lines of credit as of December 31, 2005, were primarily associated with the Company businesses in Mexico and Brazil. Cash Flow Activities Over the past three years, cash from operating activities provided approximately $1.8 billion. Over this period, cash used by or provided from accounts receivable and inventories has tended to fluctuate as a result of sales during December and inventory management practices. The change in cash provided from other assets and liabilities between the years was primarily related to hedging transactions and the timing of payments for accrued liabilities, including income taxes. In 2004, the adjustment of deferred income taxes primarily reflected the deferred tax benefit resulting from the $61.1 million adjustment to income tax contingency reserves recorded in the second quarter of 2004 and an increase resulting from the Mauna Loa acquisition. Investing activities included capital additions, capitalized software additions, and several business acquisitions and divestitures. Capital additions during the past three years included the purchase of manufacturing equipment, and expansion and modernization of existing facilities. Capitalized software additions over the past three years were associated primarily with the ongoing enhancement of information systems. In August 2005, the Company acquired the assets of Joseph Schmidt Confections, Inc. and completed the acquisition of Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, Inc. The combined purchase price for Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt was $47.1 million, with the final amount subject to upward adjustment not to exceed $61.1 million to be determined based upon actual sales growth through 2007. 23 In December 2004, the Company acquired Mauna Loa, a leading processor and marketer of macadamia snacks, for $127.8 million and in October 2004, the Company Mexican subsidiary, Hershey Mexico, acquired Grupo Lorena, one of Mexico top sugar confectionery companies, for $39.0 million. In July 2004, the Company purchased 11,281,589 shares of its Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust in a privately negotiated transaction. The Company paid $44.32 per share, or approximately $500.0 million, for the shares and fees of $1.4 million associated with the transaction. In October 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Mr. Freeze freeze pops business in Canada for $2.7 million. In September 2003, the Company completed the sale of a group of gum brands to Farley & Sathers for $20.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment initiatives. Financing activities included debt borrowings and repayments, payments of dividends, the exercise of stock options, incentive plan transactions and the repurchase of Common Stock. During the past three years, short-term borrowings in the form of commercial paper or bank borrowings were used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and finance share repurchase programs, including the purchase of Common Stock from the Milton Hershey School Trust. During the past three years, a total of 30,954,443 shares of Common Stock have been repurchased for $1.7 billion of which 22,991,517 shares were purchased for $1.2 billion under share repurchase programs and 7,962,926 shares were purchased for $.5 billion in the open market to replace Treasury Stock issued primarily for stock options exercises. The Company intends to repurchase shares to replace shares issued for stock options exercises. The value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based upon stock options exercises over time and market conditions. Cash payments for share repurchases were partially offset by cash receipts of $216.4 million from stock options exercises. Net cash provided from operating activities was $461.8 million for 2005, a decrease of $326.0 million compared with 2004. The primary contributors to the decrease were an increase in contributions to the Company pension plans of $269.5 million from 2004 to 2005 and an increase in cash used by accounts receivable reflecting higher sales of new products and seasonal items in December 2005, which qualified for extended payment terms. The increase in cash provided from deferred income taxes principally reflected the tax impact of higher pension plan contributions in 2005 versus 2004. Cash provided from changes in other assets and liabilities was $32.0 million in 2005 compared with cash provided of $108.4 million in 2004. The change in cash flows primarily reflected an increase in cash used as a result of changes in accrued liabilities for selling and marketing programs and long-term liabilities for incentive compensation in 2005 compared with 2004. Net cash provided from operating activities was $787.8 million for 2004, an increase of $203.3 million compared with the prior year. The primary contributors to the increase were higher net income and increases in cash provided from other assets and liabilities and accounts receivable. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash flows related to deferred income taxes, principally reflecting the deferred tax benefit resulting from the income tax contingency reserve adjustment of $73.7 million in the second quarter of 2004, and cash used as a result of higher inventories as of December 31, 2004, to support higher sales anticipated in early 2005 prior to the effective date of selling price increases. Cash provided from changes in other assets and liabilities was $108.4 million in 2004 compared with cash provided of $31.2 million in 2003. The change in cash flows reflected increased cash provided from commodity transactions, primarily reflecting higher commodity futures market prices in 2004, and cash provided from higher liabilities primarily associated with incentive plans in 2004. An increase in cash provided by accounts receivable in 2004 compared with cash used by accounts receivable in 2003 was primarily attributable to improved cash collections. 24 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments The following table summarizes the Company contractual cash obligations by year: Payments Due by Year (In thousands of dollars) Contractual Obligations 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Unconditional Purchase Obligations $ 977,500 $ 343,800 $ 101,200 $ 54,800 $ $ $ 1,477,300 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 13,119 11,819 10,433 7,078 5,461 10,938 58,848 Long-term Debt 56 190,000 147 136 142 752,330 942,811 Total Obligations $ 990,675 $ 545,619 $ 111,780 $ 62,014 $ 5,603 $ 763,268 $ 2,478,959 In entering into contractual obligations, the Company has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. The Company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults. The Company has entered into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. Purchase obligations primarily reflect forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations. Total obligations for each year are comprised of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that have been valued using market prices as of December 31, 2005. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. However, the variability of such costs is mitigated to the extent of the Company futures price cover for those periods. Accordingly, increases or decreases in market prices will be offset by gains or losses on commodity futures contracts to the extent that the unpriced contracts are hedged as of December 31, 2005 and in future periods. Taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, such obligations were fully satisfied by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ( Interpretation No. 46 ). Interpretation No. 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of special-purpose entities ( SPEs ), such as special-purpose trusts ( SPTs ), to which the usual condition for consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, does not apply because the SPEs have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests. The Company adopted Interpretation No. 46 as of June 30, 2003, resulting in the consolidation of three off-balance sheet arrangements with SPTs. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004 the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. The consolidation of the SPTs resulted in an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of the accounting change of approximately $7.4 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, in the third quarter of 2003, reflecting the after-tax effect of accumulated depreciation for these facilities from lease inception through June 29, 2003. Additionally, the consolidation of these entities resulted in a net increase to property, plant and equipment of approximately $107.7 million, with a corresponding increase to long-term debt of $115.5 million and to other long-term liabilities of $4.4 million, reflecting the third party equity interest associated with the lease arrangements. Prior to June 30, 2003, expenses associated with the lease arrangements were classified as rent expense and included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent to the 25 consolidation of these entities, expenses were classified as interest expense associated with the corresponding long-term debt. The consolidation of these entities resulted in an increase to interest expense of $2.8 million in 2003, offset by a decrease in rental expense for these facilities included in cost of sales. During 1999 and 2000, the Company entered into off-balance sheet arrangements for the leasing of certain warehouse and distribution facilities in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Atlanta, Georgia and Redlands, California. These off-balance sheet arrangements enabled the Company to lease these facilities under more favorable terms than other leasing alternatives. The lease arrangements were with SPTs. The SPTs were formed to facilitate the acquisition and subsequent leasing of the facilities to the Company. The SPTs financed the acquisition of the facilities by issuing notes and equity certificates to independent third-party financial institutions. The independent third-party financial institutions that hold the equity certificates are the owners of the SPTs. The owners of the SPTs made substantive residual equity capital investments in excess of 3% which were at risk during the entire term of each lease. Accordingly, the Company did not consolidate the SPTs prior to June 30, 2003 because all of the conditions for consolidation had not been met. As of December 31, 2005, only the lease for the Redlands, California warehouse and distribution facility remained in effect. The properties in Pennsylvania and Georgia were purchased and the leases terminated in July and October 2005, respectively. The following is a summary of each of the lease transactions: In December 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility in Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement contained an option for the Company to purchase the facility. In January 2002, the Company assigned its right to purchase the facility to an SPT that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to the Company under a new lease agreement. The lease term is five years, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1 million. In October 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement with an SPT for the leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility near Atlanta, Georgia. The lease term was five years, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $18.2 million. In October 2005, at the end of the initial lease term, the Company exercised its option to purchase the facility and refinanced the related obligation of $17.5 million. In July 1999, the Company entered into a lease agreement with an SPT for the construction and leasing of a warehouse and distribution facility located on land owned by the Company near Hershey, Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, the lessor paid construction costs totaling $61.7 million. The lease term was six years, including the one-year construction period, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. In July 2005, at the end of the initial lease term, the Company exercised its option to purchase the facility and refinanced the related obligation of $59.3 million. Aside from the residual guarantee and instrument guarantee associated with the individual leasing arrangement for the Redlands, California facility, as discussed below, the Company has provided no other guarantees or capitalization of the SPT associated with the Redlands facility. The Company has not collateralized the obligation in connection with the lease. The Company has no obligations with respect to refinancing of the lessor debt, would incur no significant penalties which would result in the reasonable assurance of continuation of the lease and has no significant guarantees other than the residual and instrument guarantees discussed below. There are no other material commitments or contingent liabilities associated with the leasing arrangement. The Company transactions with the SPT are limited to the lease agreement. The Company does not anticipate entering into any other arrangements involving SPEs. 26 The lease includes a substantial residual guarantee by the Company for a significant amount of the financing and an option to purchase the facility at original cost. Pursuant to instrument guarantees, in the event of a default under the lease agreement, the Company guaranteed to the note holders and certificate holders payment in an amount equal to all sums then due under the lease. There are no penalties or other disincentives under the lease agreement if the Company decides not to renew the lease. The terms for each renewal period under the lease arrangement are identical to the initial terms and do not represent bargain lease terms. If the Company were to exercise its option to purchase the facility at original cost at the end of the initial lease term, the Company could purchase the facility for a total of approximately $40.1 million in 2007. If the Company chooses not to renew the lease or purchase the assets at the end of the lease term, the Company is obligated under the residual guarantee for approximately $35.7 million for the lease. Additionally, the Company is obligated to re-market the property on the lessor behalf and, upon sale, distribute a portion of the proceeds to the note holders and certificate holders up to an amount equal to the remaining debt and equity certificates and to pay closing costs. If the Company chooses not to renew or purchase the assets at the end of the lease term, the Company does not anticipate a material disruption to operations, since such a facility is not unique, facilities with similar racking and storage capabilities are available in the area where the facility is located, there are no significant leasehold improvements that would be impaired, there would be no adverse tax consequences, the financing of a replacement facility would not be material to the Company cash flows and costs related to relocation would not be significant to income. The Company has a number of facilities which contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations. Current regulations do not require the Company to remove or remediate locations containing asbestos in existing facilities. However, current regulations do require that the Company handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. The Company does not have plans to renovate or demolish these facilities in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Company believes it does not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities because the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates cannot be specified and information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. The facilities are expected to be maintained by repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos. The Company provision for income taxes, accrued income taxes and deferred income taxes are based upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of the Company and interpretation of tax laws. As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by Federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. The Company maintains reserves for such assessments. The reserves are determined based upon the Company judgment of assessment risk and are adjusted, from time to time, based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. A settlement of Federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years, as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the results of the audits, the income tax contingency reserves were adjusted resulting in a reduction of income tax reserves by $73.7 million, reflecting a reduction of the provision for income taxes by $61.1 million and a reduction to goodwill of $12.6 million. The income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses, interest on potential assessments, and acquisition and divestiture matters. Assessments of additional tax require use of the Company cash. The Company is not aware of any significant income tax assessments. 27 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company utilizes certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures contracts, to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures. Interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts and options are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. Commodities futures contracts are entered into for varying periods and are intended to be and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, the Company has assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company does not expect any significant losses as a result of counterparty defaults. The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended ( SFAS No. 133, as amended ). SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. For a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as a fair value hedge), the gain or loss must be recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. All derivative instruments currently utilized by the Company, including variable to fixed interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and options and commodities futures contracts, are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The information below summarizes the Company market risks associated with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2005. This information should be read in conjunction with Note 1, Note 6 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Term Debt The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2005. The fair value of long-term debt was determined based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. Maturity Date (In thousands of dollars except for rates) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fair Value Long-term Debt $ 56 $ 190,000 $ 147 $ 136 $ 142 $ 752,330 $ 942,811 $ 1,051,127 Interest Rate 2.0 % 6.3 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 6.6 % 6.5 % Interest rates on variable rate obligations were calculated using the rates in effect as of December 31, 2005. 28 Interest Rate Swaps In order to minimize its financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. In December 2005, the Company entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated $500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006. The weighted average fixed rate on the forward swap agreements is 5.1%. In October 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert interest payments on long-term debt from fixed to variable rates. Interest payments on $200.0 million of 6.7% Notes due in October 2005 and $150.0 million of 6.95% Notes due in March 2007 were converted from the respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR. In March 2004, the Company terminated these agreements, resulting in cash receipts totaling $5.2 million, with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the long-term debt. This increase is being amortized over the remaining term of the respective long-term debt as a reduction to interest expense. In February 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted variable-interest-rate payments on certain leases from a variable to a fixed rate of 6.1%. These interest rate swap agreements expired at the end of the respective lease terms during 2005. The fair value of interest rate swaps is defined as the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period. The fair value of the swap agreements is calculated quarterly based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments. The fair value of the forward swap agreements was a liability of $4.9 million as of December 31, 2005. The fair value of the variable to fixed interest rate swaps was a liability of $1.7 million as of December 31, 2004. The potential net loss in fair value of interest rate swaps of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates was $.5 million and $.2 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company risk related to the interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the agreements at prevailing market rates. Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts and Options The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions primarily related to firm commitments to purchase or forecasted purchases of equipment, certain raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with its subsidiaries outside the United States. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. Foreign currency price risks are hedged generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are intended to be and are effective as hedges of identifiable, foreign currency commitments. Foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedging derivatives and the fair value of such contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in 2006 and 2007 to purchase $51.1 million in foreign currency, primarily Australian dollars, British sterling and euros. As of December 31, 2005, the Company did not have foreign exchange forward contracts or options to sell foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts and options maturing primarily in 2005 and 2006 to purchase $103.1 million in foreign currency, primarily Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, and to sell $30.8 million in foreign currency, primarily Mexican pesos and Japanese yen, at contracted forward rates. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts and options is defined as the amount of the difference between contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of the period. On a quarterly basis, the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options is estimated 29 by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was an asset of $.4 million and $4.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates was $.1 million and $.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company risk related to the foreign exchange contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. Commodity Price Risk Management The Company most significant raw material requirements include cocoa, sugar, milk, peanuts and almonds. The Company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of these raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts. At the present time, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the Company other major raw material requirements. Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener, natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw material and energy requirements. Fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the Company transportation costs. The Company commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and to provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases. The cost of cocoa beans and the prices for the related commodity futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors, including the effect of weather on crop yield, other imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences. During 2005, cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between 64 and 79 per pound, based on the New York Board of Trade futures contract. The Company costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices, premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. Commodities Futures Contracts In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. Exchange traded futures contracts are used to fix the price of physical forward purchase contracts. Cash transfers reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts (unrealized gains and losses) are made on a daily basis. The Company accounts for commodities futures contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, and accordingly, cash transfers are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Such cash transfers will be offset by higher or lower cash requirements for payment of invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs in the future. Futures being held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases. The following sensitivity analysis reflects the market risk of the Company to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent, based on the Company net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year. The Company net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts held over or under the amount required to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities, relating to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet contracted for were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. A loss is defined, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the 30 opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The fair values of net commodity positions were based upon quoted market prices or estimated future prices including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period. For the years ended December 31, 2005 2004 In millions of dollars Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Highest long position $ 16.3 $ 1.6 $ 128.2 $ 12.8 Lowest long position (204.5 ) 20.5 (30.1 ) 3.0 Average position (long) (126.3 ) 12.6 62.7 6.3 The decrease in fair values from 2004 to 2005 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions. The negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures being held at certain points in time during the years. Sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected. The important factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield, other imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences in addition to changes in the Company hedging strategies. USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period. Significant accounting policies employed by the Company, including the use of estimates, are presented in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates involved in applying the Company accounting policies are those that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and those for which different estimates reasonably could have been used for the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, and would have a material impact on the presentation of the Company financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The Company most critical accounting estimates, discussed below, pertain to accounting policies for accounts receivable trade, accrued liabilities and pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Accounts Receivable Trade In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. The Company primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, which accounted for approximately 20.3% of the Company total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company total accounts receivable and the Company believes that it has little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of its customer base. Accounts Receivable Trade, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. The Company monitors the collectibility of its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable, assessing the credit worthiness of its 31 customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks. Estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded expense averaging approximately $1.2 million per year for potential uncollectible accounts, including a $5.0 million provision in 2003 related to the estimate of probable exposure to the bankruptcy of one of the Company customers, Fleming Companies, Inc. This provision was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2004 upon the agreement with Fleming Reclamation Creditor Trust which resolved most significant matters related to the bankruptcy. Write-offs of uncollectible accounts, net of recoveries, averaged approximately $2.9 million over the same period. The provision for uncollectible accounts is recognized as selling, marketing and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Over the past three years, the allowance for doubtful accounts has ranged from 1% to 3% of gross accounts receivable. If reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions were made with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable, the amounts by which the annual provision would have changed would have resulted in a reduction in expense of approximately $2.5 million to an increase in expense of approximately $1.5 million. Changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on the Company liquidity or capital resources. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products. The Company utilizes numerous trade promotion programs. The costs of such programs are recognized as a reduction to net sales with the recording of a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of product shipment. The accrued liability for marketing promotions is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future as a result of changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Promotional costs were $584.8 million, $557.5 million and $551.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs would have resulted in changes ranging from a reduction in such costs of approximately $16.6 million to an increase in costs of approximately $6.4 million, with an increase or decrease to net sales and income before income taxes within that range. Over the last three years, actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 6%. Changes in estimates related to the cost of promotion programs would not have a material impact on the Company liquidity or capital resources. At the time of sale, the Company estimates a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future. The estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales. A related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales patterns, and product movement at retail. Estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, changes in consumer demand, the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotion programs. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2% of gross sales. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from $.5 million to $1.0 million. In each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, actual costs have not deviated from the Company estimates by more than 1%. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on the Company liquidity or capital resources. 32 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans The Company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans. The principal plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees. The Company is monitoring legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans, as well as recent court cases, for any impact on its plans. The Company also sponsors two primary post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with participants contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. The Company policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Federal income tax laws, respectively. Non-domestic pension liabilities are funded in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. Plan assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations. These calculations are made considering payroll and employee data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements. The Company takes into consideration long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With regard to liabilities associated with other post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance, the Company takes into consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits. In compliance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, the discount rate assumption is reviewed and may be revised annually. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption ( asset return assumption ) for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and would be revised only when long-term asset return projections demonstrate that need. Pension Plans The net periodic pension benefits cost for the Company pension plans was $29.9 million, $34.4 million and $51.5 million, respectively, in 2005, 2004 and 2003. For 2006, net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be slightly higher than 2005 primarily due to the lower 2005 discount rate, partially offset by the impact of cash contributions to the pension plans in 2005. The recognized net actuarial losses will be higher in 2006 due to the lower discount rate. Actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when the actuarial assumptions used to value the plan obligations are revised from time to time. The Company policy is to amortize only unrecognized net actuarial gains/losses in excess of 10% of the respective plan projected benefit obligation, or fair market value of assets, if greater. The estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2006 is $12.3 million based on the December 31, 2005 unrecognized net actuarial loss presented in Note 13, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, of $314.1 million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years, the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans ( average remaining service period ). Changes to the assumed rates of participant termination, disability and retirement would impact the average remaining service period. An increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect. However, changes to these assumed rates are not anticipated at this time. The 2005 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefits cost was $10.6 million. Projections beyond 2006 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets. The Company used an average discount rate assumption of 5.7%, 6.0% and 6.3% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for its plans. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost. A one 33 percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by $11.1 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by $10.4 million. The Company discount rate represents the estimated rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. In order to estimate this rate, the Company considers the yields of high quality securities which are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency. The duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of the pension plan liabilities. The Company reduced its average discount rate assumption to 5.4% for valuing obligations as of December 31, 2005, from 5.7% as of December 31, 2004, due to the declining interest rate environment. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2005 pension benefits obligations by $140.7 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2005 pension benefits obligations by $121.5 million. Asset return assumptions of 8.5% were used in the calculation of net periodic pension benefits cost for 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefits cost was based on the fair market value of pension plan assets. To determine the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. The historical geometric average return over the 18 years prior to December 31, 2005 was approximately 9.6%. The actual return on assets was 7.8% during 2005, with gains during 2004 and 2003 of approximately 10.7% and 21.1%, respectively. The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly impact net periodic pension benefits cost. A one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by $10.7 million and a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2005 net periodic pension benefits cost by $10.6 million. The Company pension asset investment policies specify ranges of pension asset allocation percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows: equity securities, 40% 85%; debt securities, 15% 60%; and cash and certain other investments, 0% 10%. As of December 31, 2005, the actual allocations were within the ranges. The level of volatility in pension plan asset returns is expected to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes disclosed. For 2005 and 2004, minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material. However, the Company made contributions of $277.5 million in 2005 and $8.0 million in 2004 to improve the funded status. These contributions were fully tax deductible. A one percentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2005 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans. For 2006, there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non-domestic plans will not be material. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Other post-retirement benefits costs relate primarily to health care and life insurance benefits. Net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs for the Company sponsored plans were $24.6 million, $24.3 million and $23.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the calculation of net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs, discount rate assumptions of 5.7%, 6.0% and 6.3% were used for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly impact net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2005 net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs by $1.2 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2005 net periodic other post-retirement benefits costs by $1.3 million. 34 The Company used discount rate assumptions of 5.4% and 5.7% to value the other post-retirement benefits obligations as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2005 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $40.4 million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2005 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $34.5 million. On December 8, 2003, the President of the United States signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the 2003 Medicare Act ). The 2003 Medicare Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare ( Medicare Part D ) as well as a Federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Certain prescription drug benefits offered under the Company post-retirement health care plans qualify for the subsidy under Medicare Part D. The Federal subsidy to be provided by the 2003 Medicare Act reduced net periodic benefits costs beginning in 2004 by approximately $3.0 million and lowered the accumulated post-retirement benefits obligation by approximately $25.2 million. Other critical accounting policies employed by the Company include the following: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Other intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions. The useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and, therefore, these assets are not being amortized. Customer-related intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately ten years. Patents are being amortized over their remaining legal lives of approximately fifteen years. The impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation is performed by using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets) in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives, then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Goodwill was assigned to reporting units and annual impairment tests were performed for goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarters of 2003, 2004 and 2005. No impairment of assets was determined as a result of these tests. 35 Commodities Futures Contracts In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products for anticipated manufacturing requirements and to hedge transportation costs, the Company enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations. Commodities futures contracts utilized by the Company are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The net after-tax impact of cash flow hedging derivatives on comprehensive income (loss) reflected a $6.5 million loss in 2005, a $16.3 million gain in 2004 and a $20.2 million loss in 2003. Net gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were primarily associated with commodities futures contracts. Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to income, for gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives, were reflected in cost of sales. Reclassification of gains of $18.1 million, $26.1 million, and $51.9 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were associated with commodities futures contracts. A before-tax loss of $2.0 million resulting from hedge ineffectiveness on commodities futures contracts was recognized in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. Gains on commodities futures contracts recognized in cost of sales as a result of hedge ineffectiveness were approximately $.4 million and $.4 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income as a result of the discontinuance of a hedge because it became probable that a hedged forecasted transaction would not occur. There were no components of gains or losses on cash flow hedging derivatives that were recognized in income because such components were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately $3.6 million after tax as of December 31, 2005, which were principally associated with commodities futures contracts. RETURN MEASURES Operating Return on Average Stockholders Equity The Company operating return on average stockholders equity, on a GAAP basis, was 45.7% in 2005. The Company adjusted operating return on average stockholders equity was 52.6% in 2005. For the purpose of calculating the adjusted operating return on average stockholders equity, earnings is defined as net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of the amortization of indefinite-lived intangibles for all years and excluding the impact of the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004, the after-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the after-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of the Company in 2002 and the after-tax gains on the sale of a group of the Company gum brands in 2003, the sale of the Luden throat drops business in 2001 and the sale of corporate aircraft in 2000. Over the most recent six-year period, the adjusted return has ranged from 28.8% in 2000 to 52.6% in 2005. Operating Return on Average Invested Capital The Company operating return on average invested capital, on a GAAP basis, was 23.7% in 2005. The Company adjusted operating return on average invested capital was 27.0% in 2005. Average invested capital consists of the annual average of beginning and ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income taxes and stockholders equity. For the purpose of calculating the adjusted operating return on average invested capital, earnings is defined as net income adjusted to reflect the impact of the elimination of the amortization of indefinite-lived intangibles for all years and excluding the impact of the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 36 2004, the after-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the after-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of the Company in 2002, the after-tax gains on the sale of a group of the Company gum brands in 2003, the sale of the Luden throat drops business in 2001, the sale of corporate aircraft in 2000, and the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt. Over the most recent six-year period, the adjusted return has ranged from 16.0% in 2000 to 27.0% in 2005. OUTLOOK The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors on page 7 for information concerning the key risks to achieving future performance goals. During the three years ended December 31, 2005, the Company significantly improved operating results as it implemented its strategies. Over the long-term these strategies seek to deliver average net sales growth of 3% 4% per year, 7% 9% annual growth in earnings before interest expense and income taxes ( EBIT ), improvement in EBIT margin of 90 basis points per year, and 9% 11% earnings per share-diluted ( EPS ) growth per year. The Company expects sales growth in 2006 from benefit-driven innovation, such as the introduction of limited edition items and new products, continued expansion within the total U.S. snack market and a disciplined approach to achieving profitable growth in key global markets. The Company will continue to introduce new items and limited edition line extensions. During 2006 these will include a full year of sales for the following items that were introduced in 2005: Hershey Kisses brand filled with peanut butter, Ice Breakers sour mints, Hershey Kissables brand chocolate candies and Hershey caramel bar. The Company expects year-over-year net sales growth to build throughout 2006 due to the timing of new product shipments, price increases, and shifts in seasonal business early in 2005. Overall growth for the full year 2006 is expected to be somewhat above the Company 3% 4% long-term goal. Geographically, net sales growth is expected to be concentrated primarily in the Americas and selected regions in Asia. The Company intends to focus on growth from its large-scale brands, expand its sales to global customers and develop region-specific business systems. The Company expects higher input costs in 2006, particularly for commodities, transportation and employee benefits. The amount of these cost increases will be subject to changes in market conditions for costs which the Company has not fully hedged. The Company utilizes forward purchasing and commodity futures contracts and maintains a commodity procurement function to assess market fundamentals and develop procurement strategies. The Company expects to offset these cost increases through improved price realization, enhanced trade promotion efficiency, procurement strategies, continued improvements in supply chain efficiency and tight control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. EBIT is expected to grow slightly above the long-term goal of 7% 9% in 2006, excluding items affecting comparability, as a result of net sales growth and gross margin expansion, combined with savings realized from the Company business realignment initiatives, along with careful control of selling, marketing and administrative costs. EBIT margin is expected to improve by approximately 90 basis points in 2006, excluding items affecting comparability. Margin improvement is affected by various factors, including selling prices, promotional allowances, raw material costs, supply chain efficiencies and the mix of products sold in any period. During 2006, EBIT margin expansion is expected from improved price realization resulting from a combination of selling price increases and product weight changes and from increased sales to more profitable channels, such as convenience stores, mass merchandisers, drug stores and specialty stores. In addition, enhanced effectiveness in trade promotion spending focused on fewer brands with greater reach and reduced selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to contribute to margin expansion in 2006. Gross margin is expected to increase modestly in 2006 from improved price realization and supply chain efficiencies 37 as the Company continues to leverage its existing manufacturing capacity and distribution infrastructure. A reduction in selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is anticipated from leveraging the Company sales force capabilities without increasing costs and from combining various administrative functions in the Company North American operations. These initiatives are expected to more than offset the impact of higher input costs, primarily for raw materials, transportation and employee benefits. Net income and EPS in 2005 were unfavorably impacted by the 2005 business realignment initiatives recorded in the third and fourth quarters. Excluding the impact of the 2005 business realignment initiatives, net income and EPS are expected to increase slightly above the range of the Company long-term goals for the full year 2006. The Company expects strong cash flows from operating activities in 2006. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. The Company will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate. The plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2005. The Company does not anticipate significant pension plan contributions in 2006. The Company plans to repurchase approximately $575 million of its common stock in 2006 to be funded by cash provided from operations and additional borrowings.
