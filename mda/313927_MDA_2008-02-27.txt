ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ( MD&A ) Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements. Overview The Company develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products. It recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands, including ARM & HAMMER and TROJAN, to consumers through supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers; and to industrial customers and distributors. The Company operates in three primary segments, Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products. The Consumer Domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing such as ARM & HAMMER baking soda and cat litter products; laundry and cleaning products, such as XTRA and ARM & HAMMER laundry detergents, OXICLEAN, and SCRUB FREE and BRILLO cleaning products; and personal care products, such as TROJAN condoms, NAIR depilatories and waxes, FIRST RESPONSE and ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant and ARM & HAMMER, MENTADENT, CLOSE-UP, PEPSODENT and AIM toothpastes, as well as SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes. Our Consumer International segment sells a variety of personal care, and to a lesser extent household, products, some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines, in international markets, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Spain and China. Our Specialty Products ( SPD ) segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, our Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products segments represented approximately 71%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of net sales. On August 7, 2006, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Orange Glo International ( the OGI business ) which includes laundry and cleaning products such as OXICLEAN, a premium-priced laundry pre-wash additive, KABOOM bathroom cleaner and ORANGE GLO household cleaner ( the OGI acquisition ). The Company paid approximately $325.4 million, plus fees of approximately $4.4 million, which was financed through a $250.0 million addition to its existing bank credit facility and available cash. The Company allocated a significant portion of the purchase price to intangible assets, which is reflected in the accompanying financial statements. On June 2, 2006, the Company reacquired from USA Detergents ( USAD ) the distribution rights to sell Xtra laundry detergent and Nice N Fluffy liquid fabric softener in Canada for $7.0 million. The acquisition was funded out of the Company available cash. The accompanying financial statements reflect the final asset allocation, which assigned the purchase price to intangible assets. On October 31, 2005, the Company acquired the SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrush business from The Procter & Gamble Company ( P&G ). This acquisition was funded from $75.0 million of the Company available cash. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the Company results of operations commencing with their respective acquisition dates. Continuing a trend that began in 2005, the cost of raw materials was substantially higher in 2007, particularly for soda ash, diesel fuel, corrugated paper, liner board and oil-based raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses. Moreover, the price of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil, was substantially higher in 2007. The Company offset these increases in 2007 through savings realized in cost improvement programs and an indexed 21 Table of Contents price increase in the animal nutrition market. Additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the Company costs and financial results if the Company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers. The Company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets, in which cost efficiency, new product offerings and innovation are critical to success. The consumer products markets are particularly mature in North America and are characterized by high household penetration, particularly with respect to the Company most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care. Furthermore, because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers, the Company faces pricing pressure from these customers, particularly the high-volume retail store customers, who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. To protect its existing market share or to capture additional market share, the Company increased expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduced new products and line extensions. In order to fund the additional marketing expenses, the Company has and continues to pursue ongoing cost cutting initiatives. Furthermore, through its acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives, the Company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities. Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, our observation of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves Virtually all of the Company revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers, (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $1.9 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the Company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $5.6 million. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $5.4 million, $4.5 million and $8.1 million, respectively based on actual experience and updated information. 22 Table of Contents Impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The Company impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. The Company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling, general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended December 31, 2007 as follows: Segments: 2007 2006 2005 Consumer Domestic $ $ 11.0 $ 3.2 Consumer International 4.2 3.3 3.1 Total $ 4.2 $ 14.3 $ 6.3 The tradename impairment charges were recorded as a result of lost distribution at key customer accounts and, to a lesser extent, reduced profitability. The amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair value was estimated based on a relief from royalty discounted cash flow method. Under this method, the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party. The Company determined the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands. The impact of the reduction in profitability was not material to the consolidated financial statements. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . The Company impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of Company assets and liabilities. The analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company recognized charges related to equipment obsolescence, which occur in the ordinary course of business, and plant impairment charges during the three year period ended December 31, 2007 as follows: Segments: 2007 2006 2005 Consumer Domestic $ 2.8 $ 1.7 $ 4.6 Consumer International 0.4 0.5 5.7 SPD 0.1 0.3 3.2 Total $ 3.3 $ 2.5 $ 13.5 23 Table of Contents The estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken. Future outcomes may also differ materially from management estimates. If the Company products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Inventory valuation When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value which includes any costs to sell or dispose). The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company products, technological changes, and new product introductions. In addition, the Company allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units ( SKU ). The Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to the inventory net realizable value were $9.7 million at December 31, 2007, and $8.8 million at December 31, 2006. Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs The Company pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to an applicable index and expected cash flows to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled. Based on the published rate as of December 31, 2007 that matched our estimated cash flows for the plans, the Company used a discount rate of 6.25% for its domestic plan. The Company weighted average discount rate for all plans as of December 31, 2007 is 5.98% as compared to 5.38% used at December 31, 2006. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the Company weighted average expected long-term rate for the 2007 year is 7.19%, an increase of 39 basis points from the 6.80% rate used at December 31, 2006. This increase is principally due to an increase in expected returns in the U.K. pension plans. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in less than a $0.6 million change in pension expense for 2008. In 2007, the change in other comprehensive income due to SFAS No. 158 (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements below) was $8.5 million and $2.3 million for pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the adjustment to initially apply SFAS No. 158 to the balance sheet was an increase to the 2007 pension and postretirement accrued benefit liabilities of $0.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The amounts were recorded, net of tax, directly to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income and not as a component of comprehensive income, in accordance with the new standard. This change is primarily related to the change in the assumed discount rate. 24 Table of Contents The Company made cash contributions of approximately $9.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2007. The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately $6.7 million in 2008. Tax contingencies Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely than not to be realized. The Company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under FIN 48 (see Recent Accounting Pronouncements below). The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities. The Company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ). FIN 48 clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under FIN 48, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position should not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, declassification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2007. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was $18.5 million, which was recorded in other long-term liabilities. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized an $8.3 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as follows: (In millions) Increase in net deferred tax assets $ 9.6 Increase in noncurrent receivables 2.4 Increase in retained earnings (cumulative effect) (2.5 ) Increase in noncurrent accrued interest payables (1.2 ) Increase in liability for unrecognized tax benefits $ 8.3 Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007, is $6.9 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized approximately $4.3 million in tax expenses associated with uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has a long term tax liability of $27.8 million (excluding interest) related to 25 Table of Contents uncertain tax positions. The Company does not anticipate that the settlement of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations within the next twelve months will result in a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as the income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. All U.S. federal income tax examinations of the Company for the years through 2003 have been effectively concluded. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that its federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 had been selected for examination. Substantially all material state, local and foreign income tax matters have been effectively concluded for years through 2000. In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, the Company changed its policy for recording interest on certain unrecognized tax benefits from tax expense to interest expense. The Company policy for recording interest associated with income tax examinations is to record interest as a component of income before taxes. Interest paid or received is recorded in interest expense or interest income, respectively, in the statement of income. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized approximately $1.6 million in interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $2.7 million. SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , was issued in September 2006 and, under FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) FAS No. 157-b, is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS No. 157 provides a single definition of fair value to be utilized under other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement generally is to be applied prospectively, so that it does not require any new fair value measurements During the fourth quarter of 2007, the FASB Board deferred the effective date of the statement for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 , was issued on February 15, 2007, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. If the fair value option is elected, a company will report unrealized gains and losses on those assets and liabilities in each subsequent reporting date. The Company has concluded that SFAS No. 159 will not have an effect on its existing financial assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2007. As of the adoption date, the Company has not changed its accounting for any eligible instruments. SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 , was issued in December 2007 and is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No.160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest (sometimes called minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on its consolidated statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141(R) ), to replace SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141(R) requires use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer, establishes the acquisition date and broadens the scope to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 with earlier adoption prohibited. While the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 141(R) to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements for transactions completed prior to December 31, 2008, the impact of the accounting change could be material for business combinations which may be consummated subsequent thereto. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005 The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment. The discussion of our segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information. The Company reporting units are consistent with its reportable segments. Consolidated results 2007 compared to 2006 Net Sales Net Sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2,220.9 million, $275.3 million or 14.1% above last year. The increase is largely due to the impact of the business acquired in the OGI acquisition, which occurred in August 2006, and the SPINBRUSH toothbrush business, which collectively accounted for approximately 8% of the increase in net sales; the effect of foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately 1% of the increase. The balance of the increase is a result of unit volume increases partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses. Following the acquisition of the SPINBRUSH business in December 2005 and during the transition period prior to April 1, 2006, the seller of the SPINBRUSH business maintained responsibility for sales and other functions in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; therefore, the Company accounted for the net cash received as other revenue. The Company assumed responsibility for all SPINBRUSH functions in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. on April 1, 2006, and has recognized the gross amount of sales and expenses from the SPINBRUSH business for the U.S. and foreign locations since that date. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $867.9 million during 2007, a $106.8 million increase as compared to 2006. The Company gross margin remained unchanged at 39.1% compared to 2006. Gross profit reflects the impact of the OGI business, higher sales volume and foreign exchange rates, offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses. Gross profit also includes the impact of continuing price increases for resins, corrugated paper, liner board, soda ash, diesel fuel, palm fatty acid distillate ( PFAD ) and other raw materials, offset by cost reduction programs. Marketing expenses for 2007 were $256.7 million, an increase of $40.1 million as compared to 2006. The increase principally was due to support acquired businesses, an increase in expenses for certain personal care products and the effect of foreign exchange rates. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for 2007 were $306.1 million, an increase of $13.7 million as compared to 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher selling expenses in support of higher sales, ongoing costs to support the acquired OGI business, higher information systems costs, higher legal expense, costs to reorganize the Company Canadian subsidiary and the effect of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a $3.3 million gain associated with the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by lower intangible asset impairment charges in 2007 of $4.2 million, as compared to $14.3 million in 2006. Other Income and Expenses In 2007, equity in earnings of affiliates was $8.2 million as compared to $7.1 million in 2006. The increase is primarily due to the earnings of the Esseco U.K. LLP joint venture which was started in April 2006 and improved profitability of Armand products. Other income was approximately $2.5 million in 2007 as compared to other expense of $2.6 million in 2006. Other income in both years principally reflect foreign exchange gains and losses. Also, in 2006, other income/expense included the fair market value of common stock the Company received in connection with the 27 Table of Contents demutualization of an insurance company in which the Company was the policyholder of a guaranteed annuity contract associated with a defined benefit plan. Interest expense in 2007 increased $4.9 million as compared to 2006. This increase reflects expense associated with the debt used to finance the OGI acquisition in August 2006, partially offset by lower bank debt due to mandatory and voluntary debt payments. Investment earnings increased $2.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of higher cash available for investment. Taxation The 2007 tax rate was 36.2% as compared to 34.8% in 2006. The 2007 tax rate reflects a charge of $3.2 million, relating to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for one of the Company foreign subsidiaries and also reflects a $1.8 million benefit due to the reduction of tax liabilities in the U.K. and Australia. The effective tax rate in 2006 reflects a $3.3 million reduction of tax liabilities primarily as a result of the completion of tax audits, offset by a valuation allowance of $1.5 million on deferred tax assets for one of the Company foreign subsidiaries. Consolidated results 2006 compared to 2005 Net Sales Net Sales increased $209.2 million or 12.0% to $1,945.7 million, compared to $1,736.5 million in 2005. Included in the 2006 results are $180.5 million associated with the acquisitions of the SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrush business, a skin care brand in Brazil, and the OGI business. The Company assumed responsibility for all SPINBRUSH sales and other functions in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. on April 1, 2006, and has recognized the gross amount of sales and expenses from the SPINBRUSH business for the U.S. and foreign locations since that date. During the transition period prior to April 1, 2006, when the seller of the SPINBRUSH business maintained these responsibilities, the Company accounted for the net cash received as other revenue. The full year results were also affected by favorable foreign exchange rates of $6.8 million, reduction of promotion reserves of $4.5 million, based on updated information, including actual experience, price increases that became effective February 1, 2006 and lower volumes. Due to the timing of previously planned promotional events, especially for laundry products, the full benefit of the price increases were not realized until the second quarter of 2006. The Company estimates that the effect of increased prices affected net sales by approximately 3%. Lower volumes reduced sales by less than 2%. Operating Costs The Company gross profit increased by $124.1 million to $761.1 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 and its gross margin increased 240 basis points to 39.1% in 2006 from 36.7% in 2005. Approximately 110 basis points of the improvement was associated with the acquired businesses and the balance of the increase is primarily due to the effect of price increases and cost improvement programs of approximately 350 basis points, partially offset by an increase in commodity costs over the past year of approximately 290 basis points, particularly for oil-based raw and packaging materials used in the laundry and specialty products businesses. Gross margin in 2005 was negatively affected by a charge associated with the closure of a sub-scale, consumer products manufacturing operation abroad, and plant impairment and equipment obsolescence charges. The absence of these charges in 2006 helped improve gross margin by 50 basis points. Marketing expenses for 2006 increased $33.2 million as compared to 2005, primarily due to support for acquired businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) of $292.4 million in 2006 increased $51.6 million or 21.4% as compared to 2005. The 2006 expense includes tradename impairment charges of $14.3 million, stock 28 Table of Contents based compensation expense of $9.3 million primarily associated with the Company adoption of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, an increase of approximately $10.0 million of fixed and variable personnel and related expenses, higher deferred compensation expenses of $2.6 million, higher variable selling expense associated with higher net sales of $4.3 million, higher research and development professional fee expenses of $3.9 million and operating and amortization expense in support of the acquired businesses. The prior year includes $6.3 million of tradename impairment charges and an $8.3 million charge related to litigation involving Andes Trading de Mexico S.A. (the Andes litigation ). For additional information, see Note 16c of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Other Income and Expenses The increase in equity in earnings of affiliates of $2.3 million reflects improved operating margins associated with the Company Armand Products joint venture and the formation of a small joint venture by one of the Company European subsidiaries. Interest expense in 2006 increased $9.9 million as compared to 2005 as a result of the increase in debt to fund the OGI acquisition and higher interest rates partially offset by lower average pre-existing debt outstanding. Investment income for 2006 increased $1.3 million as compared to 2005 as a result of higher interest rates. Other income/expense in 2006 primarily includes the fair market value of common stock the Company received in connection with the demutualization of an insurance company in which the Company was the policyholder of a guaranteed annuity contract associated with a defined benefit plan, and foreign exchange gains related to intercompany loans between the Company subsidiaries. In 2005, the Company reported foreign exchange losses associated with these loans. Net loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2005 of $1.2 million is associated with the fourth quarter 2005 refinancing of the Company term loan. Taxation The effective tax rate for 2006 was 34.8%, compared to 29.8% in 2005. The 2006 tax rate includes a $4.2 million reduction of tax liabilities primarily as a result of the completion of a prior year federal tax audit, partially offset by a partial valuation allowance of $1.9 million for one of the Company foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax in 2005 reflects a $7.4 million reduction of tax liabilities of which $6.2 million relates to the expiration of the statute of limitations in connection with certain tax positions and $1.2 million was due to a lower effective state tax rate. Segment results for 2007, 2006 and 2005 The Company maintains three reportable segments. These segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. Specifically, the Company has identified the following segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products Division ( SPD ). The Company also has a Corporate segment. Segment revenues are derived from the sale of the following products: Segment Products Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products Consumer International Primarily personal care products Specialty Products Specialty chemical products The Company had 50% ownership interests in Armand Products Company ( Armand ), The ArmaKleen Company ( Armakleen ), and Esseco U.K. LLP ( Esseco ) as of December 31, 2007. Since the Company did 29 Table of Contents not control these entities as of December 31, 2007, they were accounted for under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The equity earnings of Armand, Armakleen and Esseco are included in the Corporate segment. Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment. These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results. The domestic results of operations for the OGI business are included in the Consumer Domestic segment. The results of operations for the OGI business foreign operations are included in the Consumer International segment. Segment sales and income before taxes and minority interest for each of the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows; (Dollars in thousands) Consumer Domestic Consumer International SPD Corporate Total Net Sales 2007 $ 1,574,130 $ 388,286 $ 258,524 $ $ 2,220,940 2006 1,388,500 336,868 220,293 1,945,661 2005 1,218,221 297,241 221,044 1,736,506 Income Before Taxes & Minority Interest (1) 2007 $ 207,152 $ 33,192 $ 16,351 $ 8,236 $ 264,931 2006 166,490 25,305 14,164 7,135 213,094 2005 142,669 14,322 14,343 3,549 174,883 (1) Income Before Minority Interest and Income Taxes reflects the allocation of interest expense, investment earnings, and other income (expense) to the segments based upon the segments relative operating profit. Product line revenues for external customers for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: (In thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Household Products $ 1,001,376 $ 832,957 $ 713,489 Personal Care Products 572,754 555,543 504,732 Total Consumer Domestic 1,574,130 1,388,500 1,218,221 Total Consumer International 388,286 336,868 297,241 Total SPD 258,524 220,293 221,044 Total Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,220,940 $ 1,945,661 $ 1,736,506 Consumer Domestic 2007 compared to 2006 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2007 were $1,574.1 million, an increase of $185.6 million or approximately 13% compared to 2006. The increase is primarily due to the OGI acquisition, which contributed approximately 9% of the increase, and higher unit volume, partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses in support of new product launches. Sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, which include sales for the first phase of the Company shift to concentrated liquid detergent, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter, TROJAN condoms, ARM & HAMMER Dental Care and pregnancy test kits were all higher than in 2006. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of other toothpaste brands and antiperspirant sales. Consumer Domestic Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes in 2007 was $207.2 million, an increase of $40.7 million as compared to 2006. Profits resulting from the OGI business and higher volumes were partially offset by higher trade promotion, slotting expenses and marketing costs on pre-existing products, higher SG&A expenses, and higher interest expense resulting from the OGI acquisition. 30 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005 Consumer Domestic net sales were $1,388.5 million in 2006, an increase of $170.3 million or 14.0% as compared to 2005. The increase is primarily due to sales of SPINBRUSH and OGI products. These acquisitions contributed approximately $155.0 million of incremental net sales. The Company assumed responsibility for all SPINBRUSH sales and other functions in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. on April 1, 2006, and recognized the gross amount of sales and expenses from the SPINBRUSH business within the consolidated statement of earnings for the U.S. and most foreign locations during the second quarter. During the transition period prior to April 1, 2006, when the seller of the SPINBRUSH business maintained these responsibilities, the Company accounted for the net cash received as other revenue. Sales of the segment pre-existing product lines increased slightly as a result of higher prices, partially offset by slightly lower volume. Effective February 1, 2006, the Company implemented price increases ranging from 4% to over 10% for products representing about 35% of its U.S. consumer products portfolio net sales. These products include ARM & HAMMER and XTRA liquid laundry detergents, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter and ARM & HAMMER baking soda. Management believes the price increase caused the Company to experience lower product demand as consumers adjusted to the higher prices. However, management believes that these price increases have improved the Company margins and contributed to achieving its financial goals. Higher sales also reflected growth in liquid laundry detergents, pregnancy kits and pet care, and the reduction of promotion reserves of $2.7 million, based on updated information, including actual experience, partially offset by lower toothpaste and deodorant sales. Consumer Domestic Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes was $166.5 million in 2006, a $23.8 million increase as compared to 2005. The increase is primarily due to the contributions from OGI and SPINBRUSH products and the effect of higher gross margins for liquid laundry detergents. The higher profitability was partially offset by higher oil-based manufacturing and freight costs and higher SG&A expenses (primarily stock option expense, higher personnel related expenses, higher research and development costs, higher legal and professional fees and costs associated with the OGI and SPINBRUSH businesses). The segment profitability was also negatively impacted by tradename and equipment obsolescence charges of $13.5 million in 2006 and an increase in intangible assets amortization and higher allocated interest expense. Consumer International 2007 compared to 2006 Consumer International net sales in 2007 were $388.3 million, an increase of $51.4 million, or approximately 15% as compared to 2006. Of the increase, approximately 3% is associated with the OGI and SPINBRUSH acquisitions, 8% is associated with favorable foreign exchange rates and the balance is associated with higher sales of personal care and household products in Canada, skin care and oral care products in France, skin care products in Australia, oral care products in the UK and depilatory products in Brazil and a reduction of promotion reserves of $2.9 million, based upon updated information including actual expense, partially offset by reduced sales resulting from the loss of a distribution arrangement to sell certain personal care products in the UK. Consumer International Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes in 2007 was $33.2 million, a $7.9 million increase as compared to 2006. The increase is a result of higher profits associated with sales in Canada, France, Australia and Brazil, and the contribution from the OGI business. Results in 2007 include a $3.3 million gain associated with the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary offset by tradename impairment charges of $4.2 million and a $3.5 million charge relating to the reorganization of the Company Canadian business. Intangible asset impairment charges were $3.3 million in 2006. 2006 compared to 2005 Consumer International net sales were $336.9 million in 2006, an increase of $39.6 million or 13.3% as compared to 2005. The 2006 net sales reflect $25.7 million associated with the OGI and SPINBRUSH products 31 Table of Contents and the skin care product acquired late in 2005, favorable exchange rates of $6.9 million and the reduction of promotion reserves of $1.8 million, based on updated information, including actual experience. Other products in the segment experienced slight volume and pricing gains. Strong sales in Canada, U.K. and Australia were offset by lower sales of certain skin care brands in Europe. Consumer International Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes was $25.3 million in 2006, an increase of $11.0 million as compared to 2005. The increase is a result of the contribution from the products of the acquired businesses. Moreover, the 2005 period reflected a litigation charge of $8.3 million and a $6.4 million restructuring charge (which includes both severance and asset impairment charges) associated with the closure of a consumer packaged goods plant at one of its international locations. Partially offsetting the increase were higher manufacturing and distribution costs, an unfavorable sales mix (more lower margin household products), and an increase in marketing expenses in England in support of certain personal care products. Both years include tradename impairment charges which totaled $3.3 million in 2006 and $3.0 million in 2005. Specialty Products 2007 compared to 2006 Specialty Products net sales were $258.5 million in 2007, an increase of $38.2 million, or 17% as compared to 2006. The increase is due to higher unit volumes and improved pricing in both animal nutrition and specialty chemicals. The animal nutrition sales increase also reflects a pricing surcharge of $3.5 million enacted during the third quarter of 2007 on certain products which partially recover extraordinary cost increases for PFAD. Specialty Products Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes was $16.4 million in 2007, an increase of $2.2 million as compared to 2006. The increase is principally the result of profits on higher net sales, partially offset by higher PFAD and soda ash costs. 2006 compared to 2005 Specialty Products net sales were $220.3 million for 2006, a decrease of $0.8 million as compared to 2005. The decrease is due to lower volumes, particularly animal nutrition products, largely offset by higher selling prices for specialty chemicals. Specialty Products Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes were $14.2 million in 2006, essentially unchanged from 2005. This principally reflects higher manufacturing costs for certain animal nutrition products, increased SG&A expenses and higher allocated interest expense, offset by the effect of higher prices. In 2005, Specialty Products Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes included fixed asset impairment charges at the segment foreign operations of $3.2 million. Liquidity and capital resources Net Debt The Company had outstanding total debt of $856.0 million and cash and cash equivalents of $249.8 million (of which approximately $71.9 million resides in foreign subsidiaries) at December 31, 2007. Total debt less cash ( net debt ) was $606.2 million at December 31, 2007. This compares to total debt of $933.3 million and cash of $110.5 million, resulting in net debt of $822.8 million at December 31, 2006. Year Ending December 31, (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Cash Flow Analysis: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 248,677 $ 186,444 $ 190,107 Net cash used in investing activities (42,522 ) (385,516 ) (105,114 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (73,619 ) 177,653 (101,224 ) 32 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operations in 2007 increased $62.3 million to $248.7 million as compared to $186.4 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher net income, higher depreciation and amortization expense, higher non-cash stock compensation expense and increases in deferred income taxes and income taxes payable that were offset by other working capital changes. The Company anticipates that its cash from operations will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs, pay its dividends at current rates and meet its mandatory debt repayment schedule over the next twelve months. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the components of working capital that significantly impacted operating cash flow are as follows: Cash used by accounts receivable was $6.9 million in 2007 due to the Company strong fourth quarter net sales, which were 10% higher than the fourth quarter of 2006. Accounts receivable increased by $14.3 million in 2006 as compared to fiscal year end 2005. This increase was largely due to the Company strong fourth quarter net sales, which were 22% higher than the fourth quarter of 2005 and were primarily associated with the OGI and SPINBRUSH acquisitions. In 2005, accounts receivable increased by $28.4 million as compared to 2004. The increase was largely due to the Company strong fourth quarter net sales, which were 6.5% higher than the fourth quarter of 2004. Cash used by inventories was $13.8 million in 2007, primarily due to support of higher anticipated sales. Inventories increased in 2006 by $38.8 million due to the OGI and SPINBRUSH acquisitions. Inventories increased in 2005 by $9.8 million due to the impact of higher raw and packaging costs experienced in 2005, inventory in support of the ELEXA brand and the need to support higher sales. Cash used by accounts payable, taxes payable and other accrued liabilities was $16.9 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased marketing interest and tax expenses and the timing of invoice payments partially offset by the $10.4 million litigation settlement described in Note 16 (c) to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. The net decrease of $6.2 million in accounts payable, taxes payable and other liabilities in 2006 is related to the timing of payments related to increased payables at December 31, 2005. The net increase of $34.3 million in accounts payable, taxes payable and other liabilities in 2005 includes the additional reserve recorded in connection with the Andes litigation of $8.3 million and the timing of tax payments. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2007 was $42.5 million, reflecting $48.9 million of additions for property, plant and equipment. Offsetting these investing activities were proceeds received from the sale of Canadian property of $7.2 million. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 of $385.5 million reflected $337.5 million utilized for the OGI acquisition and the USAD Canadian distribution rights and $47.6 million in property, plant and equipment. Cash used in investing activities in 2005 of $105.1 million reflected $81.1 million utilized for the acquisitions of SPINBRUSH and a skin care product in South America, and investments of $37.7 million in property, plant and equipment. These uses of cash in 2005 were partially offset by proceeds of $14.7 million associated mainly with the sale of the Company former Cranbury facility. The Company anticipates 2008 additions to property, plant and equipment to be approximately $55 million. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during 2007 was $73.6 million. This reflects voluntary and mandatory payments on the Term Loan of $90.0 million and the payment of cash dividends of $19.7 million. Offsetting these transactions were an increase of $15.0 million in short-term borrowings related to the Company accounts receivable securitization facility (which was used to make voluntary term loan payments), and proceeds of and tax benefits from stock option exercises of $23.8 million. During 2006 the Company increased its total amount of debt by $176.8 million. The increase resulted from $250.0 million borrowed to fund the OGI acquisition and making both voluntary and mandatory debt repayments of $72.9 million. In addition, the Company paid cash dividends of $16.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds and tax benefits on stock option exercises of $19.8 million. During 2005, net cash used in 33 Table of Contents financing activities was $101.2 million. This represented term loan voluntary debt payments of $100.0 million, the redemption of all the remaining 9 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes of $6.4 million and the payments of dividends of $15.3 million. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $17.2 million. The Company entered into two cash flow hedge agreements, each covering $100.0 million of zero cost collars, one effective as of September 29, 2006, and the other effective as of December 29, 2006, to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its term loan debt. The hedge agreements have terms of five and three years, respectively, each with a cap of 6.50% and a floor of 3.57%. There was no income statement impact resulting from these agreements as all changes in the hedging options fair value are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. On December 23, 2005, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a number of banks and other financial institutions. This amended and restated Credit Agreement initially provided for a five year Term Loan A in a principal amount of $300.0 million, subject to an increase by up to an additional $250.0 million through an accordion feature upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, and continued the existing five year multi-currency revolving credit and letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million. On August 7, 2006, the Company existing bank credit facility was amended and increased by $250.0 million, which the Company used to fund the OGI acquisition while maintaining the $250 million accordion feature. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. Those domestic subsidiaries have also guaranteed the loan obligations under the Credit Agreement. Certain of the covenants in the amended and restated credit agreement were also modified. The Term Loan and the Revolving Loans bear interest under one of two rate options, selected by the Company, equal to (a) either (i) a eurocurrency rate (adjusted for any reserve requirements) ( Eurocurrency Rate ) or (ii) the greater of the prime rate, the secondary market rate for three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for any reserve requirements) plus the applicable FDIC assessment rate plus 1.0%, or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% ( Alternate Base Rate ), plus (b) an applicable margin. On the closing date of the new agreement, the applicable margin was (a) 1.00% for the Eurocurrency rate and (b) 0% for the alternate rate. The term loan was used to refinance the Company Term Loan B and the revolving loans are available for general corporate purposes. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statement for additional information. 34 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the Company primary credit facility. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the Company ability to service its indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Financial covenants include a total debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, which if not met, could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility, if not remedied within a specific period of time. Adjusted EBITDA was $374.4 million for 2007. The leverage ratio (total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) was 2.26 which is below the maximum of 3.75 permitted under the credit facility, and the interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense) for 2007 was 6.36 which is above the minimum of 3.0 permitted under the credit facility. The Company obligations under the credit facility are secured by the assets of the Company and certain domestic subsidiaries. The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for 2007 is as follows (in millions): Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 248.7 Interest Expense 58.9 Current Income Tax Provision 79.4 Excess Tax Benefit on Stock Options Exercised 7.7 Change in Working Capital and Other Liabilities (2.0 ) Investment Income (8.1 ) Litigation Settlement (Note 16c) (10.4 ) Other 0.2 Adjusted EBITDA (per loan agreement) $ 374.4 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities $ (42.5 ) Net Cash Used in Financing Activities $ (73.6 ) Commitments as of December 31, 2007 The table below summarizes the Company material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007.

The Company must pay cash for any debentures repurchased on August 15, 2010. The Company may choose to pay cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash or shares of its common stock for any debentures repurchased on August 15, 2013, August 15, 2018, August 15, 2023 or August 15, 2028 or following a change in control. The Company has the right to redeem all or part of the debentures on or after August 15, 2008. (2) Represents interest on the Company 5.25% senior convertible debentures due 2033 and interest on the 6% senior subordinated notes due in 2012. The Company did not include interest expense on its variable rate debt as it cannot predict future interest rates. (3) Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for items such as insurance claims in the event of the Company insolvency, one year of lease payments on a warehouse and certain inventory purchases. (4) Pension contributions are based on actuarial assessments of government regulated employer funding requirements per plan. These requirements are not projected beyond one year since they fluctuate with the change in plan assets, assumptions and demographics. (5) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2007 for raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and do not represent total anticipated purchases. The Company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities as defined in FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , due to the uncertainty of the amount per period of payment. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has gross uncertain tax liabilities, including interest, of $30.5 million (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Financial Condition The Company generally relies on operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings to meet its financing requirements. The Company broad product portfolio, strong brand names and market positions have provided a stable base of cash flow. The Company broad product line is marketed through multiple distribution channels. The Company believes that, as is the case with other basic consumer products, consumers purchase most of its products largely independent of economic cycles. However, the Company ability to meet its financial obligations depends on successful financial and operating performance. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve such performance, which depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors include: Competitive conditions in the categories of the consumer products industry in which the Company competes; The Company ability to retain certain principal customers, such as Wal-Mart; Operating difficulties, operating costs or pricing pressures the Company may experience; Passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that affect the Company adversely; Delays in implementing any strategic projects; and Current geo-political events. 36 Table of Contents The Company has a total debt-to-capital ratio of approximately 44%. At December 31, 2007 the Company had $91.0 million of additional borrowing capacity available through the revolving loans under its Credit Agreement and a $250.0 million accordion feature associated with the Term Loan. Management believes that operating cash flow, coupled with the Company access to credit markets, will be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash requirements for the coming year. OTHER ITEMS Market risk Concentration of Risk In each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, net sales to the Company largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates were 22%, 21% and 18%, respectively, of the Company total consolidated net sales. Interest Rate Risk The Company has total debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 of $856.0 million, of which $349.9 million or 41% carries a fixed rate of interest. The remaining debt balance is primarily comprised of $391.1 million in term loans under the Credit Agreement and $115.0 million outstanding under the receivables purchase agreement. The weighted average interest rate on all these borrowings at December 31, 2007, excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees, was approximately 5.8%. The Company entered into two cash flow hedge agreements, each covering $100.0 million of zero cost collars, one effective as of September 29, 2006, and the other effective as of December 29, 2006, to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its term loan debt. The hedge agreements have terms of five and three years, respectively, each with a cap of 6.50% and a floor of 3.57%. There was no income statement impact resulting from these agreements as all changes in the hedging options fair value are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. If the variable rate on the Company floating rate debt outstanding on December 31, 2007 were to change by 100 basis points from the December 31, 2007 level, annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would change by approximately $5.1 million. Commodity Risk In order to reduce the purchase price risk resulting from the variability of fuel prices, the Company has, from time to time, entered into short-term hedges for diesel fuel. The fixed price for these hedges is based on the Diesel Fuel-EIA Index, and is subsequently measured each month against the average price of On-Highway diesel fuel per the same index, which is published weekly. Differences between the hedges fixed price and the average of the weekly prices within a month, are recorded in cost of sales as incurred. During 2007, the Company placed hedges for approximately 40% of its annual requirements at a cost of $0.4 million, and there were no hedges outstanding at December 31, 2007. Foreign Currency The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S. Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar/Chinese Yuan. The Company currently has intercompany loans with certain of its subsidiaries. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange accounting remeasurement gains and losses from these intercompany loans. The Company 37 Table of Contents previously entered into several foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net accounting remeasurement exposure on these loans. However, at December 31, 2007, the Company had no outstanding hedges. The purpose of the Company foreign currency hedging activities was to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflows or outflows would be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and were marked to market in Other Expenses in the Company Income Statement. The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the Euro. There were no contracts at December 31, 2007 to hedge these transactions and the Company had no outstanding material contracts at December 31, 2007. The Company is also subject to translation exposure of the Company foreign subsidiaries financial statements. A hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar to the currencies noted above at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would result in an annual currency translation gain or loss of approximately $2.9 million in 2007 and $2.3 million in 2006. Equity Derivatives The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in the liability to plan participants for contributions designated to Company stock in the Company deferred compensation plan as a result of changes in quoted fair values. These contracts, which consist of cash settled call options in the amount of 203 thousand shares, covered approximately 75% of the notional shares in the plan and are marked to market through earnings. As a result of these contracts, the Company recognized income (expense) of approximately $0.9 million in 2007, $1.2 million in 2006, and ($0.3) million in 2005, which reduced (increased) the total charge for deferred compensation, which is included in SG&A expense. Related Party Transactions The Company divested the USA Detergents non-laundry business and other non-core assets to former USA Detergents executives in connection with its acquisition of USA Detergents in 2001. The Company has a $0.6 million ownership interest in the business operated by the former USA Detergents executives, also known as USA Detergents ( USAD ). The Company has been supplying USAD with certain laundry and cleaning products at cost plus a mark-up, and USAD had the exclusive rights to sell these products in Canada. In addition, the Company leases office and laboratory space to USAD under a separate agreement. On June 2, 2006, the Company reacquired from USAD the distribution rights to XTRA laundry detergent and NICE N FLUFFY liquid fabric softener in Canada for $7.0 million and agreed to make an additional performance based payment of a maximum of $2.5 million based upon Canadian sales of these products during the one year period following the closing date. Based on the performance of the business, no additional payments were required. During 2007 and 2006, the Company sold $5.6 and $15.8 million, respectively, of laundry and cleaning products to USAD. Furthermore, the Company billed USAD $0.1 million and $0.2 million for leased space in 2007 and 2006 respectively.
