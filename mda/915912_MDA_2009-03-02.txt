ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends as described more fully under Forward-Looking Statements included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in Item 1a, Risk Factors, of this report. Executive Overview Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. Barriers-to-entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are located in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our strategy is to penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer. Our communities are predominately upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. Financial Highlights and Outlook For the year ended December 31, 2008, net income available to common stockholders was $401,033,000 compared to $349,460,000 for 2007, an increase of 14.8%. The annual year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in gains from the sale of communities and joint venture real estate investments in 2008 as compared to 2007 and growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2008, partially offset by non-cash charges for land impairments, abandoned pursuit costs and other charges related to our reduction in our planned development activity and other items listed in the table below. 40 Net Income and EPS/FFO Decrease (Increase) Full Year 2008 Amount Per Share (1) Land impairments $ 57,899,000 $ 0.75 Severance and related costs 3,400,000 0.04 Federal excise tax 3,200,000 0.04 Fund II organizational costs 1,209,000 0.02 Gain on medium term notes repurchase (1,839,000 ) (0.02 ) Preferred stock deferred offering expenses 3,566,000 0.05 Increase in abandoned pursuit costs 5,537,000 0.07 $ 72,972,000 $ 0.94 (1) Per share amounts are computed using the weighted average common shares-diluted at December 31, 2008. Apartment fundamentals, while in line with expectations, were challenged in the second half of 2008 as the recent economic downturn accelerated. We were able to achieve full year-over-year rental revenue growth of 3.1% for our Established Community portfolio, comprised entirely of an increase in rental rates of 3.1%, with no change in occupancy. This revenue growth, combined with constrained expense growth, contributed to our Established Community portfolio achieving year-over-year growth in net operating income ( NOI ) of 3.6% in 2008. However, due to the decline in market fundamentals during the fourth quarter of 2008, rental revenue from Established Communities increased 1.7% and NOI increased 2.4% over the prior year period. We expect a decrease in Earnings per share diluted ( EPS ) in 2009 from the prior year of approximately 50%, driven primarily by the decrease in expected dispositions for 2009. Contributing to these results will be an expected decline in the revenue and net operating income from our Established Communities in 2009. The recession, coupled with the short term nature of apartment leases, has adversely impacted current operating fundamentals. While certain apartment markets continue to exhibit positive trends, the negative impact on renter demand from net job losses is expected to result in year-over-year declines in NOI. We believe that the adverse impact of the recession will be somewhat offset by (i) the expected continued weakness in the for-sale housing market during 2009 and (ii) growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent. In addition, the level of new rental completions in the Company markets is anticipated to decline during 2009 from 2008 levels. Our current financial outlook for 2009 provides for a decline in rental revenue of between 1.5% and 3.5% in our Established Community portfolio and a projected NOI decline of 4.25% to 6.25%. While current capital market conditions continue to adversely affect access to liquidity, we were able to demonstrate the benefits of the financial flexibility that comes with a largely unencumbered capital structure. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we raised in excess of $1,900,000,000 of capital through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt, sales of assets, and joint venture partner capital commitments. During 2008 we sourced approximately $1,200,000,000 in debt at attractive prices from a variety of sources, including the Government Sponsored Enterprises, tax-exempt debt, money center banks and even a local bank for long term secured debt. In addition, we achieved a record level of dispositions during 2008, selling eleven communities (including one held by the Fund) for an aggregate gross sales price of $646,200,000. We anticipate our level of disposition activity to be in the range of gross sales of $100,000,000 to $200,000,000 in 2009. However, our actual disposition activity may differ significantly and will depend on various factors including market and economic conditions in 2009. We used the proceeds from both the debt financing activity and community dispositions to fund our development and redevelopment activities, reduce amounts drawn under our unsecured line of credit, repay secured and unsecured debt, prepay certain secured debt with higher interest costs and repurchase common stock. Capital needs result primarily from development expenditures, maturing debt and dividend requirements. Our committed capital is sufficient to complete the development underway and meet other liquidity uses. See the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources. While we believe that our development activity will continue to create long-term value, we reduced our expected level of development in response to the general deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions, the general 41 recessionary environment. As previously disclosed, we do not anticipate starting any new development during the first half of 2009. Development starts in the second half of 2009, if any, will be evaluated based on our assessment of economic and capital market conditions at that time. We do expect to increase redevelopment activity in 2009 for both wholly owned and Fund (as defined below) related assets. As a result of the reduction in our development activities, we incurred certain non-cash and other charges as discussed in the table above. During 2008 we completed 13 communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $1,044,300,000, while only starting six communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $491,000,000. During 2009, the Company expects to disburse approximately $650,000,000 related to the 14 communities under development at December 31, 2008 and expected acquisitions of land for future development. We expect approximately $100,000,000 of the projected 2009 disbursements will be funded from cash in escrow related to previously sourced tax-exempt debt. Our 2009 financial plan anticipates a continuation of poor credit markets and constrained liquidity. However, we believe that our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our current development and redevelopment activities. We expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt and/or common and preferred equity) and secured debt, as well as from disposition proceeds, joint ventures or from retained cash. We believe that the current market provides for an opportunity to perform certain deferred maintenance and repositioning activities at attractive costs due to the continued decline in costs for construction materials and labor. During 2009, we expect to start 16 redevelopments of wholly owned communities, as well as five redevelopments of communities on behalf of the Fund, as defined below. AvalonBay Value Added Fund, L.P. (the Fund ) is a discretionary investment fund with nine institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of the Fund and has invested approximately $48,000,000 in the Fund, representing a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. The Fund was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in March 2008. On September 2, 2008, we announced the formation of AvalonBay Value Added Fund II, L.P. ( Fund II ), a private, discretionary investment vehicle with commitments from four institutional investors including us totaling $333,000,000. We have committed $150,000,000 to Fund II, representing a 45% equity interest. At final closing, the aggregate investor commitments to Fund II and our commitment and percentage interest in Fund II may change. Fund II can employ leverage of up to 65%, allowing for a total investment capacity of approximately $950,000,000 and has a term of ten years plus two one-year extension options. Fund II will acquire and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in our current markets with the objective of creating value through redevelopment, enhanced operations and/or improving market fundamentals. Fund II will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investments in apartment communities for a period of three years from the closing date or until 90% of its committed capital is invested, subject to limited exceptions. Fund II will not include or involve our development activities. We will receive, in addition to any returns on its invested equity, asset management fees, property management fees and redevelopment fees. We will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met. As of December 31, 2008, there has been no capital contributed to Fund II and Fund II has made no investments. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Fund II entered into a $75,000,000 unsecured credit facility, with an option to increase the facility up to $200,000,000, subject to certain lender requirements. The credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum, and matures in December 2011, assuming the exercise of a one-year extension option. At December 31, 2008, there was $760,000 outstanding under the Fund II credit facility. Communities Overview Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development ( Development Communities ) and Development Rights (i.e., land or options to purchase land held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this report. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the 42 beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. NOI of our current operating communities, is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. As of December 31, 2008, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 178 apartment communities containing 50,292 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which 14 communities were under construction and nine communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 23 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including 19 owned by the Fund. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 27 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 7,304 apartment homes. 43 Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity.

Net income available to common stockholders increased $91,614,000 or 35.5% in 2007 over the prior year period due primarily to sales of consolidated operating communities and investments in unconsolidated entities and related gains combined with growth in NOI from Established Communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 to net income for each year, are as follows (dollars in thousands): 44 For the year ended 12-31-08 12-31-07 12-31-06 Net income $ 411,487 $ 358,160 $ 266,546 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 33,045 31,285 28,811 Investments and investment management 17,298 11,737 7,030 Interest expense, net 114,878 94,540 106,271 General and administrative expense 42,781 28,494 24,767 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (4,566 ) (59,169 ) (7,455 ) Minority interest in consolidated partnerships (741 ) 1,585 573 Depreciation expense 194,150 168,324 149,352 Impairment loss 57,899 Gain on sale of real estate assets (284,901 ) (107,032 ) (110,930 ) Income from discontinued operations (12,208 ) (20,489 ) (20,193 ) Net operating income $ 569,122 $ 507,435 $ 444,772 The NOI increases for both 2008 and 2007, as compared to the prior year period, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 Increase Increase Established Communities $ 14,257 $ 27,665 Other Stabilized Communities 14,982 10,186 Development and Redevelopment Communities 32,448 24,812 Total $ 61,687 $ 62,663 The NOI increases in Established Communities in 2008 were largely due to continued favorable but moderating apartment market fundamentals. During 2008, we continued to focus on rental rate growth, while maintaining occupancy of at least 95% in all regions. We anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will decline in 2009 such that overall rental revenue will decline between 1.5% and 3.5% as compared to the 3.1% growth achieved in 2008. The expected revenue decline is due to the general decline in overall economic conditions and related employment levels. Expense growth also impacts growth in NOI and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth. We expect operating expenses to increase between 3.0% and 4.0% in 2009 from prior year levels, attributable primarily to increases in property taxes, utilities, insurance and office operations. As a result, we expect NOI for our Established Communities to decline between 4.25% and 6.25%. These projections are based on our outlook for economic conditions in 2009, both nationally and in the markets where we operate. There can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions and/or their impact on our operating results will be accurate, and actual results could differ materially. Please see Risk Factors, Forward Looking Statements and other discussions in this report on Form 10-K for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations. Net operating income ( NOI ) is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. Rental and other income increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our Established Communities, coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes decreased to 37,886 apartment homes for 2008 as compared to 38,436 homes for 2007 and 37,716 homes for 2006. This change is primarily the result of communities sold during 2008 containing 3,459 apartment homes, as well as declining occupancy levels due to the economic slow down, partially offset by increased homes available from newly developed communities,. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $1,921 for 2008 as compared to $1,767 in 2007 and $1,610 in 2006. 45 Established Communities Rental revenue increased $18,221,000, or 3.1%, for 2008 and increased $34,257,000, or 5.5%, for 2007. These increases are due entirely to increased average rental rates. For 2008, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 3.1% to $1,928 compared to $1,870 in 2007, primarily due to increased market rents. There was no change in year-over-year average economic occupancy for 2008. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in Established Communities rental revenue in all six of our regions for 2008 as compared to the prior year period. The largest percentage increases in rental revenue were in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest regions, with increases of 5.9% and 5.2%, respectively, between years. Almost 70% of our Established Community revenue is generated by the Metro New York/New Jersey, Northern California and the New England regions, and are discussed in more detail below. The Metro New York/New Jersey region, which accounted for approximately 23.8% of Established Community rental revenue for 2008, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 2.3% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Average rental rates increased 2.4% to $2,353, and economic occupancy decreased 0.1% to 96.2% for 2008 as compared to 2007. During 2008 the trend of weakening rental market conditions in both New York City and surrounding suburban markets resulting from the recession is reflected in the declining occupancy levels in the second half of 2008. The challenges facing the financial services industry are expected to continue throughout 2009 resulting in a further decline in employment levels. We will remain focused on the current market conditions, as we seek to manage the resulting impact on our community operating results for 2009. Northern California, which represented approximately 21.1% of Established Community rental revenue during 2008, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 5.9% as compared to 2007. Average rental rates increased by 6.2% to $1,943 and economic occupancy declined by 0.3% from 97.0% to 96.7% for 2008 as compared to 2007. We expect Northern California to see a modest decline in revenue in 2009. The New England region accounted for approximately 21.0% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2008 and experienced rental revenue growth of 2.3% over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.2% to $2,053 and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 96.3% for 2008, as compared to 2007. Given the significance of the financial services industry in the Boston metro area, as well as the impact of New York trends on Fairfield-New Haven, we continue to monitor the recent decline in job growth as compared to 2007 due to the current volatility in the financial services industry. In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term, which is generally one year. As a supplemental measure, we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. Rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions, as well as current rental market conditions. The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2006 is not presented, as Established Community classification is not comparable prior to January 1, 2007. See Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 For the year ended 12-31-08 12-31-07 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 605,657 $ 587,436 Concessions amortized 5,973 5,316 Concessions granted (7,271 ) (5,469 ) Rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis $ 604,359 $ 587,283 Year-over-year % change GAAP revenue 3.1 % n/a Year-over-year % change cash concession based revenue 2.9 % n/a Management, development and other fees increased $426,000, or 6.9% in 2008 and decreased $117,000, or 1.9% in 2007. The increase in 2008 was due primarily to increased redevelopment fees and property management fees as additional communities were acquired by the Fund. The decrease in 2007 was due primarily to lower development and redevelopment management fees coupled with the disposition of our interest in a joint venture, partially offset by increased management fees from Fund communities. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $19,666,000, or 10.8% in 2008 and increased $16,472,000, or 10.0% for 2007 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $521,000, or 0.4% to $133,459,000 for 2008 and $1,661,000, or 1.1% to $148,628,000 for 2007, due primarily to increased utilities, administrative and community maintenance related costs, offset partially by a decrease in insurance and payroll related expenses. The increases in administrative expense are primarily due to increases in bad debt, due to a general decline in the economic climate. Property taxes increased $6,705,000, or 9.5% and $7,911,000, or 12.6% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments. Property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals. For Established Communities, property taxes increased by $3,107,000, or 5.6% and $2,618,000, or 4.5% for 2008 and 2007, respectively due to both higher assessments throughout all regions and reductions in property taxes realized in 2007 that did not occur in 2008. The impact of the current economic environment has not been reflected in current assessments, as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments. We expect property taxes in 2009 to increase over 2008 due primarily to higher tax rates, without the benefit of lower assessed values. Property tax increases are limited by law (Proposition 13) for communities in California. We evaluate property tax increases internally, as well as engage third-party consultants, and appeal increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by $1,247,000, or 3.2% in 2008 and $4,450,000, or 13.0% in 2007 over the prior year periods. These increases are due primarily to increased compensation and employee separation costs, as well as costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities. The 2008 expense includes transition and ongoing costs related to our Customer Care Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia that we opened in the third quarter of 2007 to centralize certain community-related accounting, administrative and customer service functions. Investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions, investment management and abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of development pursuits, acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits. Investments and investment management costs increased in 2008 and 2007 compared to the prior year periods due primarily to increases in abandoned pursuit costs. Abandoned pursuit costs were $12,511,000 in 2008, $6,974,000 in 2007 and $2,115,000 in 2006. The increase in abandoned pursuit costs in 2008 is due to the reduction in our planned development activity. These costs can be volatile, 47 particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future periods. Interest expense, net increased $20,338,000, or 21.5% and decreased $11,731,000, or 11.0% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. This category includes both interest expense and interest income. The increase in 2008 is due primarily to a decrease in interest income in 2008 as compared to the prior year period, coupled with increased interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007. The higher level of interest income in 2007 is due to higher invested cash balances from our January 2007 equity offering. The increased interest expense in 2008 is due primarily to increased amounts of debt outstanding in 2008 compared to the prior year period. In addition, interest expense in 2008 was reduced by including the gain of $1,950,000 recognized by repurchasing $15,000,000 of our $250,000,000, 5.5% unsecured notes at a discount of 87% of par for $13,050,000. Interest expense also includes charges of approximately $410,000 related to unamortized deferred financing costs and purchase premiums for debt that was repaid prior to its scheduled maturity. Depreciation expens e increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) increased $14,287,000, or 50.1% in 2008 and increased $3,727,000, or 15.0% in 2007 as compared to the prior year periods. The 2008 increase is due primarily to compensation, including severance and related costs associated with the decrease in our planned development activity, federal excise tax expense resulting from gains on our increased disposition activity during 2008 and organization costs for the formation of Fund II. The 2007 increase is primarily due to increased compensation costs. Impairment loss for 2008 is due primarily to the write down of eight land parcels which we have decided to not develop. We did not recognize an impairment loss in either 2007 or 2006. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities for 2008 decreased from the prior year period due primarily to the gain on the sale of two partnership interests in 2007 and the related loss of partnership income, partially offset by our portion of the gain from the sale of a community by a joint venture partner, income from joint ventures where the underlying communities have achieved stabilized operations and gains from our investment in a joint venture formed to develop for-sale homes. The increase in 2007 over the prior year period is due primarily to approximately $60,000,000 in gains from the dispositions of two investments in 2007. Minority interest in consolidated partnerships for 2008 resulted in income of $741,000, compared to expense of $1,585,000 in 2007 due to recognition of income for our joint venture partners portion of the net loss incurred by Fund II, as well as the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2007 and 2008, thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests. The increase in 2007 over the prior year period is due primarily to the recognition in 2007 of the sale of a 70% joint venture partner interest in one of our unconsolidated communities, partially offset by the redemption of limited partnership units, as discussed above. Gain on sale of land for 2008 decreased from the prior year period due to the absence of land sales in 2008. Gain on sale of land from 2007 decreased from 2006 due to the volume and size of parcels sold each year. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. This income decreased for 2008 and 2007 due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period. See Note 7, Real Estate Disposition Activities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on sale of communities increased in 2008 and 2007 as compared to the prior year periods as a result of a higher volume of sales in each respective year. The amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. 48 Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders ( FFO ) FFO is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere this report. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Selected Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions), as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; debt service and maturity payments; normal recurring operating expenses; DownREIT partnership unit distributions; and capital calls for the Fund and Fund II, as required. The capital and credit markets contracted significantly during 2008, resulting in a constrained liquidity environment. Although general market liquidity was constrained, we were able to satisfy our liquidity needs from a combination of cash flows provided by secured and unsecured financings, proceeds from asset sales and cash from operations. In 2009, we continue to expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility (as defined below), secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below, as well as our operating activities. To the extent that currently available internal and external resources do not satisfy our needs, we may seek additional external financing. Additional external financing could come from a variety of sources, such as public sales of debt or equity securities or unsecured or secured loans from financial institutions or other private or governmental lenders, among others. Private equity through joint ventures may also be used. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. At December 31, 2008, we have unrestricted cash and cash in escrow of $259,305,000 available for development activities. For the year ended December 31, 2008 we raised in excess of $1,900,000,000 of capital through the issuance of secured debt and unsecured debt, equity commitments from private equity sources and sales of assets. We used these proceeds to fund our development and redevelopment activities, reduce amounts drawn under our unsecured line of credit, repay secured and unsecured debt, prepay certain unsecured debt with interest costs above prevailing rates and repurchase our common and preferred stock. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $65,706,000 at December 31, 2008, an increase of $45,435,000 from $20,271,000 at December 31, 2007. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing 49 and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $386,855,000 in 2008 from $454,874,000 in 2007. The decrease was driven primarily by the payment of interest amounts and the timing of general corporate payables, partially offset by the additional NOI from our Established Communities, as well as NOI from recently developed communities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $266,309,000 in 2008 related to investments in assets through the development and redevelopment of apartment communities, partially offset by the gross proceeds from the disposition of communities in the amount of $529,777,000 and an increase in construction escrows of $126,611,000. During 2008, we invested $902,327,000 in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures: We acquired six parcels of land in connection with Development Rights, for a purchase price of approximately $97,174,000 . We had capital expenditures of $20,824,000 for real estate and non-real estate assets. We invested approximately $881,503,000 in the development of communities, including the commencement of the development of six communities which are expected to contain an aggregate of 1,768 apartment homes for an expected aggregate total capitalized cost of $491,000,000. Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities totaled $75,111,000 in 2008. The net cash used is due primarily to the payment of cash dividends in the amount of $278,795,000, the redemption of preferred stock for $100,000,000 and the repurchase of 482,100 shares of our common stock at an average price of $87.42 per share, offset somewhat by the net issuance of secured and unsecured debt of $350,054,000, including amounts repaid under our Credit Facility (as defined below). In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $200,000,000 in our common stock repurchase program, increasing the total amount the Company can acquire to $500,000,000, of which approximately $300,000,000 has been used to repurchase our common stock as of December 31, 2008. The decision to use the additional share repurchase authorization will depend on current capital market conditions and liquidity, our share price relative to the net asset value per share and other uses of capital, including development. In October 2008, we exercised our option to redeem all 4,000,000 outstanding shares of our 8.70% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100,701,000. The repayment amount includes the redemption value of the outstanding shares of $25 per share and accrued but unpaid dividends through the redemption date. We recorded a non-cash charge for deferred offering expenses of approximately $3,566,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to this redemption. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We currently have a $1,000,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility ) with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in November 2011 (assuming our exercise of a one-year renewal option). In the aggregate, we pay an annual facility fee of approximately $1,250,000. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.40% per annum (0.85% on January 31, 2009). The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.325% to LIBOR plus 1.00% based on our credit rating. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $422,500,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the Credit Facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at January 31, 2009. At January 31, 2009, $335,000,000 was outstanding on the Credit Facility, $45,415,000 was used to provide letters of credit, and $619,585,000 was available for borrowing under the Credit Facility. We are subject to certain customary financial and other covenants under the Credit Facility, our $330,000,000 variable rate, unsecured term loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The financial covenants include the following: limitation on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure, limitation on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing, and minimum levels of debt service coverage. We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2008. 50 Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid substantially prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our Credit Facility or by equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following financing activity occurred during 2008: we repaid $50,000,000, 6.625% principal amount of previously issued unsecured notes, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity; we redeemed $10,000,000 principal amount of our $150,000,000, 7.5% unsecured notes that mature in August 2009 for $10,287,500 with the premium above par recorded as a charge to earnings; we repaid $146,000,000 of unsecured notes with an annual interest rate of 8.25% pursuant to their scheduled maturity; we redeemed $15,000,000 principal amount of our $250,000,000, 5.5% unsecured notes that mature in January 2012 at a discount price of 87% of par; we repaid the loans secured by Avalon Knoll, which is located in Germantown, Maryland and had a fixed rate of 6.95%, Avalon Landing, which is located in Annapolis, Maryland and had a fixed rate of 6.85%, and Avalon at Fairway Hills, which is located in Columbia, Maryland and had a variable rate. These loans, which had contractual maturities of 2026 and an aggregate amount outstanding of $28,707,000, were repaid early at par; we repaid the $4,368,000, 6.99% fixed rate loan secured by a development right in Wheaton, Maryland pursuant to its scheduled maturity; we borrowed $170,125,000 under an interest-only mortgage note secured by Avalon at Arlington Square, located in Arlington, Virginia at an effective rate of 4.69% for five years; we borrowed $94,572,000 under an interest-only mortgage note secured by Avalon at Cameron Court, located in Alexandria, Virginia at an effective rate of 4.95% for five years; we borrowed $110,600,000 under an interest-only mortgage note secured by Avalon Crescent, located in McLean, Virginia at an effective rate of 5.48% for seven years; we borrowed $150,000,000 under an interest-only mortgage note secured by Avalon Silicon Valley, located in Sunnyvale, California at an effective rate of 5.66% for seven years; we entered into a $330,000,000, variable rate unsecured term loan comprised of three tranches bearing interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25%, of which approximately one third matures in each of the next three years beginning in 2009; we closed both a variable rate bond financing relating to Avalon Walnut Creek in the aggregate amount of $135,000,000, of which $126,000,000 is tax-exempt, as well as an associated 4.0% fixed-rate construction loan of $2,500,000; we closed a $62,400,000, 6.02% fixed rate loan secured by Avalon at Greyrock Place, located in Stamford, Connecticut; we closed a $51,749,000, 6.12% fixed rate loan secured by Avalon Darien, located in Darien, Connecticut; we closed a $55,100,000, 5.875% fixed rate loan secured by Avalon Commons, located in Smithtown, New York; we repaid $390,500,000 outstanding under our Credit Facility; we repurchased 482,100 shares of our common stock at an average price of $87.42 per share, for a total approximate purchase price of $42,144,000; we redeemed 44,592 limited partnership units in certain DownREITs for $1,756,000; and 51 we exercised our option to redeem all 4,000,000 outstanding shares of our 8.70% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100,701,000, inclusive of accrued but unpaid dividends through the redemption date. In January 2009, we made a cash tender offer for any and all of our 7.5% unsecured notes due August 2009 and December 2010. We purchased $37,438,000 of our $150,000,000, 7.5% unsecured notes due August 2009 at par. In addition, we purchased $64,423,000 of our $200,000,000, 7.5% unsecured notes due December 2010 at a discount price of 98% of par, for approximately $63,135,000, representing a yield to maturity of 8.66%. A gain of approximately $1,062,000 will be recorded in the first quarter of 2009 in conjunction with the purchase of the unsecured notes due December 2010. All of the notes purchased in the tender offer were cancelled. We previously acquired and cancelled an aggregate of $10,000,000 of the 7.5% unsecured notes due in August 2009. The following table details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands). 52 All-In Principal interest maturity Balance outstanding Scheduled maturities Community rate (1) date 12-31-07 12-31-08 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Tax-exempt bonds Fixed rate CountryBrook 6.30 % Mar-2012 $ 15,356 $ 14,680 $ 719 $ 766 $ 816 $ 12,379 $ $ Avalon at Symphony Glen 4.90 % Jul-2024 9,780 9,780 9,780 Avalon at Lexington 6.55 % Feb-2025 12,078 11,665 439 466 495 526 559 9,180 Avalon Campbell 6.48 % Jun-2025 31,877 30,914 (2) 30,914 Avalon Pacifica 6.48 % Jun-2025 14,460 14,023 (2) 14,023 Avalon Knoll 6.95 % Jun-2026 11,654 Avalon Fields 7.55 % May-2027 10,224 9,988 275 295 316 339 364 8,399 Avalon Oaks 7.45 % Jul-2041 17,077 16,940 147 157 168 180 193 16,095 Avalon Oaks West 7.48 % Apr-2043 16,919 16,795 133 142 152 162 173 16,033 Avalon at Chestnut Hill 5.82 % Oct-2047 42,149 41,834 331 349 368 388 409 39,989 181,574 166,619 2,044 2,175 2,315 13,974 1,698 144,413 Variable rate (3) The Promenade 2.55 % Oct-2010 30,844 30,142 754 29,388 Waterford 1.52 % Jul-2014 33,100 33,100 (4) 33,100 Avalon at Mountain View 1.42 % Feb-2017 18,300 18,300 (4) 18,300 Avalon at Mission Viejo 1.59 % Jun-2025 7,635 7,635 (4) 7,635 Avalon at Nob Hill 5.20 % Jun-2025 20,800 20,800 (4) 20,800 Avalon Campbell 0.87 % Jun-2025 6,923 7,886 (2) 7,886 Avalon Pacifica 0.87 % Jun-2025 3,140 3,577 (2) 3,577 Avalon at Fairway Hills I 0.00 % Jun-2026 11,500 Avalon Bowery Place I 2.12 % Nov-2037 93,800 93,800 (5) 93,800 Avalon Bowery Place II 2.07 % Nov-2039 48,500 48,500 (5) 48,500 Avalon Acton 1.77 % Jul-2040 45,000 45,000 (5) 45,000 Avalon Morningside Park 1.65 % Nov-2040 100,000 100,000 (5) 100,000 Avalon Walnut Creek 3.38 % Mar-2046 116,000 (5) 116,000 Avalon Walnut Creek 3.14 % Mar-2046 10,000 (5) 10,000 419,542 534,740 754 29,388 504,598 Conventional loans (6) Fixed rate $50 million unsecured notes 6.63 % Jan-2008 50,000 $150 million unsecured notes 8.38 % Jul-2008 146,000 $150 million unsecured notes 7.63 % Aug-2009 150,000 140,000 (7) 140,000 $200 million unsecured notes 7.66 % Dec-2010 200,000 200,000 (8) 200,000 $300 million unsecured notes 6.79 % Sep-2011 300,000 300,000 300,000 $50 million unsecured notes 6.31 % Sep-2011 50,000 50,000 50,000 $250 million unsecured notes 5.73 % Jan-2012 250,000 235,000 (9) 235,000 $250 million unsecured notes 6.26 % Nov-2012 250,000 250,000 250,000 $100 million unsecured notes 5.11 % Mar-2013 100,000 100,000 100,000 $150 million unsecured notes 5.52 % Apr-2014 150,000 150,000 150,000 $250 million unsecured notes 5.89 % Sep-2016 250,000 250,000 250,000 Wheaton Development Right 6.99 % Oct-2008 4,432 4600 Eisenhower Avenue 8.08 % Apr-2009 4,293 4,175 4,175 Avalon at Twinbrook 7.25 % Oct-2011 8,007 7,801 223 239 7,339 Avalon at Tysons West 5.55 % Jul-2028 6,381 6,218 173 183 193 204 216 5,249 Avalon Orchards 7.65 % Jul-2033 19,612 19,322 311 333 357 382 409 17,530 Avalon at Arlington Square 4.69 % Apr-2013 170,125 170,125 Avalon at Cameron Court 4.95 % Apr-2013 94,572 94,572 Avalon Crescent 5.48 % May-2015 110,600 110,600 Avalon Silicon Valley 5.66 % Jul-2015 150,000 150,000 Avalon Darien 6.12 % Nov-2015 51,749 51,749 Avalon Greyrock Place 6.02 % Nov-2015 62,400 62,400 Avalon Commons 5.88 % Dec-2013 55,100 55,100 Avalon Walnut Creek 4.00 % Jul-2066 2,500 2,500 1,938,725 2,409,562 144,882 200,755 357,889 485,586 420,422 800,028 Variable rate (3) Avalon at Flanders Hill 4.06 % May-2009 20,510 19,735 (4) 19,735 Avalon at Newton Highlands 4.18 % Dec-2009 36,335 34,945 (4) 34,945 Avalon at Crane Brook 5.09 % Mar-2011 32,560 31,530 (4) 1,106 1,169 29,255 Avalon at Bedford Center 4.10 % May-2012 16,816 16,361 (4) 497 527 560 14,777 Avalon Walnut Creek 3.59 % Mar-2046 9,000 (5) 9,000 $105.6 million unsecured notes 2.96 % May-2009 105,600 105,600 $112.2 million unsecured notes 2.96 % Jan-2010 112,200 112,200 $112.2 million unsecured notes 2.96 % Jan-2011 112,200 112,200 106,221 441,571 161,883 113,896 142,015 14,777 9,000 Total indebtedness excluding unsecured credit facility $ 2,646,062 $3,552,492 $ 309,563 $ 346,214 $ 502,219 $ 514,337 $ 422,120 $ 1,458,039 (1) Includes credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees fees and other fees.

(5) Represents full amount of the debt as of December 31, 2008. Actual amounts drawn on the debt as of December 31, 2008 are $93,279 for Bowery Place I, $44,678 for Bowery Place II, $44,148 for Avalon Acton, $78,505 for Morningside Park, and $0 for Walnut Creek. (6) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and are not net of $2,035 of debt discount as of December 31, 2008 and $2,501 of debt discount as of December 31, 2007, as reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. 53 (7) In April 2008, we redeemed $10,000 aggregate principal amount of our $150,000, 7.5% unsecured notes due in August 2009. In January 2009, we redeemed $37,438 principal amount of our $150,000, 7.5% unsecured notes due August 2009.

(9) In November 2008, we redeemed $15,000 aggregate principal amount of our $250,000, 5.5% unsecured notes due January 2012. Future Financing and Capital Needs Dividend Requirements As a REIT, we are subject to certain dividend distribution requirements in relation to taxable income to avoid paying federal income and federal excise taxes at the corporate level. During 2008, we sold 11 communities including one community sold by the Fund. Absent a special distribution in excess of our normal, recurring quarterly dividend, we would have had taxable income in excess of distributions resulting in federal income tax at the corporate level. To qualify for the dividends paid deduction for tax purposes and minimize this potential tax, in December 2008 we declared a combined special and regular dividend (the Combined Dividend ) of $2.70 per share, comprised of a special dividend of $1.8075 (the Special Dividend ) per share and our regular dividend of $0.8925 per share. The Company recorded a charge of $3,200,000 related to the expected federal excise taxes related to the gains on sale recognized during 2008. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2008, we had 14 new communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $666,623,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had nine communities which we own, or in which we have a direct or indirect interest, under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $53,214,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, will be funded from: cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles; the remaining capacity under our $1,000,000,000 Credit Facility; retained operating cash; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding, including joint venture activity. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the Fund or Fund II as discussed below, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write-off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. On September 2, 2008, we announced the formation of Fund II, a private, discretionary investment vehicle with commitments from us and four institutional investors. Fund II has equity commitments totaling $333,000,000. We have committed $150,000,000 to the Fund, representing a 45% equity interest. Fund II will acquire and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in our current markets with the objective of creating value through redevelopment, enhanced operations and/or improving market fundamentals. Fund II will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investments in apartment communities until 2011, or earlier when 90% of its committed capital is invested, subject to limited exceptions. Fund II will not include or involve our development activities. We will receive, in addition to any returns on our invested equity, asset management fees, property 54 management fees and redevelopment fees. We will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met. As of January 31, 2009, there have been no capital contributions to Fund II, and Fund II has not made any investments. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Fund II entered into a $75,000,000 unsecured credit facility, with an option to increase the facility up to $200,000,000, subject to certain lender requirements. The credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum, and matures in December 2011, assuming the exercise of a one-year extension option. At December 31, 2008, there was $760,000 outstanding under the Fund II credit facility. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, Investments in Real Estate Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. CVP I, LLC has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturing in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We have agreed to guarantee, under limited circumstances, the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of CVP I, LLC repayment obligations under the bonds . We have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that CVP I, LLC will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project (Chrystie Place in New York City) overall once tenant improvements related to a retail tenant are complete, which is expected in 2009. Our 80% partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under these guarantees, both at inception and as of December 31, 2008 were not significant. As a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at December 31, 2008. The Fund has 22 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $436,698,000. These mortgage loans have varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid), ranging from October 2011 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. The Fund has two credit facilities that mature in December 2008. The Fund had $3,000,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2008 under its credit facilities. The mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the Fund with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate, and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments. We have not guaranteed the debt of the Fund, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the Fund be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of the Fund, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of the Fund, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the Fund (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the 55 partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $7,192,000 as of December 31, 2008). As of December 31, 2008, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by the Fund is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2008 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2008. MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $105,000,000. The loan is a fixed-rate, interest-only note bearing interest at 6.02%, maturing in December 2015. We have not guaranteed the debt of MVP I, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should MVP I, LLC be unable to do so. Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $40,763,000. The variable-rate loan had an interest rate of 3.40% at December 31, 2008. We have not guaranteed the debt of Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC be unable to do so. Aria at Hathorne Hill, LLC is a joint venture in which we have a non-managing member interest. The LLC is developing 64 for-sale town homes in Danvers, Massachusetts. The LLC has two separate variable rate loans with aggregate borrowings of $4,476,000 and an interest rate of 2.875% at December 31, 2008. In addition, Aria at Hathorne has a short-term variable rate note for approximately $263,000 at an interest rate of 3.7% due in 2009. We have not guaranteed the debt of Aria at Hathorne, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Aria at Hathorne be unable to do so. PHVP I, LLC, a consolidated joint venture in which we hold a 99.0% controlling interest, is constructing a public garage adjacent to our Walnut Creek development. As part of the construction management services we provide to PHVP I, LLC for the construction of the public garage, we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing. Our obligations under this guarantee terminate upon (i) the issuance of a certificate of substantial completion and (ii) completion of a list of lender requirements. The certificate of substantial completion was issued on July 11, 2008 and the completion of the lender requirements list is nearing completion. We expect termination of the guarantee in the first half of 2009. In 2007 we entered into a non-cancelable commitment (the Commitment ) to acquire parcels of land in Brooklyn, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111,000,000. Under the terms of the Commitment, we will close on the various parcels over a period determined by the seller ability to execute unrelated purchase transactions and achieve deferral of gains for the land sold under this Commitment. However, under no circumstances will the Commitment extend beyond 2011, at which time either we or the seller can compel execution of the remaining transactions. At December 31, 2008, we have an outstanding commitment to purchase the remaining land for approximately $62,519,000. There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. Contractual Obligations We currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long-term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space. During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into an operating land lease agreement relating to our Avalon Walnut Creek community currently under development. Aside from this lease, there have not been any other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2008. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): 56 Payments due by period Less than 1 More than 5 Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Debt Obligations (1) $ 3,676,492 $ 433,563 $ 848,433 $ 936,457 $ 1,458,039 Operating Lease Obligations (2) 2,316,449 16,262 32,777 32,914 2,234,496 Total $ 5,992,941 $ 449,825 $ 881,210 $ 969,371 $ 3,692,535 (1) Includes $124,000 outstanding under our variable rate Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008. The table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in 2009 See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Amounts exclude interest payable as of December 31, 2008. (2) Includes land leases expiring between November 2028 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, Metro NY/NJ and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including the recent economic downturn; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should not rely on 57 forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., Risk Factors, in this document for a discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of the Fund, Fund II or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective Fund; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the guidance of FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (as revised) and 58 Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we look to the guidance in AICPA Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, and Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments, to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of these rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2008, our assets would have increased by $953,524,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $723,395,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities under FIN 46(R), the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct and those indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment, and as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2008 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our operating expenses would have increased by $3,034,000. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of 59 Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the acquisition or development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If it were determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuits were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have decreased by $5,737,000. Asset Impairment Evaluation We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS 144 ) for our consolidated operating apartment communities, Development Communities and Development Rights to determine the need for performing impairment analyses, as well as to measure the loss if an impairment has occurred on a regular basis, considering qualitative economic factors . We also apply the provisions of SFAS 144 for assessing the need to perform an impairment analysis and measuring impairment losses on the underlying long-lived assets held by our unconsolidated joint venture investments. In addition, we apply the provisions of APB No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock ( APB 18 ), to determine if there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures. Because each asset is unique, requiring significant management judgment, we believe that the asset impairment evaluation under SFAS 144, and the assessment of other than temporary declines in fair value under APB 18, are critical accounting estimates. For both analyses, management judgment is required both to determine if a significant event has occurred, such that an impairment analysis is necessary, as well as for the assessment and measurement of any potential impairment. Under APB 18, in the event that there has been a loss in value for an investment, a loss is only recognized if it is other than temporary which requires management judgment. To perform the SFAS 144 impairment analysis, we must estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset, which in the case of an apartment community would be the cash flows from operations and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset. Forecasting cash flows requires assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period, rental rates, occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period, as well as disposition proceeds. In addition, when an impairment has occurred, we must estimate the discount factor, or market capitalization rate, to apply to the undiscounted cash flows to derive the fair value of the position. The market capitalization rate is influenced by many factors, including national and local economic conditions, as well as the location and quality of the asset. Our analysis of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under APB 18 considers our ability to recover the carrying amount of our investment by evaluating the current fair value of the net assets underlying the investment using our estimate of the forecasted cash flows that the asset will generate, including any incremental cash flows from investment management or other fees related to the investment, disposition proceeds and an estimated market capitalization rate. Our estimate of the fees considers various factors, including any contractually guaranteed amounts and expected periods over which the fees will be earned. In the event that the current fair value of our investment, considering the above factors, is less than our current carrying basis, an impairment exists. We must then determine if the impairment is other than temporary. Whether an impairment is other than temporary is a subjective determination, primarily considering the ability of the joint venture entity to generate cash flows from operations, the expected proceeds from the disposition of our position, and whether our expected investment horizon is adequate to recover any unrealized loss in the fair value of our investment. Changes in the future cash flows associated with an asset have a direct, linear relationship to the fair value of the position. For example, holding all other variables constant, if there is a 10% decline in the estimated cash flows from operations for a community, there would be a corresponding decrease in the fair value of that asset of 10%. Changes in the market capitalization rate have an inverse relationship with the fair value of an asset, with a decrease in the market capitalization rate resulting in an increase in the fair value of the asset. For example, an asset that is valued at $80,000,000 when using a five percent market capitalization rate will increase in value to $100,000,000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by one 60 percent to four percent, and to $133,000,000 if the market capitalization rate decreases by two percent, to a three percent market capitalization rate. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized an impairment loss of $57,899,000 associated with certain land parcels which we no longer intend to develop. At December 31, 2008 we determined that none of our consolidated operating communities, Development Communities, or investments in unconsolidated joint ventures were impaired under the provisions of SFAS 144, or APB 18, as appropriate. These conclusions were based on the factors that existed as of December 31, 2008. Given the recent deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions, we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1a., Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ( the Code ), as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2008, our net income would have decreased by approximately $210,500,000. Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.
