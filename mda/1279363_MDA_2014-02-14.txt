Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated) The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2013 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2013 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Introduction We are a leading managed care company for government-sponsored health care coverage with a focus on Medicaid and Medicare programs. Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, we offer a variety of managed care health plans for families, children, and the aged, blind and disabled, as well as prescription drug plans. As of December 31, 2013 , we served approximately 2.8 million members in 49 states and the District of Columbia. We believe that our broad range of experience and exclusive government focus allows us to effectively serve our members, partner with our providers and government clients, and efficiently manage our ongoing operations. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Summarized below are the key financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2013. For additional information, refer to the "Results of Operations" section which discusses both consolidated and segment results in more detail. Membership increased 7% compared to December 31, 2012 due to growth in our Medicaid segment, mainly attributable to growth in Kentucky and Florida and our acquisitions in South Carolina and Missouri in January 2013 and March 2013, respectively. Additionally, membership in our Medicare Advantage ("MA") segment increased 36% , driven by service area expansion, product design and marketing activities within this segment. These increases were partially offset by lower prescription drug plan ("PDP") membership based on our 2013 bid results. Premiums increased 28% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of both acquisitions and organic membership growth in our Medicaid and MA segments, as well as rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, mainly Kentucky, partially offset by the impact of lower PDP membership. Net Income decreased 5% compared to the same period in 2012 mainly due to the impact of lower net favorable development in prior year medical benefits payable, lower results in our PDP segment and increased interest expense and other costs resulting from higher average debt levels in 2013 associated with additional borrowings, partially offset by the impact of increased premium revenue in our Medicaid and MA segments. Key Developments and Accomplishments Our current business priorities include improving health care quality and access for our members, optimizing financial performance, delivering prudent and profitable growth and achieving service excellence. See Part I, Item 1 Business for further discussion of our business priorities. Presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our business priorities that occurred or impacted our financial condition and results of operations during 2013 , or occurred in 2014 prior to the filing of this 2013 Form 10-K. In February 2014, we executed a contract with the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ("AHCA") to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in eight of the state eleven regions as part of the state Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) program. These regions include the Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee and Tampa metropolitan areas. As a result of these awards, we anticipate that our Florida Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ("TANF") and SSI membership will increase in 2014 to at least 500,000 from the 394,000 members that we served in December 2013. 52 Table of Contents In January 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Windsor Health Group, Inc. ("Windsor") from Munich Health North America, Inc., a part of Munich Re Group. Through its subsidiaries, Windsor serves Medicare beneficiaries with MA, PDP and Medicare Supplement products. As of January 2014, Windsor offered MA plans in 192 counties in the states of Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee. In addition, one of Windsor subsidiaries offers Medicare Supplement insurance policies through which it serves approximately 40,000 members in 39 states. Windsor also offers PDPs in 11 of the 34 CMS regions. As a result, in 2014 we are offering MA plans in a total of 402 counties in 18 states. In January 2014, we executed a contract with the Hawaii Department of Human Services for our 'Ohana plan to continue serving the state through the new QUEST Integration program. Ohana will cover Medicaid and other eligible individuals across Hawaii. Implementation of the QUEST Integration program is anticipated for January 1, 2015. Under Hawaii's Community Care Services Program, which began on a statewide basis in March 2013, we case manage, authorize and facilitate the delivery of behavioral health services to Medicaid-eligible adults who have serious mental illnesses and who are participants in the state's QUEST Expanded Access (QExA) health program. In November 2013, we completed the offering and sale of $600.0 million 5.75% unsecured senior notes due 2020 (the "Senior Notes"), and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the $336.5 million principal amount outstanding under the senior secured credit facility dated August 1, 2011, as amended to date (the "2011 Credit Agreement"). The remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were be used for general corporate purposes, including organic growth opportunities and potential acquisitions. See Note 12 - Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In November 2013, we were approved by the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (SCDHHS) to offer Medicaid in six additional counties in the state, effective January 1, 2014. With this approval, we provide Medicaid services in 45 out of 46 counties in South Carolina. Also, membership from Carolina Medical Homes ( CMH ) transitioned to us on January 1, 2014 as a result of changes SCDHHS made to its Healthy Connections Choices Medicaid managed care program and WellCare's purchase of certain assets from CMH. In September 2013, we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of Healthfirst Health Plan of New Jersey, Inc. ("Healthfirst NJ"). As of December 2013, Healthfirst NJ serves approximately 47,000 Medicaid members in 12 counties in the state. The acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of 2014, subject to customary regulatory approvals. Upon closure of the transaction, Healthfirst NJ member and physician rosters will be acquired by us and Healthfirst NJ will wind down operations. In addition, we began offering Medicaid managed care in Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Passaic and Union counties in New Jersey beginning January 1, 2014. For the 2014 plan year, we have expanded the geographic footprint of our MA plans to offer plans in a total of 210 counties in 14 states, excluding Windsor, but including dual special needs plans ( D-SNPs ) for those who are dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid in most of the MA markets we serve. This expansion is consistent with our focus on the lower-income demographic of the market and our ability over time to provide both the Medicaid- and Medicare-related coverage of these members. Effective July 5, 2013, Centene Corporation ("Centene") terminated its Medicaid contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky ("the Commonwealth") and is no longer serving members. Consequently, on July 6, 2013, the Commonwealth transferred approximately 57,000 members to us as part of its transition process. We began serving the members as of that date. Effective January 1, 2013, we received a premium rate increase of approximately 7.0% for the Kentucky Medicaid program. The Commonwealth also accelerated to July 1, 2013 our 3.0% rate increase previously scheduled for October 1, 2013. These rate increases apply to all Medicaid geographic regions of the Commonwealth, other than Region 3. We believe that these activities will make our Kentucky Medicaid program more stable from a financial standpoint. Also, effective January 1, 2013, we began serving Medicaid beneficiaries in the Commonwealth's Medicaid Managed Care Region 3. In March 2013, we acquired Missouri Care, Incorporated ("Missouri Care"), from Aetna, Inc. As of December 31, 2013, Missouri Care served more than 104,000 Missouri HealthNet Medicaid program members in 54 counties across the state. Missouri Care has an extensive provider network that includes more than 50 hospitals and 9,500 physicians. In January 2013, we acquired UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's Medicaid business in South Carolina. As of December 31, 2013, WellCare of South Carolina, Inc., formerly known as UnitedHealthcare of South Carolina, Inc., 53 Table of Contents ("WCSC") served approximately 50,000 Medicaid members in 39 of the state 46 counties, including the Columbia and Greenville metropolitan areas, through the South Carolina Healthy Connections Choices program. It has a network that includes more than 30 hospitals, 1,800 primary care physicians, and 2,000 specialists. General Economic and Political Environment and Health Care Reform Please refer to Part I, Item 1 Business, General Economic and Political Environment Impacting our Business and Health Care Reform for a further discussion of the current economic and political environment that is affecting our business, including discussion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the "Affordable Care Act") and its potential impact on our business. The Affordable Care Act will impose certain new taxes and fees, including limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible, as well as an annual premium-based health insurance industry assessment (the "industry fee") on health insurers beginning in 2014. The total industry fee levied on the health insurance industry will be $8 billion in 2014, with increasing annual amounts thereafter and growing to $14.3 billion by 2018. After 2018, the industry fee increases according to an index based on net premium growth. The assessment will be levied on certain health insurers that provide insurance in the assessment year, and will be allocated to health insurers based on each health insurer's share of net premiums for all U.S health insurers in the year preceding the assessment. The industry fee will not be deductible for income tax purposes, which will significantly increase our effective income tax rate. We currently estimate that we will incur between approximately $125 to $135 million in such fees in 2014, based on our estimated share of total 2013 industry premiums. However, the final fee amount will not be determined until August 2014. We currently expect to be reimbursed by our state customers for the impact of the fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. However, the timing of revenue recognition for such reimbursement may be delayed and not match the expense recognition of the fee, depending on the timing of contractual agreements. MA and PDP premiums will not be adjusted to offset the impact of the fee. In addition, refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows . RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results The following table sets forth condensed data from our consolidated statements of operations data, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussions for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. 54 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Revenues: (Dollars in millions) Premium $ 9,509.1 $ 7,400.2 $ 6,098.1 Investment and other income 18.8 8.8 8.7 Total revenues 9,527.9 7,409.0 6,106.8 Expenses: Medical benefits 8,258.6 6,303.9 4,948.0 Selling, general and administrative 856.5 690.8 642.1 Medicaid premium taxes 75.7 82.2 76.2 Depreciation and amortization 44.1 31.6 26.4 Interest 11.9 4.1 6.5 Total expenses 9,246.8 7,112.6 5,699.2 Income from operations 281.1 296.4 407.6 (Loss) gain on extinguishments of debt (2.8 ) 10.8 Income before income taxes 278.3 296.4 418.4 Income tax expense 103.0 111.7 154.2 Net income $ 175.3 $ 184.7 $ 264.2 Membership by Segment Medicaid 1,759,000 1,587,000 1,451,000 MA 290,000 213,000 135,000 PDP 797,000 869,000 976,000 Total 2,846,000 2,669,000 2,562,000 Membership 2013 vs. 2012 As of December 31, 2013 , we served approximately 2,846,000 members, an increase of approximately 177,000 members, or 7% , compared to December 31, 2012 . The growth in 2013 was mainly driven by acquisitions and organic membership growth in our Medicaid and MA segments, partially offset by a decline in PDP membership. By segment, membership changed as follows: Medicaid - membership increased approximately 172,000 compared to December 31, 2012 , primarily driven by our acquisitions of plans in South Carolina and Missouri in 2013, which contributed 50,000 and 104,000 members to the year-over-year increase, respectively, as well as membership growth in our Florida and Kentucky Medicaid programs. Kentucky Medicaid membership increased 85,000 compared to 2012, including approximately 57,000 members that were transferred to us following Centene's exit from Kentucky in July 2013 and 13,000 beneficiaries from Region 3 which we began serving effective January 1, 2013. These increases were partially offset by a decline of approximately 97,000 members resulting from our exit from Ohio, which was effective July 1, 2013. MA - membership increased approximately 77,000 compared to December 31, 2012 , due mainly to the results of the 2013 annual election period, which resulted in an increase of approximately 37,000 members effective January 1, 2013 due to our geographic expansion into 53 new counties in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, and Texas, as well as our continued focus on dually-eligible beneficiaries. PDP - membership decreased approximately 72,000 compared to December 31, 2012 as a result of our 2013 PDP bids, which resulted in the reassignment to other plans, effective January 1, 2013, of certain members who were auto-assigned to us in 2012 or prior years. 55 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 At December 31, 2012 , we served approximately 2,669,000 members; an increase of approximately 107,000 members from December 31, 2011 . We experienced membership growth in both our Medicaid and MA segments when compared to December 31, 2011, which was offset by a decline in PDP membership. By segment, membership changed as follows: Medicaid - membership increased by approximately 136,000 mainly from membership growth in Florida, membership growth in our Kentucky Medicaid program following its launch in the fourth quarter of 2011 and subsequent open enrollment in November 2012, and membership growth in our Hawaii Medicaid program due to our participation in Hawaii's QUEST program beginning in July 2012. Our Kentucky Medicaid membership increased from 129,000 at December 31, 2011 to 207,000 at December 31, 2012. Kentucky membership also increased due to retroactive member re-assignments. MA - membership increased by approximately 78,000 compared to December 31, 2011, due to the Easy Choice acquisition, and as a result of the 2012 annual election period, which resulted in an increase of approximately 10,000 members effective January 1, 2012, as well as our continued focus on dually-eligible beneficiaries and expansion into 19 new counties during 2012. Excluding the Easy Choice plan, MA membership as of December 31, 2012 was 174,000, an increase of 29% from December 31, 2011. PDP - membership decreased by approximately 107,000 compared to December 31, 2011 as a result of our 2012 PDP bids, which resulted in the reassignment to other plans, effective January 1, 2012, of members who were auto-assigned to us in 2011 or prior years. Net income 2013 vs. 2012 For the year ended December 31, 2013 , our net income was $175.3 million compared to $184.7 million for the same period in 2012 . The 5% decrease was mainly driven by the impact of lower net favorable development in prior year medical benefits payable, lower results in our PDP segment, consistent with lower membership, and increased interest expense and other costs resulting from higher average debt levels in 2013 associated with additional borrowings in February 2013 and November 2013, partially offset by increased premium revenue in our Medicaid and MA segments resulting from the membership increases noted above. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of current developments, operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. 2014 Outlook We expect our PDP segment will have a much more meaningful effect on our financial results in 2014 compared to 2013. Consequently, the seasonal pattern of PDP segment results will have a more pronounced effect on the aggregate company results, particularly in the first quarter. In addition, revenue recognition for the health insurance industry fee reimbursement from our state customers may not match the recognition of the fee expense until later in the year, and expenditures associated with our Florida MMA implementation will occur primarily in the first half, before we begin serving members and earning revenue. The combination of these factors will pressure first and second quarter earnings, and may result in a net loss in the first quarter. 2012 vs. 2011 For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net income was $184.7 million compared to $264.2 million for the same period in 2011. The $79.5 million, or 43%, decrease resulted mainly from a decrease in our Medicaid segment results, higher SG&A expenses driven by higher membership and higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with incremental software investments, partially offset by improved results in our MA and PDP segments. Net income for 2011 additionally benefited from the net-of-tax impact of a $10.8 million gain recognized on the repurchase of subordinated notes during December 2011. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. Premium revenue 2013 vs. 2012 56 Table of Contents Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $2.1 billion , or 28% , compared to the same period in 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to our 2012 and 2013 acquisitions, which collectively contributed $913.4 million , or 12%, to the year-over-year increase, organic membership growth in our Medicaid and MA segments and rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, including the 7% increase in Kentucky that was effective January 1, 2013. Additionally, the increase was partially attributable to Medicaid revenue from payment arrangements with certain states associated with primary care enhanced payments, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower membership in our PDP segment. Premium revenue includes $75.7 million and $82.2 million of Medicaid premium taxes for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 2012 vs. 2011 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by approximately $1.3 billion, or 21%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to membership growth in our Medicaid and MA segments and rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, offset by a $21.4 million reduction to premium revenue related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records in the Georgia Medicaid program dating back to the beginning of the program in 2006. Premium revenue includes $82.2 million and $76.2 million of Medicaid premium taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Investment and other income 2013 vs. 2012 Investment and other income in 2013 was $18.8 million , a $10.0 million increase from $8.8 million in 2012, primarily driven by higher volumes of prescription drug plan copayments and specialty prescription drugs sold to non-members. 2012 vs. 2011 Investment and other income amounted to $8.8 million in 2012, which was consistent with 2011 investment and other income of $8.7 million. Medical benefits expense 2013 vs. 2012 Total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $2.0 billion , or 31% compared to the same period in 2012 . The increase is due mainly to the increased membership in the Medicaid and MA segments, including acquisitions, the impact of lower net favorable development in prior year medical benefits payable, increased medical expense in the first quarter of 2013 associated with the flu and Medicaid primary care enhanced payments, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act, partially offset by a decrease in the PDP segment due to lower membership. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately $3.0 million of net favorable development related to prior periods compared to $76.7 million of such development recognized in 2012. 2012 vs. 2011 Total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $1.4 billion, or 27%, compared to the same period in 2011. The increase is due mainly to increased membership in the Medicaid and MA segments, higher overall utilization in the Medicaid and MA segments in the first half of 2012, the impact of higher net favorable development of prior period medical benefits payable experienced in 2011 compared to 2012 and the relatively higher medical benefits ratio ("MBR") in the Kentucky Medicaid program, partially offset by lower medical benefits expense in the PDP segment consistent with the decline in membership. For the year ended December 31, 2012, medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately $76.7 million of net favorable development related to prior periods compared to $191.2 million of such development recognized in 2011. Selling, general and administrative expense SG&A expense includes aggregate costs related to the resolution of the previously disclosed governmental investigations and related litigation, such as settlement accruals and related fair value accretion, legal fees and other similar costs. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of 57 Table of Contents investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs. We believe it is appropriate to evaluate SG&A expense exclusive of these investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs because we do not consider them to be indicative of long-term business operations. A reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding investigation-related costs, is presented below. For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 856.5 $ 690.8 $ 642.1 Adjustments: Investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs (2.5 ) (3.9 ) (7.7 ) Investigation-related administrative costs (54.8 ) (47.7 ) (39.3 ) Investigation-related administrative costs (57.3 ) (51.6 ) (47.0 ) SG&A expense, excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs $ 799.2 $ 639.2 $ 595.1 SG&A ratio (1) 9.1 % 9.4 % 10.6 % SG&A ratio, excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs 8.5 % 8.7 % 9.9 % (1) SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue, excluding premium taxes. 2013 vs. 2012 Excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $160.0 million , or 25% , to $799.2 million . The increase is driven mainly by the growth in membership, investments in technology and infrastructure, including costs necessary to meet regulatory changes, investments related to our medical cost initiatives,increased SG&A from the integration of recent acquisitions. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2013, we determined that we would be discontinuing certain projects going forward and, as a result, the software and development costs acquired to support these projects would not be fully recoverable. Consequently, we recorded a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $9.0 million. The increase in costs noted above were partially offset by improvements in operating efficiency. Our SG&A ratio, was 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 9.4% for the same period in 2012 . After excluding the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A ratio in 2013 was 8.5% compared to 8.7% for the same period in 2012 . 2014 Outlook We currently estimate that we will incur between approximately $125 and $135 million for the health insurance industry fees imposed by the Affordable Care Act in 2014, based on our estimated share of industry premiums. However, the final fee amount will not be determined until August 2014. Additionally, we currently expect spending for our 2014 growth initiatives and investments in our operational infrastructure will have a meaningful impact on 2014 results of operations. The investments in infrastructure are being made to better align our capabilities with the growth we have experienced and expect to achieve over the coming years. In particular, spending on 2014 growth initiatives will include the Florida MMA implementation and a significant amount of that spending will occur during the first half of 2014 before we begin serving members and earning revenue. Our adjusted administrative expense ratio for 2014 is expected to be between approximately 8.6% and 8.7%, an increase from 8.5% percent in 2013. We expect to report the health insurance industry fee expense separately from SG&A expense. Consequently, our administrative expense ratio guidance does not include the ACA fee. 2012 vs. 2011 Excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased approximately $44.2 million, or 7%, to $639.3 million. The increase was due to technology investments, 58 Table of Contents including those required by regulatory changes, as well as medical cost initiatives, increased spending related to the launch of our Kentucky Medicaid program, and other growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by improvements in operating efficiency. Our SG&A ratio was 9.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 10.6% for the same period in 2011. After excluding the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A ratio in 2012 was 8.7% compared to 9.9% for the same period in 2011. The improvement in our SG&A ratio is related to the growth in premium revenue and improvement in our administrative cost structure driven by business simplification projects, process management in our shared services functions, and continued evaluation of our organizational design. The improvement was partially offset by incremental costs incurred associated with our quality, regulatory and growth initiatives. Medicaid premium taxes 2013 vs. 2012 Medicaid premium taxes incurred for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $75.7 million compared to $82.2 million for the same period in 2012. The year-over-year decline of approximately $6.5 million , or 8% , was primarily driven by our exit from the Ohio Medicaid market, which was effective July 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, only our Medicaid contracts with Georgia, Hawaii and New York included tax assessments on Medicaid premiums. 2012 vs. 2011 Medicaid premium taxes incurred in the year ended December 31, 2012 were $82.2 million compared to $76.2 million for the same period in 2011. The $6.0 million, or 8%, increase was primarily driven by premium growth in New York and Hawaii. Depreciation and Amortization 2013 vs. 2012 Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $12.5 million , or 40% , to $44.1 million in 2013 from $31.6 million in 2012, which includes approximately $5.9 million of incremental amortization recorded during 2013 relating to the intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Desert Canyon, Easy Choice, Missouri Care and WCSC acquisitions. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to incremental infrastructure related investments made during 2013. 2012 vs. 2011 Depreciation and amortization expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $31.6 million , compared to $26.4 million for the same period in 2012. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to incremental infrastructure related investments made during 2012. Interest expense 2013 vs. 2012 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $11.9 million compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2012 . The $7.8 million increase was primarily driven by higher average debt levels during 2013, as we borrowed an additional $230 million in term loans under the 2011 credit agreement in February 2013 and, additionally, issued $600 million of 5.75% senior notes in November 2013. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes was used to payoff the remaining term loan balance under the 2011 credit agreement. 2014 Outlook We expect that interest expense will increase materially in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher average debt outstanding from the issuance of the Senior Notes, and is anticipated to be between $38 and $39 million. 2012 vs. 2011 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $4.1 million compared to $6.5 million for the same period in 2011. The decrease in interest expense from 2011 is mainly from debt incurred in 2011 to settle investigation-related litigation that was later redeemed in the fourth quarter of 2011, as discussed below, partially offset by interest on the $150.0 million borrowed under a term loan on August 1, 2011 under the 2011 Credit Agreement. 59 Table of Contents (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt 2013 In November 2013, a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of $600 million of 5.75% senior notes was used to pay off the remaining $336.5 million term loan balance, plus accrued interest, and we then terminated our 2011 credit agreement. In conjunction with the extinguishment of debt, we incurred approximately $2.8 million for the accelerated recognition of previously deferred financing costs. For further information regarding the 2013 debt transactions, refer to Note 12 Debt within the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2011 On December 15, 2011, we repurchased at 90% of face value all of the $112.5 million of subordinated notes issued in September 2011. The notes had an original maturity date of December 31, 2016. We recorded a gain on the repurchase of subordinated notes in the amount of $10.8 million. For further information regarding the subordinated notes, refer to Note 12 Debt within the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income tax expense 2013 vs. 2012 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $103.0 million , or 37.0% of pre-tax income, compared to $111.7 million , or 37.7% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The lower effective income tax rate in 2013 is primarily due to an issue resolution agreement reached with the Internal Revenue Service during 2013 regarding the tax treatment of certain investigation-related litigation and other resolution cost, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $7.6 million in income tax benefits during the first quarter of 2013, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible compensation under certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which generally limits deductions on executive compensation earned after December 31, 2009 that is paid after December 31, 2012. 2014 Outlook The health insurance industry fee imposed by the Affordable Care Act beginning in 2014 is not deductible for income tax purposes. Due principally to the impact of the fee, we anticipate that our 2014 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 50.5% to 51.5%. 2012 vs. 2011 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $111.7 million , or 37.7% of pre-tax income, compared to $154.2 million , or 36.9% of pre-tax income, for the year ended December 31, 2011 . The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased compared to the same period in 2011 due to the settlement of a state tax matter in 2012 which increased the effective rate, partially offset by a decrease in the prevailing state income tax rate. Segment Reporting Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the enterprise's decision-makers to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Accordingly, we have three reportable segments: Medicaid, MA and PDP. 60 Table of Contents Segment Performance Measures We use three measures to assess the performance of our reportable operating segments: premium revenue, MBR and gross margin. MBR measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue excluding Medicaid premium taxes. Gross margin is defined as premium revenue less medical benefits expense. For further information regarding premium revenues and medical benefits expense, please refer below to " Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable" , and " Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable " under " Critical Accounting Estimates." Our primary tools for measuring profitability are gross margin and MBR. Changes in gross margin and MBR from period to period depend in large part on our ability to, among other things, effectively price our medical and prescription drug plans, manage medical costs and changes in estimates related to IBNR claims, predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive, negotiate competitive rates with our health care providers, and attract and retain members. In addition, factors such as changes in health care laws, regulations and practices, changes in Medicaid and Medicare funding, changes in the mix of membership, escalating health care costs, competition, levels of use of health care services, general economic conditions, major epidemics, terrorism or bio-terrorism, new medical technologies and other external factors may affect our operations and may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We use gross margin and MBRs both to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions, including which health care plans to offer, which geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to select. Although gross margin and MBRs play an important role in our business strategy, we may be willing to enter new geographical markets and/or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable gross margin and MBR if those arrangements, such as capitation or risk sharing, would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs or for other reasons. Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our income from operations (before income taxes), as reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Gross Margin: (In millions) Medicaid $ 733.8 $ 579.2 $ 691.4 MA 411.5 305.8 281.0 PDP 105.2 211.3 177.7 Total gross margin 1,250.5 1,096.3 1,150.1 Investment and other income 18.8 8.8 8.7 Other expenses (988.2 ) (808.7 ) (751.2 ) Income from operations $ 281.1 $ 296.4 $ 407.6 Medicaid Our Medicaid segment includes plans for beneficiaries of TANF, Supplemental Security Income ("SSI"), Aged Blind and Disabled ("ABD") and other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP"), Family Health Plus ("FHP") and Managed Long-Term Care ("MLTC") programs. As of December 31, 2013, we operated Medicaid health plans in Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New York and South Carolina. We began serving WCSC members on February 1, 2013, and Missouri Care members on April 1, 2013. As of July 1, 2013, we no longer provided Medicaid services in Ohio. Impacting Our Results We received an approximate 7.0% premium rate increase for the Kentucky Medicaid program effective January 1, 2013, as well as an additional 3.0% rate effective July 1, 2013, which was previously scheduled for October 1, 2013. These rate increases apply to all Medicaid geographic regions of the Commonwealth, other than Region 3. 61 Table of Contents Membership within the Kentucky membership program grew approximately 85,000 , or 41% , during 2013 as we began serving approximately 13,000 beneficiaries in Region 3 for the Kentucky Medicaid program effective January 1, 2013, as well as approximately 57,000 beneficiaries transferred from Centene upon their exit from the program effective in July 2013. The acquisitions of WCSC and Missouri Care in January 2013 and March 2013, respectively, increased our membership by approximately 50,000 and 104,000 beneficiaries, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. We were not awarded a Medicaid contract in Ohio for the 2013 fiscal year; however, the state contracted with us to provide services to Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries through the transition period, which ended June 30, 2013. As of July 1, 2013, we no longer provided Medicaid services in Ohio. Ohio membership as of December 31, 2012 was approximately 97,000 . Medicaid Segment Results The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicaid segment for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 5,585.5 $ 4,389.0 $ 3,505.3 Medicaid premium taxes 75.7 82.2 76.2 Total premiums 5,661.2 4,471.2 3,581.5 Medical benefits expense 4,927.4 3,892.0 2,890.1 Gross margin $ 733.8 $ 579.2 $ 691.4 Medicaid Membership: Georgia 540,000 570,000 562,000 Florida 486,000 454,000 404,000 Kentucky 292,000 207,000 129,000 Other states (1) 441,000 356,000 356,000 1,759,000 1,587,000 1,451,000 Medicaid MBR, including premium taxes 87.0 % 87.0 % 80.7 % Medicaid MBR (2) 88.2 % 88.7 % 82.4 % (1) All other states consists of Hawaii, Illinois, and New York during all years presented. In 2011, it also includes Missouri and Ohio; in 2012, it also includes Ohio; and in 2013, it also includes Missouri and South Carolina. Effective as of June 30, 2012, our Missouri contract expired and was not renewed. We re-entered Missouri Medicaid in March 2013 when we acquired Missouri Care. We were not awarded a Medicaid contract in Ohio for the 2013 fiscal year; however, the state of Ohio contracted with us to provide services to Ohio Medicaid beneficiaries through a transition period, which ended June 30, 2013. (2) MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premium revenue excluding Medicaid premium taxes. Because Medicaid premium taxes are included in the premium rates established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these taxes from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that their impact is not indicative of operating performance. For GAAP reporting purposes, Medicaid premium taxes are included in premium revenue. 62 Table of Contents 2013 vs. 2012 Excluding Medicaid premium taxes, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $1.2 billion , or 27% , when compared to the same period in 2012 . The South Carolina and Missouri acquisitions increased premium revenue by $380.2 million , or 9% , to the year-over-year increase, while the remaining $816.3 million , or 18% increase, was driven primarily by increased membership in our Kentucky and Florida programs, a 7% rate increase in Kentucky that was effective on January 1, 2013, rate increases in certain other markets in late 2012, changes in geographic and demographic mix of members and Medicaid revenue from payment arrangements with certain states associated with primary care enhanced payments, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act. The increase in Kentucky Medicaid membership and premiums also reflect the commencement of services provided to beneficiaries in Region 3, which began on January 1, 2013, as well as the additional members received from Centene in July 2013. Medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 27% , which is consistent with the increase in membership and premiums. Our Medicaid MBR for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by approximately 50 basis points when compared to the same period in 2012, mainly reflecting the impact of improved results in Kentucky, partially offset by a lower amount of net favorable development of prior years' medical benefits payable in 2013 compared to 2012. The Kentucky program MBR declined to 90.0% in 2013 compared to 105.1% in 2012, as 2012 performance was adversely impacted by relatively high transitional medical benefit expenses for the program which launched in late 2011. The Missouri and South Carolina acquisitions also contributed to the decrease in the Medicaid segment MBR in 2013, as the MBR for these programs was lower than the segment average. 2012 vs. 2011 Excluding Medicaid premium taxes, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 25% when compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was driven mainly by the Kentucky Medicaid program operating for a full year in 2012, compared to two months in 2011, as well as membership growth in that program, both the managed long-term care program and the carve-in of the pharmacy benefit in our New York Medicaid program, membership growth in Florida, and rate increases implemented in most markets in late 2011. The increase in Kentucky Medicaid premiums also reflects the open enrollment in November 2012. Partially offsetting these increases was a $21.4 million reduction of premium revenue recorded during the second half of 2012 related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records in Georgia dating back to the beginning of the program in 2006. Medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 35% when compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was due mainly to the increase in membership and the relatively higher MBR in the Kentucky Medicaid program and less net favorable development of prior year's medical benefits payable in 2012 than we recognized in 2011, partially offset by the impact of medical cost initiatives that we have implemented. Our Medicaid MBR for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 630 basis points when compared to the same period in 2011. The increase was mainly driven by the relatively higher MBR in the Kentucky Medicaid program, which was adversely impacted by certain transitional medical benefit expenses for the program, the $21.4 million reduction of premium revenue for duplicate member record reconciliation adjustments and the impact of less net favorable development of prior year's medical benefits payable in 2012 than we recognized in 2011. 2014 Outlook We anticipate Medicaid segment premium revenue to increase approximately 22% to 23%, in 2014 compared to 2013, mainly as a result of the Florida MMA implementation, growth in Kentucky and our entry into New Jersey. We currently expect our Medicaid segment MBR in 2014 to be in the range of approximately 87.25% to 88.25%, compared to 88.2% percent in 2013. Our expected reimbursement by states of the ACA fee is impacting our 2014 MBR guidance by approximately 150 basis points. If the ACA reimbursement were not included in our guidance, our MBR guidance range would be higher by approximately 150 basis points, or between 88.75% and 89.75%. The expected increase in 2014 compared to 2013 results principally from the implementation of the Florida MMA program, which we expect to operate at an MBR that is higher than our 2013 performance in the state. Our anticipated Florida MMA premium also is higher than our historical experience to compensate us for the enhanced benefits and services required in the MMA program. In February 2014, our Florida Medicaid plan executed a contract with the Florida AHCA to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in eight of the state eleven regions as part of the state MMA program. These regions include the Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee and Tampa metropolitan areas. As result of the MMA contract awards, we anticipate that our Florida TANF and SSI membership should increase to at least 500,000 by December 2014, compared to the 394,000 members that we served in December 2013. 63 Table of Contents As a result of approval received from SCDHHS during November 2013, we began offering Medicaid services in 45 out of 46 counties in South Carolina effective January 1, 2014, an expansion of six counties from the 39 served at December 31, 2013. Additionally, effective January 1, 2014, membership from CMH transitioned to us as a result of changes SCDHHS is making to its Healthy Connections Choices Medicaid managed care program as well as WellCare's purchase of certain assets from CMH. We entered the New Jersey Medicaid program in January 2014 as a result of recent approval from the state to offer Medicaid managed care in certain counties. Our service area and presence in the New Jersey Medicaid program is anticipated to expand significantly upon closure of our pending acquisition of Healthfirst NJ, which is currently anticipated to close within the second quarter of 2014. We currently expect to be reimbursed by our state customers for the impact of the industry fee on our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. However, the timing of revenue recognition for such reimbursement may be delayed and not match the expense recognition of the fee, depending on the timing of contractual agreements. MA and PDP premium rates will not be adjusted to offset the impact of the fee. MA We contract with CMS under the Medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of Part C and Part D benefits to Medicare eligible persons. These benefits are provided through our MA plans, which are comprised of coordinated care plans ("CCPs"). CCPs are administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a primary care physician from a network of health care providers. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of our MA plans. As of December 31, 2013, we operated our MA CCPs in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Texas, and offered MA plans in a total of 204 counties across these14 states, with over 15 million eligible beneficiaries in these service areas. We offer duals special needs plans ("D-SNPs") in nearly all the counties that we serve, and approximately 33% of our MA members are "dually eligible" for Medicare and Medicaid and are enrolled in one of our D-SNPs. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans. For many of our plans, we provide additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced, which allows our members to better manage their health care costs. Impacting Our Results For 2013, we expanded our Medicare Advantage service area by 64 counties in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, New York, and Texas. Effective April 1, 2013, premium payments to MA plans were reduced by 2% pursuant to the sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. We have been able to partially offset this impact by a reduction in reimbursements to health care providers; however, our 2013 results of operations have been negatively impacted. MA Segment Results The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our MA segment for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 3,071.0 $ 1,936.4 $ 1,479.8 Medical benefits expense 2,659.5 1,630.6 1,198.8 Gross margin $ 411.5 $ 305.8 $ 281.0 MA Membership 290,000 213,000 135,000 MA MBR 86.6 % 84.2 % 81.0 % 2013 vs. 2012 64 Table of Contents MA premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $1.1 billion , or 59% , when compared to the same period in 2012 . The Easy Choice and Desert Canyon acquisitions contributed $533.2 million , or 27%, to the year-over-year growth, while the remaining $601.4 million , or 32% , increase was mainly attributable to organic membership growth associated with our service area expansion, higher risk adjusted premium, prior period revenue adjustments and the strengthening of our sales processes and our product design. The $1.0 billion , or 63% , increase in MA medical benefits expense during 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 reflects the increase in membership and premiums and increase in the MA segment MBR. MA segment MBR increased by 240 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012 due to the impact of Easy Choice, which operated at a higher MBR relative to the segment average, our 2013 plan design and the impact of the federal government's budget sequestration, partially offset by favorable prior period revenue adjustments. 2012 vs. 2011 MA premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $456.6 million , or 31% , when compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding the impact of the Easy Choice acquisition, MA premium revenue for 2012 increased by approximately $384.6 million , or 26% , compared to 2011 mainly attributable to organic membership growth due to our product design, strengthening of our sales processes and heightened focus on membership growth activities during the annual election period in 2011. MA segment MBR increased by 320 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The changes in the MBR were primarily due to increased quality improvement costs and less net favorable development of prior year's medical benefits payable in 2012 than we recognized in 2011. 2014 Outlook We expect premium revenue for our MA segment to increase approximately 22% to 24% in 2014 compared to 2013, driven mainly by the Windsor acquisition. For the MA segment, we currently expect the MBR in 2014 to be in the range of approximately 85% and 86%, compared to 86.6% in 2013. Our MA business will continue to be subjected to substantial margin compression in 2014. As a result of legislation passed in December 2013 (see Part I, Item 1 Business, General Economic and Political Environment Impacting our Business for additional discussion ), the 2% sequestration reduction to Medicare provider and plan payments will continue in 2014 and extend through 2023, so our results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted. In addition, our MA premium rates have not been adjusted to offset the impact of the health insurance industry fee assessment imposed by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, on April 1, 2013, CMS announced revised proposed 2014 benchmark rates, which will result in a rate decrease of approximately 2.0% to 4.0% from 2013 rates. In April 2013, CMS also announced changes to the MA and PDP Medicare risk adjustment system involving a risk coding recalibration which will be phased in over the 2014 and 2015 plan years. In addition, CMS will implement an MA coding intensity reduction of 4.91% for payment year 2014. This new risk adjustment model includes an adjustment to the calculation of health status cost risk based on each beneficiary diagnosis codes that will reduce the positive adjustments for high-risk patients and increase the negative adjustments for low-risk patients. The change appears to most severely affect our rates for those individuals with complex medical conditions, including many of our dual-eligible and lower income members. Excluding Windsor, MA membership as of January 1, 2014, was approximately 303,000, a growth of 13,000, or 5%, compared to December 31, 2013. In 2014, we plan to serve Medicare eligibles in 210 counties, up from 204 counties in 2013. We anticipate membership will continue to grow organically during the remaining months of 2014, though at a much slower pace than during 2013. Effective January 1, 2014, as a result of the Windsor acquisition, we began serving approximately 39,000 MA beneficiaries across 192 additional counties, primarily within the states of Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee. Including the membership gained from Windsor, as of January 1, 2014 we served a total of 342,000 MA beneficiaries in a total of 402 counties across 18 states. We expect to report the Medicare Supplement insurance business we acquired as part of the Windsor acquisition with our MA segment results. CMS 2014 MA quality ratings, also known as Star Ratings," reflected improvement for several of our plans. Based on the Star Ratings, 84% of our December 31, 2013 MA membership will be served in a plan rated three stars or better on an overall basis for 2014. Our MA plans that operate at 3 stars on a weighted, overall basis will earn a 3% quality bonus demonstration percentage, compared to the 5% available to 4, 4.5 and 5 star plans. 65 Table of Contents PDP We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDP plans to Medicare eligible beneficiaries through our PDP segment. As of December 31, 2013, we offered PDP plans in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The PDP benefit design generally results in our incurring a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages of a plan year, and less in the latter stages of a plan year, due to the members' share of cumulative out-of-pocket costs increasing throughout the plan year. As a result, the PDP MBR generally decreases throughout the year. Also, the level and mix of members who are auto-assigned to us as and those who actively choose our PDP plans will impact the segment MBR pattern across periods. Impacting Our Results Based on the outcome of our 2013 PDP bids, our plans were below the benchmarks in 14 of the 34 CMS regions and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in five other CMS regions. As a result of the 2013 bids, in 2013 we were auto-assigned newly-eligible members into our plans for the 14 regions that were below the benchmark. We retained our previously auto-assigned members in the five regions in which we bid within the de minimis range; however, we were not auto-assigned new members in those regions during 2013. Membership declined 72,000 , or 8% , at December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012, due primarily to the reassignment in January 2013 to other plans of members who were previously auto-assigned to us (primarily California), offset in part by additional auto-assignments to us in other regions and an increase in the members who actively chose our PDP plans. Effective April 1, 2013, premium payments to PDP plans were reduced by 2% pursuant to the sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and our 2013 results of operations were negatively impacted. PDP Segment Results The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our PDP segment for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 776.9 $ 992.6 $ 1,036.8 Medical benefits expense 671.7 781.3 859.1 Gross margin $ 105.2 $ 211.3 $ 177.7 PDP Membership 797,000 869,000 976,000 PDP MBR 86.5 % 78.7 % 82.9 % 2013 vs. 2012 PDP premium revenue decreased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the same period in 2012 , primarily due to the decline in membership and the outcome of our 2013 bids. PDP MBR for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 780 basis points over the same period in 2012 mainly due to the addition of our new enhanced product, designed for those who choose a PDP, and a shift in membership to this product, as well as higher drug unit costs and the outcome of our 2013 bids. Transition of care costs for the enhanced product also contributed to the increased MBR. The transition period concluded at the end of March. 2012 vs. 2011 PDP premium revenue decreased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to the decline in membership. Membership decreased by approximately 107,000 members from December 31, 2011 due to the reassignment to other plans, effective January 1, 2012, of members who were auto-assigned to us in 2011 or 66 Table of Contents prior years. PDP MBR for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 420 basis points over the same period in 2011 due to the outcome of our 2012 bids and improvements in our pharmacy claims experience, resulting from our focus on member utilization, cost sharing patterns and generic medication utilization. 2014 Outlook We anticipate that PDP segment premium revenue will increase 33% to 37% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of our membership growth, offset in part by lower premium rates resulting from our 2014 bids. We currently anticipate our PDP segment MBR for 2014 will be in the range of approximately 83.25% to 84.25%, down from 86.5% in 2013. The year-over-year decrease results mainly from the realignment of our benefit plans and cost structure, including the launch of our preferred pharmacy network. In particular, for our 2014 bids we were able to modify our enhanced plan through increased premium rates and cost sharing, as well as other changes. As a result of legislation passed in December 2013 (see Part I, Item 1 Business, General Economic and Political Environment Impacting our Business for additional discussion ), the 2% sequestration reduction to Medicare provider and plan payments will continue in 2014 and extend through 2023, so our results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted. Additionally, our PDP premium rates have not been adjusted to offset the impact of the health insurance industry fee assessment imposed by the Affordable Care Act. Excluding Windsor, PDP membership as of January 1, 2014 was approximately 1.1 million, an increase of approximately 320,000, or 40%, from 797,000 as of December 31, 2012. The increased membership in 2014 is primarily based on the outcome of our 2014 PDP bids, in which our plans were below the benchmarks in 30 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted 2014 bids. The favorable 2014 outcome resulted from the realignment of our benefit designs and cost structure to allow for prudent, competitive bids. In 2014, we are being auto-assigned newly-eligible members into our plans for the 30 regions that are below the benchmark. We are retaining our auto-assigned members in the three regions in which we bid within the de minimis range; however, we are not being auto-assigned new members in those regions during 2014. We expect membership to continue to grow organically during the remaining months of 2014. We have also launched a new PDP product that we believe is well positioned as a low-cost enhanced plan targeted to value-focused beneficiaries that actively choose their plan and as of January 1, 2014, approximately 70% of our membership is comprised of beneficiaries that actively chose us for their current plan. New members will be assigned monthly into our PDPs in 16 of our 18 2014 MA states, enabling cross selling opportunities for both our MA and PDP plans. Effective January 1, 2014, as a result of our acquisition of Windsor, we began serving approximately 154,000 individual and group beneficiaries across 11 of the 34 CMS regions. Including Windsor, January 2014 membership was approximately 1.2 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. Additionally, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent and other non-regulated companies ("non-regulated subsidiaries") are dependent upon dividends and management fees from our regulated subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors included in this 2013 Form 10-K. Liquidity The Company maintains liquidity at two levels: the regulated subsidiary level and the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level. Regulated subsidiaries Our regulated subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include: payment of medical claims and other health care services; management fees paid to our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under intercompany services agreements and direct administrative costs, which are not covered by an intercompany services agreement, such as selling expenses and legal costs; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. Our regulated subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by: 67 Table of Contents maintaining appropriate levels of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments; generating cash flows from operating activities, mainly from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. We refer collectively to the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as "regulated cash and investments." Our regulated subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, regulated cash and cash equivalents can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. Our unrestricted regulated cash and investments (which represent our regulated cash and investments not on deposit with a state in which we operate) was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, an increase of $200 million from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2012. The increase is due mainly to cash flows from operating activities as well as $55.0 million of contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries, partially offset by $147.0 million in dividends distributed to our non-regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated subsidiaries. See further discussion under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions below. Parent and non-regulated subsidiaries Liquidity requirements at the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level generally consist of: payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, business development, rent, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated subsidiaries; capital expenditures; debt service; and federal tax payments. Our non-regulated parent and subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by: management fees earned by our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under intercompany services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments. Unregulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $495.1 million at December 31, 2013, an increase of $301.6 million from $193.5 million at December 31, 2012. The increase was attributable to aggregate net proceeds of $451.4 million resulting from debt transactions executed during 2013, $147.0 million in dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries and cash flows from operations. The above increases were partially offset by cash used in relation to our 2013 acquisitions, as well as approximately $133.6 million advanced in December 2013 relating to the Windsor acquisition which closed in January 2014. $55.0 million of capital contributions made to certain regulated subsidiaries, total payments of $37.6 million made during the first half of 2013 in connection with our previously reported settlement with the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Civil Division"), as well as other certain investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs. The $133.6 million payment advanced for the Windsor acquisition was paid on December 31, 2013 in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement; however, control of ownership did not transfer to us until the January 1, 2014 closing date. Auction Rate Securities As of December 31, 2013, $31.8 million of our long-term investments were comprised of municipal note securities with an auction reset feature ("auction rate securities"), which are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans, public projects and other activities. Two auction rate securities with an aggregate fair value of $21.1 million have investment grade security credit ratings and one auction rate security with a fair value of $10.7 million has a credit rating below investment grade. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every seven or 35 68 Table of Contents days. As of the date of this 2013 Form 10-K, auctions have failed for our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions will succeed in the future. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven or 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non-existent. In addition, if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. Although auctions continue to fail, we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss. There are government guarantees or municipal bond insurance in place and we have the ability and the present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored. Accordingly, we do not believe our auction rate securities are impaired and as a result, we have not recorded any impairment losses for our auction rate securities. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments' recorded value. The final maturity as of December 2013 of the underlying securities could be as long as 24 years. The weighted-average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is 19 years. Cash Flow Activities Our cash flows are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 178.9 $ (30.7 ) $ 162.0 Net cash used in investing activities (290.5 ) (222.8 ) (111.6 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 493.6 28.9 (84.9 ) Total net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 382.0 $ (224.6 ) $ (34.5 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities We generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services; however, cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premiums receipts from our government partners or payments related to the resolution of government investigations and related litigation. 2013 vs. 2012 Cash provided by operating activities for 2013 was $178.9 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $30.7 million for 2012. The year-over-year improvement primarily resulted from the increase in premiums associated with the growth in membership. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted in 2013 and 2012 by approximately $37.6 million and $39.8 million, respectively, relating to payments made to the Civil Division under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed in "Financial Impact of Government Investigation and Litigation" below. 2011 vs. 2012 Cash used in operating activities in 2012 was $30.7 million compared to cash provided by operations of $162.0 million for 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash from operating activities was negatively impacted by certain delayed Medicaid premiums, primarily associated with our Georgia Medicaid supplemental payments for obstetric deliveries and newborns. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted in 2012 by approximately $39.8 million relating to payments made to the Civil Division under the terms of the settlement agreement, while in 2011 we paid approximately $87.5 million in connection with resolving shareholder class action complaints. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $290.5 million , $222.8 million , and $111.6 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011. The increase in cash used in 2013 compared to 2012 resulted principally from the $133.6 million advanced in December 2013 69 Table of Contents relating to the Windsor acquisition which closed in January 2014. The $133.6 million advance was completed on December 31, 2013 in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement; however, control of ownership did not transfer to us until January 1, 2014. The Windsor advance was partially offset by the impact from lower collective amounts paid in connection with the 2013 acquisitions as compared to the collective amounts paid in connection with the 2012 acquisitions. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $493.6 million and $28.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to a use of $84.9 million for 2011, which was impacted by the following: Aggregate net proceeds of $451.4 million resulting from the debt transactions executed during 2013, which includes net proceeds of $228.5 million received in connection with the second amendment to our 2011 credit agreement and $587.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes in November 2013, partially offset by $28.5 million of payments made on the term loan during the first three quarters of 2013. During November 2013, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes to pay off the remaining $336.5 million term loan balance under our 2011 credit agreement, plus accrued interest, and plan to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including organic growth opportunities and potential acquisitions. Net funds received for the benefit of members of $34.0 million and $36.3 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to a net cash outflow for the benefit of members of $129.6 million in 2011. These funds represent reinsurance, low-income cost sharing, and coverage gap discount subsidies funded by CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program, for which we assume no risk. Repurchase in full of approximately $101.7 million subordinated notes in 2011, which was offset by $147.4 million of proceeds, net of financing costs, resulting from the issuance of the term loan under the 2011 Credit Agreement. Financial Impact of Government Investigation and Litigation Under the terms of settlement agreements entered into on April 26, 2011, and finalized on March 23, 2012, to resolve matters under investigation by the Civil Division and certain other federal and state enforcement agencies (the "Settlement"), WellCare agreed to pay the Civil Division a total of $137.5 million in four equal annual principal payments, plus interest accrued at 3.125%. The estimated fair value of the discounted remaining liability was $70.3 million at December 31, 2013. The Settlement also provides for a contingent payment of an additional $35.0 million in the event that we are acquired or otherwise experience a change in control on or before April 30, 2015, provided that the change in control transaction exceeds certain minimum transaction value thresholds as specified in the Settlement. We currently maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance in the amount of $125.0 million for other matters not addressed above. Capital Resources Senior Notes In November 2013, we completed the offer and sale of $600.0 million of 5.75% unsecured senior notes due 2020 (the Senior Notes ). We received net proceeds of $587.9 million upon issuance of the Senior Notes, which consists of the $600.0 million principal balance of the notes less approximately $12.1 million incurred in debt issuance costs. The Senior Notes will mature on November 15, 2020, with interest on the Senior Notes being payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2014. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the full $336.5 million outstanding under the 2011 Credit Agreement, and will use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including organic growth opportunities and potential acquisitions. The indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our company and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; make other restricted payments and investments; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; create certain liens; 70 Table of Contents incur restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments, and in the case of our subsidiaries, guarantee indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; create unrestricted subsidiaries; and merge or consolidate with other entities. Credit Facilities In November 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") which provides for a senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ) of up to $300.0 million , which may be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for up to $75.0 million for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also provides that we may, at our option, increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an amount up to $75.0 million without the consent of any lenders not participating in such increase, subject to certain customary conditions and lenders committing to provide the increase in funding. The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility expire on November 14, 2018 and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be payable in full at that time. Unutilized commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a fee of 0.25% to 0.375% depending upon our ratio of total debt to cash flow. The Credit Agreement includes negative and financial covenants that limit certain activities of our company and its subsidiaries, including (i) restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness; and (ii) financial covenants that require (a) the ratio of total debt to cash flow not to exceed a maximum; (b) a minimum interest expense and principal payment coverage ratio; and (c) a minimum level of statutory net worth for our health maintenance organization and insurance subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, we may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Lenders holding at least 50% of the loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of the loans and/or terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. Additionally, in November 2013, we terminated the 2011 Credit Agreement in connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement described above. All amounts outstanding under the 2011 Credit Agreement were paid in full on November 14, 2013. For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 12 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Shelf Registration Statement In August 2012, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that became automatically effective covering the registration, issuance and sale of an indeterminate amount of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, senior or subordinated debt securities, depository shares, securities purchase contracts, units or warrants. We may publicly offer securities in the future at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Issuance and Repurchase of Subordinated Notes On September 30, 2011, we issued tradable unsecured subordinated notes having an aggregate par value of $112.5 million, in connection with the settlement of putative class action complaints filed against us in 2007. On December 15, 2011, we paid $101.7 million to repurchase the subordinated notes at a 10% discount and paid accrued interest of approximately $4.1 million. For further information regarding the subordinated notes, refer to Note 12 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We may pursue alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives may include, but are not limited to, obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries, provided sufficient capital in excess of regulatory requirements exists in these subsidiaries, and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute 71 Table of Contents or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, a statutory minimum, risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the NAIC, and have been adopted by most states. As of December 31, 2013, our operating HMO and insurance company subsidiaries in all states except California, New York and Florida were subject to RBC requirements. The RBC requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state. The RBC formula, based on asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk, business risk and other factors, generates the authorized control level ("ACL"), which represents the amount of capital required to support the regulated entity's business. For states in which the RBC requirements have been adopted, the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of 200% of the required ACL or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre-RBC guidelines. Our subsidiaries operating in Texas and Ohio are required to maintain statutory capital at RBC levels equal to 225% and 300%, respectively, of the applicable ACL. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. At December 31, 2013, our HMO and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements. The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was approximately $1.1 billion and $926.0 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the required surplus of approximately $489.0 million and $383.0 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries' minimum capital requirements changes over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. These subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators' overall oversight powers. For example, the State of New York adopted regulations that increase the reserve requirement annually until 2018. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies. Moreover, if we expand our plan offerings in a state or pursue new business opportunities, we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions. In addition to the foregoing requirements, our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans and other transfers of cash. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. Some states require prior approval of all dividends, regardless of amount. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior 12 months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we received $147.0 million , $192.0 million and $92.0 million respectively, in cash dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. For additional information on regulatory requirements, see Note 17 Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 . Payments due to period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (In millions) Operating leases $ 67.9 $ 20.0 $ 27.6 $ 13.5 $ 6.8 Capital leases 1.5 1.5 Purchase obligations (1) 147.3 84.4 62.7 0.2 Amounts accrued related to investigation resolution (2) 70.3 36.2 34.1 Long-term debt 600.0 600.0 Interest on debt (3) 237.2 34.5 69.0 69.0 64.7 Total $ 1,124.2 $ 176.6 $ 193.4 $ 82.7 $ 671.5 72 Table of Contents (1) Our purchase obligations include commitments under contracts for equipment leases, software maintenance and the purchase of pharmaceuticals from our pharmacy benefit manager. (2) Based on the terms of the settlement agreement reached with the Civil Division effective as of March 23, 2012, as discussed in Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Represents projected interest on our 5.75% $600.0 million Senior Notes. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2013 , we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table above. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable, medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable, and goodwill and intangible assets, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable We earn premium revenue through our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid-related and Medicare programs. Our contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts establish fixed, monthly rates per member ("PMPM"). However, our contracts also have additional provisions as described in the sections below. The premiums we receive for each member vary according to the specific government program and are generally determined at the beginning of each new contract renewal period or each state's fiscal year; however, premiums may be adjusted by CMS and state agencies throughout the terms of the contracts in certain cases, as described below. For a further description of the revenue elements related to our segments, see Part I - Item 1 - Business - OUR PRODUCT SEGMENTS . In some instances, our fixed Medicaid premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the acuity of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the sta te agency's analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's Medicaid membership. We recognize premium revenue in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. We are generally paid by CMS and state agencies in the month in which we provide services. On a monthly basis, we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan. We record premiums earned but not received as premiums receivable, and record premiums received in advance of the period of service as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheets. Unearned premiums are recognized as revenue when we provide the related service. Member premiums are recognized as revenue in the period of service. We estimate, on an ongoing basis, the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible based on our evaluation of historical trends. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible. In addition, we routinely monitor the collectability of specific premiums receivable, including Medicaid receivables for obstetric deliveries and newborns (see " Medicaid " below) and net receivables for member retroactivity as described below, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. Historically, the allowance for member premiums receivable has not been significant relative to premium revenue. Premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by CMS and state agencies. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, CMS and state agencies require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received for individuals who were subsequently determined by us, or by CMS or state agencies, to be ineligible for any government-sponsored program or to belong to a plan other than ours. Additionally, the verification of membership may result in additional premiums due to us from CMS and state agencies for individuals who were 73 subsequently determined to belong to our plan for periods in which we received no premium for those members. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. We record the amounts receivable or payable identified by us through reconciliation and verification of membership eligibility lists, which relate to current and prior periods, in premiums receivable, net and other accrued expenses and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In 2012, we settled with the Georgia Department of Community Health (the "Georgia DCH") regarding retroactive premium adjustments related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records dating back to the beginning of the program in 2006. As a result, we revised our previous estimates for additional premium revenue receivable related to a previous settlement negotiated with the Georgia DCH in 2011 and we recorded related reductions of premium revenue totaling approximately $21.4 million during the third and fourth quarters of 2012. The settlement resolved issues with certain premium payments that covered the period from the inception of the program through the settlement, and resulted from a comprehensive review and negotiation involving the three health plans that operate in the program. Medicaid We earn supplemental premium payments for eligible obstetric deliveries and newborns of our Medicaid members in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New York, South Carolina and, until June 30, 2013, Ohio. Each state Medicaid contract specifies how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid. In some instances, our Medicaid fixed base PMPM premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the health profile of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the state agency's analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's Medicaid membership. In some states, supplemental payments are received for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings. Upon delivery of a newborn, the state agency is notified according to the contract terms. Revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member. Minimum Medical Expense Provisions Our Florida Medicaid and Healthy Kids contracts and Illinois Medicaid contract require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical benefits expense. To the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical benefits expense, we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical benefits expense. We estimate the amounts due to the state agencies as a return of premium based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency. Such amounts are included in results of operations as reductions of premium. Medicare Advantage (MA) The amount of premiums we receive for each MA member is established by contract, although the rates vary according to a combination of factors, including upper payment limits established by CMS, a member's geographic location, age, gender, medical history or condition, or the services rendered to the member. Changes to monthly premiums are also based upon a member's health status as described under " Medicare Risk-Adjusted Premiums " below. We also offer coverage of prescription drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program as a component of most of our MA plans. See further discussion of revenue recognition policies specific to Medicare Part D in "PDP" below. Medicare Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS employs a risk-adjustment model to determine the premium amount it pays for each MA and PDP member. This model apportions premiums paid to all plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled, resulting in higher scores for members with predictably higher costs. The model uses diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings to calculate each risk score. We collect claims and encounter data for our MA members and submit the necessary diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. After reviewing the respective submissions, CMS establishes the premium payments to MA plans at the beginning of the plan year, and then adjusts premium levels on a retroactive basis. The first retroactive adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year and represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retroactive risk-adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year. 74 We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We populate our models with available risk score data on our members and base risk premium adjustments on risk score data from the previous year. We are not privy to risk score data for members new to our plans in the current plan year; therefore we include assumptions, if estimable, regarding these members' risk scores. We periodically revise our estimates of risk-adjusted premiums as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjust our estimates to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. As a result of the variability of factors that determine our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums, the actual amount of the CMS retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates and could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We record any changes in estimates in current operations as adjustments to premium revenue. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately received. However, during the third quarter of 2013, we recognized risk adjusted premium received as part of the 2012 final settlement that was higher than our original estimates, mainly related to members in our California MA plan that were new to Medicare in 2012. Additionally, the data provided to CMS to determine members' risk scores is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. Our Florida and Arizona MA plans have been selected by CMS for audits of the 2011 contract year and we anticipate that CMS will conduct audits of other contracts and contract years on an on-going basis. An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, future refunds could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which CMS determines a refund is required and could be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. PDP Substantially all the premium that we receive for Medicare Part D coverage is paid by CMS, and the balance is due from enrolled members. The premium amounts received from CMS are based on the plan year bid submitted to CMS. The monthly payment is a risk-adjusted amount per member and is based upon the member's health status as determined by CMS, as more fully described above under " Medicare Risk Adjusted Premiums" . As we do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our stand-alone PDP members, we cannot anticipate changes in our members' risk scores. Changes in CMS premiums related to risk-score adjustments for our stand-alone PDP membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, which occurs when we are notified by CMS of such adjustments. Low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount subsidies Low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount subsidies represent funding from CMS for which we assume no risk. The receipt of these subsidies and the payments of the actual prescription drug costs related to the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discounts are not recognized as premium revenues or benefits expense, but are reported on a net basis as funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. These receipts and payments are reported as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Approximately nine months after the close of the annual plan year, except for the coverage gap discount which has a longer settlement timeframe, CMS reconciles actual experience to prospective payments paid to our plans and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments related to the CMS annual reconciliation of prior plan year low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance subsidies or coverage gap discount subsidies. CMS risk corridor Premiums received from CMS are subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. The CMS risk corridor calculation compares our actual experience to the target amount of prescription drug costs, limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by CMS, less rebates included in our submitted plan year bid. We receive additional premium from CMS if our actual claims experience is more than 5% above the target amount. We refund premiums to CMS if our actual claims experience is less than 5% below the target amount. We estimate the risk corridor receivable or payable throughout the year as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period and reflect any adjustments to premium in current operations. This estimate provides no consideration of future pharmacy claims experience, but does require us to consider factors that may not be certain, including membership, risk scores, prescription drug events, and rebates. Approximately nine months after the close of the annual plan year, CMS reconciles actual experience to the target amount and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments related to the CMS settlement of prior years' risk corridor estimates. 75 Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable The cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of incurred but not reported ("IBNR") medical benefits. Medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR, and includes direct medical expenses and medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians and providers of ancillary services, such as laboratories and pharmacies. Recorded direct medical expenses are reduced by the amount of pharmacy rebates earned, which are estimated based on historical utilization of specific pharmaceuticals, current utilization and contract terms. Pharmacy rebates earned but not yet received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are included in pharmacy rebates receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Direct medical expenses may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Also, included in direct medical expense are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing arrangements. Medically-related administrative costs such as preventive health and wellness, care management, case and disease management, and other quality improvement costs are included in medical benefits expense. Other medically-related administrative costs such as utilization review services, network and provider credentialing and claims handling costs, are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable: December 31, 2013 % of Total December 31, 2012 % of Total (In millions) IBNR $ 690.1 72% $ 547.4 75% Other medical benefits payable 263.3 28% 185.6 25% Total medical benefits payable $ 953.4 100% $ 733.0 100% Medical benefits payable is the most significant estimate included in the consolidated financial statements. We use a consistent methodology to record management's best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time. This estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions, which vary by business segment. These standard actuarial methodologies include using, among other factors, contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefits changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business and changes in membership. The factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset, since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors, in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months' utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. 76 Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. These aspects include the incidences of illness or disease (such as congestive heart failure cases, cases of upper respiratory illness, the length and severity of the flu season, diabetes cases, the number of full-term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies). Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. Among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members, seasonal variations in utilization, identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements, including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee-for-service basis. These considerations are reflected in the trends in our medical benefits expense. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Management uses considerable judgment in determining medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2013 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2013 were decreased by 1%, our net income would decrease by approximately $92.8 million. If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our net income would increase by approximately $94.9 million. After determining an estimate of the base reserve, actuarial standards of practice require that a margin for uncertainty be considered in determining the estimate for unpaid claim liabilities. If such a margin is included, the claim liabilities should be adequate under moderately adverse conditions. Therefore, we make an additional estimate in the process of establishing the IBNR, which also uses standard actuarial techniques, to account for moderately adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than estimated compared to the base reserve. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. The provision for moderately adverse conditions is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our IBNR reserve and is intended to capture the potential adverse development from factors such as our entry into new geographical markets, our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled, the variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical cost, changes in provider reimbursement arrangements, variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment, the severity of claims, and outbreaks of disease such as the flu. Because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states, we make an overall assessment of IBNR after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for moderately adverse conditions. We consistently apply our IBNR estimation methodology from period to period. We review our overall estimates of IBNR on a monthly basis. As additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of IBNR. Therefore, if moderately adverse conditions do not occur, evidenced by more complete claims information in the following period, then our prior period estimates will be revised downward, resulting in favorable development. However, when a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase determined to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims, we do not consider that development amount as having any impact on net income during the period. If moderately adverse conditions occur and are more than we estimated, then our prior period estimates will be revised upward, resulting in unfavorable development, which would decrease current period net income. Changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. Volatility in members' needs for medical services, provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur. Since our estimates are based upon PMPM claims experience, changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor, but are the result of a number of interrelated variables, all of which influence the resulting medical cost trend. Differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as prior period developments, are recorded in the period when such differences become known and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense in such periods. 77 The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 733.0 $ 744.8 $ 743.0 Acquisitions 71.6 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current period 8,333.2 6,450.5 5,200.1 Prior periods (74.6 ) (146.6 ) (252.1 ) Total 8,258.6 6,303.9 4,948.0 Medical benefits paid related to: Current period (7,490.6 ) (5,754.9 ) (4,533.9 ) Prior periods (619.2 ) (560.8 ) (412.3 ) Total (8,109.8 ) (6,315.7 ) (4,946.2 ) Balances as of end of period $ 953.4 $ 733.0 $ 744.8 Medical benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 developed favorably by approximately $74.6 million , $146.6 million and $252.1 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. A portion of the prior period development was attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, which is included as part of the assumptions. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year. Accordingly, the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the Medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period. In addition to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, medical benefits expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was impacted by approximately $3.0 million , $76.7 million and $191.2 million respectively, of net favorable development related to prior years. The net favorable development in 2013 was due mainly to the medical cost trend emerging favorably in our Medicaid segment due to lower utilization. The net favorable development in 2012 was due to the medical cost trend emerging favorably, mostly in our Medicaid segment and to a lesser extent in our MA and PDP segments, primarily due to lower than projected utilization, partially offset by higher than expected medical services in Kentucky. The net favorable development during 2011 was attributable to the 2010 medical cost trend emerging favorably than we originally estimated, mostly in our Medicaid segment and to a lesser extent in our MA segment, primarily due to lower than projected utilization. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2013 was $236.8 million , which consisted of $126.8 million and $110.0 million attributable to our Medicaid and Medicare Advantage reporting segments, respectively. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2012 was $223.8 million , which consisted of $111.1 million and $112.7 million attributable to our Medicaid and Medicare Advantage reporting segments, respectively. Other intangible assets include provider networks, broker networks, trademarks, state contracts, non-compete agreements, licenses and permits. We amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to 15 years. These assets are allocated to reporting segments for impairment testing purposes. 78 We review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in our business climate occur that may potentially affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or intangible assets. Such events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, federal and state government contracts and provider networks. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units using a two-step approach. In the first step, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using both income and market approaches. We calculate fair value based on our assumptions of key factors such as projected revenues and the discount factor. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and may produce significantly different results. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we measure and record the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test based on our financial position and results of operations through the second quarter of each year, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process. In 2013, we elected to bypass the optional qualitative fair value assessment and conducted our annual quantitative test for goodwill impairment during the third quarter of 2013. Based on the results of our quantitative test, we determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no further testing was required, and we believe that such assets are not impaired as of December 31, 2013.
