ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Item 1. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT More than 60 percent of our revenues are from the U.S. government. Accordingly, our financial performance is impacted by U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending. Over the past several years, U.S. defense spending has been reduced, due in part to the country fiscal shortfall. To address this shortfall, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) mandated a $487 billion , or 8 percent , reduction to previously-planned defense funding over 10 years. The BCA also included a mechanism, referred to as the sequester, that can impose additional defense cuts of up to $500 billion , or 9 percent , over nine years starting in fiscal year (FY) 2013. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) prescribed defense top-line funding for FY 2014 and 2015 at levels generally consistent with FY 2013, reducing budget uncertainties and providing near-term stability. The BBA also included sequester reductions of approximately $30 billion in FY 2014 and $43 billion in FY 2015, less than the amounts imposed by the BCA. In adherence to the BBA, Congress appropriated $497 billion in FY 2014 for the Department of Defense (DoD), including approximately $156 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D) budgets, also known as investment accounts, relatively consistent with FY 2013. These investment accounts are the source of the majority of our U.S. government revenues. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is buoyed by the relevance of our programs to the U.S. military funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution. We continue to pursue opportunities outside the U.S. presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies from our international operations and through exports from our North American businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, our work for these customers is subject to changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures, as well as timing of contract awards. In our Aerospace group, business-jet market conditions were strong in 2013. The group benefited from improved order interest across the group range of customers and lower customer contract defaults. We expect our continued investment in new aircraft products to support Aerospace long-term growth. Similarly, we believe aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by the global installed business-jet fleet. 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION An understanding of our accounting practices is important to evaluate our operating results. We recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our Aerospace and defense groups. In the Aerospace group, contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft outfitting, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors. We record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) completions and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (green and outfitted), progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period. The majority of the Aerospace group operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor, material and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace group completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred. For new aircraft, operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned aircraft, and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net R&D costs incurred by the group. In the defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume, typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules. Operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor, material, subcontractor, overhead and G&A costs and are recognized generally as incurred. Variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and, therefore, result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues. Operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the value of that contract that the profitability of that contract may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- vs. lower-margin 26 work. Additionally, higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production). CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW REVIEW OF 2012 VS. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2012 2013 Variance Revenues $ 31,513 $ 31,218 $ (295 ) (0.9 )% Operating costs and expenses 30,680 27,533 3,147 10.3 % Operating earnings 833 3,685 2,852 342.4 % Operating margins 2.6 % 11.8 % Our revenues were essentially flat in 2013 compared with 2012 despite a challenging business environment that included a 16-day partial U.S. government shutdown. We experienced lower volume in our Combat Systems business as a result of decreased U.S. Army spending and delays in international orders. This was largely offset by higher revenues in our Aerospace group from increased deliveries of G650 and G280 aircraft. Revenues increased slightly in our Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups in 2013 . Operating costs were lower in 2013 due to several discrete charges in 2012 , most significantly a $2 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group. These charges are discussed below in conjunction with our business groups operating results. Operating earnings and margins increased significantly in 2013 due to improved operating performance. REVIEW OF 2011 VS. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 32,677 $ 31,513 $ (1,164 ) (3.6 )% Operating costs and expenses 28,851 30,680 (1,829 ) (6.3 )% Operating earnings 3,826 833 (2,993 ) (78.2 )% Operating margins 11.7 % 2.6 % Our revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 due to lower volume in the Information Systems and Technology group mobile communication systems business and on several European wheeled vehicle contracts in the Combat Systems group. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in the Aerospace group due to increased deliveries of G650 aircraft. Operating costs increased in 2012 due to the discrete charges referenced above, resulting in lower operating earnings and margins. 27 REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 2013 Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Aerospace $ 5,998 $ 729 $ 6,912 $ 858 $ 8,118 $ 1,416 Combat Systems 8,827 1,283 7,992 663 6,120 904 Marine Systems 6,631 691 6,592 750 6,712 666 Information Systems and Technology 11,221 1,200 10,017 (1,369 ) 10,268 795 Corporate (77 ) (69 ) (96 ) $ 32,677 $ 3,826 $ 31,513 $ 833 $ 31,218 $ 3,685 Following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group results. Information regarding our business groups also can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. AEROSPACE Review of 2012 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2012 2013 Variance Revenues $ 6,912 $ 8,118 $ 1,206 17.4 % Operating earnings 858 1,416 558 65.0 % Operating margins 12.4 % 17.4 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 121 139 18 14.9 % Outfitted 94 144 50 53.2 % The increase in the Aerospace group revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 1,061 Aircraft services 39 Pre-owned aircraft 106 Total increase $ 1,206 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues increased in 2013 primarily due to additional deliveries of G650 and G280 aircraft. Production rates for these aircraft have been ramping up since their initial green deliveries in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Pre-owned aircraft sales increased as we sold 11 aircraft in 2013 as compared to three in 2012 . The group had one pre-owned aircraft available for sale on December 31, 2013. The increase in the group operating earnings in 2013 consisted of the following: 28 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 376 Aircraft services 222 Pre-owned aircraft (9 ) G&A/other expenses (31 ) Total increase $ 558 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions earnings increased in 2013 primarily due to the increase in aircraft deliveries discussed above. In addition to improved performance, aircraft services earnings increased in 2013 primarily due to the impairment charge taken in 2012 discussed below. In the completions and maintenance businesses, Jet Aviation made positive contributions throughout 2013 following actions to reduce costs and improve operational processes. Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 5,998 $ 6,912 $ 914 15.2 % Operating earnings 729 858 129 17.7 % Operating margins 12.2 % 12.4 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 107 121 14 13.1 % Outfitted 99 94 (5 ) (5.1 )% The Aerospace group revenues and operating earnings increased in 2012 primarily due to increased green deliveries of G650 aircraft, which began in the fourth quarter of 2011. Losses in Jet Aviation completions business in 2011 included a $111 impairment of the completions business intangible asset and $78 of project losses, while 2012 was negatively impacted by a $191 impairment of the maintenance business intangible assets. During 2011 and 2012, Jet Aviation completions and maintenance businesses suffered from an increasingly competitive marketplace and performance issues. 2014 Outlook With continued growth in deliveries of newer Gulfstream aircraft models, we expect an increase of approximately 11 percent in the group revenues in 2014 compared with 2013 . Operating margins are expected to be around 17 percent . COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2012 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2012 2013 Variance Revenues $ 7,992 $ 6,120 $ (1,872 ) (23.4 )% Operating earnings 663 904 241 36.3 % Operating margins 8.3 % 14.8 % The decrease in the Combat Systems group revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: U.S. military vehicles $ (1,389 ) Weapons systems and munitions (439 ) European military vehicles (44 ) Total decrease $ (1,872 ) 29 In 2013 , revenues were down as a result of decreased U.S. Army spending, in part due to sequestration and the government shutdown. This impacted U.S. military vehicle programs, including Stryker, Abrams and Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP), and weapons systems and munitions, including axles, Hydra-70 rockets, guns and ammunition. In addition, revenues in the group European military vehicles business were down slightly due to final vehicle deliveries in 2012 on Duro and Eagle wheeled vehicle contracts for the Swiss and German governments, respectively. In response to decreased customer spending and to align our business with anticipated future demand, we implemented cost reduction initiatives in 2013 throughout the group. We reduced headcount by more than 25 percent in our U.S. and European military vehicles businesses. Additionally, we consolidated our weapons systems and munitions businesses. Our actions are intended to help us remain competitively positioned for the future while creating opportunities for margin improvement. The Combat Systems group operating earnings and margins increased in 2013 primarily due to the 2012 discrete charges in our European military vehicles business discussed below that reduced the group operating margins approximately 530 basis points. Operating earnings and margins also increased 120 basis points in 2013 due to strong performance across our U.S. businesses and the favorable impact of cost savings associated with restructuring activities in our European military vehicles business. Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 8,827 $ 7,992 $ (835 ) (9.5 )% Operating earnings 1,283 663 (620 ) (48.3 )% Operating margins 14.5 % 8.3 % The Combat Systems group revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 due to lower volume in the group European military vehicles and weapons systems and munitions businesses. In the group European military vehicles business, revenues were down in 2012 on contracts with various international customers that were nearing completion, including contracts for Piranha, Duro and Eagle vehicles. Volume was down across several U.S. armament and munitions programs in 2012 due to slowed defense spending, including vehicle armor, MK47 grenade launchers and Hydra-70 rockets. The sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011 also resulted in lower revenues in the weapons systems and munitions business in 2012. The Combat Systems group operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in 2012 due to the negative impact of three discrete charges in our European military vehicles business: $292 for contract dispute accruals, primarily related to the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles for Portugal ($169 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues); $98 of restructuring-related charges, primarily severance, for activities associated with eliminating excess capacity; and $67 of out-of-period adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2012 ($48 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues). 2014 Outlook We expect the Combat Systems group revenues in 2014 to decrease 4 to 4.5 percent from 2013 with operating margins approximating 14 percent. Our outlook assumes approximately $1.2 billion in revenues from an international order expected in the first quarter of 2014. 30 MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2012 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2012 2013 Variance Revenues $ 6,592 $ 6,712 $ 120 1.8 % Operating earnings 750 666 (84 ) (11.2 )% Operating margins 11.4 % 9.9 % The increase in the Marine Systems group revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: Navy ship construction $ (150 ) Navy ship engineering, repair and other services 178 Commercial ship construction 92 Total increase $ 120 The group U.S. Navy ship-construction programs include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers, and Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) auxiliary support ships. The decrease in 2013 construction revenues is due to the completion of the T-AKE combat-logistics ship program in late 2012. Partially offsetting this decrease, revenues increased on the Virginia-class program, primarily due to long-lead material for the initial boats on the next block of submarines. Revenues were higher on engineering and repair programs for the Navy in 2013 due to increased submarine overhaul and repair work. Commercial ship construction revenues increased as work commenced on contracts for Jones Act ships secured in late 2012 and 2013. Operating earnings and margins decreased in 2013 due to the completion of the mature, higher-margin T-AKE program in 2012. Excluding the impact of this program, operating margins improved in 2013 . Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 6,631 $ 6,592 $ (39 ) (0.6 )% Operating earnings 691 750 59 8.5 % Operating margins 10.4 % 11.4 % Revenues in the Marine Systems group decreased slightly in 2012 as lower Navy ship construction revenues were largely offset by higher revenues on engineering and repair programs for the Navy. Decreased Navy ship construction revenues on the Virginia-class and the T-AKE programs were partially offset by an increase on the MLP and DDG programs. Higher revenues on Navy engineering and repair programs were driven by the acquisition of two East Coast surface-ship repair operations and higher volume on the Ohio-class replacement engineering program. Despite the decline in revenues, the Marine Systems group operating earnings increased in 2012 . Increases in the T-AKE profit rate contributed $53 to the operating earnings growth, approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion, as the program continued to experience favorable cost performance through construction and delivery of the final ship. 31 2014 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group 2014 revenues to increase 2.5 percent from 2013 with operating margins approximating 9.5 percent. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2012 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2012 2013 Variance Revenues $ 10,017 $ 10,268 $ 251 2.5 % Operating earnings (loss) (1,369 ) 795 2,164 158.1 % Operating margins (13.7 )% 7.7 % The increase in the Information Systems and Technology group revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: Mobile communication systems $ 232 Information technology (IT) solutions and mission support services 189 Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems (170 ) Total increase $ 251 Revenues increased in 2013 in the mobile communication systems business due to higher volume on key programs that received significant production awards in late 2012 or 2013, including the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), Handheld, Manpack and Small Form-Fit (HMS) and Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) programs. The IT services business added more than 8,000 employ ees throughout the year to meet commercial wireless customers accelerated schedules for IT infrastructure services and to start work on a contract to provide contact-center services for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, resulting in increased revenues in 2013 . Revenues decreased in 2013 across the ISR business driven by lower U.S. defense spending and a slower-than-expected transition to related follow-on work. The Information Systems and Technology group operating earnings and margins increased in 2013 due to several discrete charges taken in 2012 discussed below. Excluding these charges, operating margins decreased slightly in 2013 primarily due to growth in the lower-margin IT services business and performance challenges in the group U.K. business. The U.K. business was consolidated into our North American mobile communication systems business in 2013. Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 11,221 $ 10,017 $ (1,204 ) (10.7 )% Operating earnings 1,200 (1,369 ) (2,569 ) (214.1 )% Operating margins 10.7 % (13.7 )% The Information Systems and Technology group revenues were down in 2012 compared with 2011 , driven primarily by lower revenues in the mobile communication systems business. Revenues in this business were impacted unfavorably by slowed defense spending and protracted U.S. customer acquisition cycles. This resulted in lower revenues in 2012 on key programs including WIN-T and CHS, and in encryption and ruggedized hardware products. In addition, more than 10 percent of the decline in the group revenues 32 was due to lower volume on the U.K.-based Bowman communication system program, which was fielded successfully and moved into maintenance and long-term support. Operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in 2012 compared with 2011 driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges: $2 billion goodwill impairment resulting from a decline in the estimated fair value of the group caused by topline pressure from slowed defense spending and the threat of sequestration, coupled with margin compression due to a shift in the group contract mix impacting projected cash flows; $110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business, most significantly the contract and program intangible asset, as a result of competitive losses and delays in 2012 indicative of lower overall demand caused by the economic downturn; $58 write-down of substantially all of the remaining ruggedized hardware inventory based on anticipated remaining demand for products that ceased production in 2012; and $26 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the U.K. Specialist Vehicle (SV) program. 2014 Outlook We expect 2014 revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to decrease nearly 20 percent from 2013 , largely due to award delays and slowed defense spending on major production programs in the mobile communication systems business. Operating margins are expected to be in the low-8 percent range. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options. Corporate operating costs totaled $77 in 2011 , $69 in 2012 and $96 in 2013 . We expect 2014 Corporate operating costs of approximately $85 . OTHER INFORMATION PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUES AND OPERATING COSTS Review of 2012 vs. 2013 Year Ended December 31 2012 2013 Variance Revenues: Products $ 19,784 $ 19,371 $ (413 ) (2.1 )% Services 11,729 11,847 118 1.0 % Operating Costs: Products $ 16,228 $ 15,296 $ (932 ) (5.7 )% Services 10,182 10,158 (24 ) (0.2 )% The decrease in product revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: 33 Military vehicle production $ (1,218 ) Weapons systems and munitions production (430 ) Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 1,123 Other, net 112 Total decrease $ (413 ) In 2013 , military vehicle production revenues decreased on several programs, including the Stryker, Abrams and MRAP programs. Weapons systems and munitions production revenues decreased due to lower U.S. Army spending on axles, Hydra-70 rockets, guns and ammunition. Offsetting these decreases, aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased due to additional deliveries of the new G650 and G280 aircraft. Product operating costs were lower in 2013 compared with 2012 . Discrete charges in 2012 are discussed below. Excluding these charges, the decrease in product operating costs was primarily due to lower volume. No other changes were individually significant. Primary changes due to volume: Military vehicle production $ (1,180 ) Weapons systems and munitions production (358 ) Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 864 (674 ) 2012 discrete charges (289 ) Other changes, net 31 Total decrease $ (932 ) The increase in service revenues in 2013 consisted of the following: Ship engineering and repair $ 178 Other, net (60 ) Total increase $ 118 Ship engineering and repair revenues increased in 2013 due to increased submarine overhaul and repair work. Service operating costs were lower in 2013 compared with 2012 due to the intangible asset impairment in 2012 discussed below. Excluding this impairment, service operating costs increased primarily due to higher volume. No other changes were individually significant. Ship engineering and repair volume $ 163 2012 intangible asset impairment (191 ) Other changes, net 4 Total decrease $ (24 ) 34 Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues: Products $ 21,440 $ 19,784 $ (1,656 ) (7.7 )% Services 11,237 11,729 492 4.4 % Operating Costs: Products $ 17,230 $ 16,228 $ (1,002 ) (5.8 )% Services 9,591 10,182 591 6.2 % The decrease in product revenues in 2012 consisted of the following: Mobile communication products $ (1,177 ) European vehicle production (636 ) Ship construction (404 ) Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 791 Other, net (230 ) Total decrease $ (1,656 ) In 2012 , mobile communication products revenues decreased due to slowed defense spending and protracted U.S. customer acquisition cycles. Lower European vehicle production revenues were largely due to several contracts nearing completion and the revenue impact of the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles to the Portuguese government. Ship construction revenues decreased due to the completion of the T-AKE combat-logistics ship program and timing of activity on the Virginia-class submarine program. Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues were higher due to increased deliveries of G650 aircraft. Product operating costs were lower in 2012 compared with 2011 . As shown below, the decrease in product operating costs was primarily due to lower volume. Discrete charges discussed in conjunction with the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology 2012 business groups operating results included $110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business, $89 related to the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles to the Portuguese government, $58 of ruggedized hardware inventory write-downs for products that ceased production in 2012 and $32 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the SV program for the U.K. Ministry of Defence. The 2011 intangible asset impairment in Jet Aviation completions business is discussed in conjunction with the Aerospace business group operating results. No other changes were individually significant. 35 Primary changes due to volume: Mobile communication products $ (850 ) European vehicle production (377 ) Ship construction (422 ) Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting 585 (1,064 ) 2012 discrete charges 289 2011 intangible asset impairment (111 ) Other changes, net (116 ) Total decrease $ (1,002 ) The increase in service revenues in 2012 consisted of the following: Ship engineering and repair $ 358 Mobile communication support 91 Other, net 43 Total increase $ 492 In 2012 , the increase in ship engineering and repair revenues was driven by the acquisition of two East Coast surface-ship repair operations and higher volume on the Ohio-class replacement engineering program. Mobile communication support revenues increased in 2012 primarily due to higher maintenance and long-term support activity on the U.K.-based Bowman communication system program. Service operating costs were higher in 2012 compared with 2011 . As shown below, the increase in service operating costs was primarily due to higher volume. The 2012 intangible asset impairment in Jet Aviation maintenance business is discussed in conjunction with the Aerospace business group operating results. No other changes were individually significant. Primary changes due to volume: Ship engineering and repair $ 298 Mobile communication support 76 374 2012 intangible asset impairment 191 Other changes, net 26 Total increase $ 591 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT In 2012 , we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in the Information Systems and Technology group discussed in conjunction with the business group operating results. G&A EXPENSES As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were 6.2 percent in 2011 , 7.2 percent in 2012 and 6.7 percent in 2013 . G&A expenses in 2012 and 2013 were negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges in our European military vehicles business. We expect G&A expenses in 2014 to be approximately 6.5 percent of revenues. 36 INTEREST, NET Net interest expense was $141 in 2011 , $156 in 2012 and $86 in 2013 . The decrease in interest expense from 2012 results from our debt refinancing completed in December 2012 that lowered the weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt from 3.9 percent to 2.2 percent . See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations. We expect full-year 2014 net interest expense to be approximately $90 . OTHER, NET In 2012 , other expense included a $123 loss on the redemption of debt associated with the refinancing discussed above. In 2011 , other income consisted primarily of a $38 gain from the sale of a business in our Combat Systems group. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, NET Our effective tax rate was 31.4 percent in 2011 , 161.4 percent in 2012 and 31.1 percent in 2013 . The significant increase in 2012 was primarily due to the largely non-deductible goodwill impairment of $2 billion recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group and, to a lesser extent, the establishment of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in our international operations. For further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 30.5 to 31 percent in 2014 . DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In 2013, we recognized a $129 loss, net of taxes, from the settlement of the A-12 litigation with the U.S. Navy. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the A-12 settlement. In 2011 , we recognized a $13 loss, net of taxes, in discontinued operations from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company. We also increased our estimate of the legal costs associated with the A-12 litigation as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in that year that extended the timeline associated with the litigation, resulting in a $13 loss, net of taxes, for a combined loss in discontinued operations of $26 in 2011 . BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE 37 Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $46 billion at the end of 2013 compared with $51.3 billion at year-end 2012 . Our backlog does not include work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. IDIQ contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed. Contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. Contract options in the Aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. On December 31, 2013 , estimated potential contract value associated with IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $27.6 billion , up 3 percent from $26.9 billion at the end of 2012 . We expect to realize this value over the next several years. AEROSPACE Aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace group finished 2013 with a total backlog of $13.9 billion , down from $15.7 billion at year-end 2012 . The group backlog has declined in recent years as we ramped up G650 production to work off the substantial orders we received upon introduction of the aircraft in 2008. Orders were up significantly compared to 2012 and included strong demand across our product portfolio. Estimated potential contract value increased $1.7 billion associated with international orders received in 2013. The group customer base is diverse across customer types and geographic regions. At year-end 2013, private companies and individuals collectively represented approximately 60 percent of the group backlog. Geographically, 65 percent of the group backlog was comprised of international customers on December 31, 2013 . 38 We balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and stabilize delivery levels over time. This has enabled us to maintain an appropriate window between customer order and delivery for our G450 and G550 large-cabin aircraft. We have approximately four years of backlog for the G650. Backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as the time period between customer order and delivery of the G650 aircraft normalizes. At that time, we expect order activity to more closely match deliveries. DEFENSE GROUPS The total backlog in our defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in total backlog only firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding. Total backlog in our defense groups was $32.1 billion on December 31, 2013 , compared with $35.6 billion at the end of 2012 . COMBAT SYSTEMS Combat Systems total backlog was $6.7 billion at the end of 2013 compared with $8.7 billion at year-end 2012 due to delays in international orders and slowed U.S. Army spending. The group backlog on December 31, 2013 , included $1.2 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the Army and U.S. allies around the world. In 2013, the group received awards totaling $435 for all Abrams-related programs. The Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented $1 billion of the group backlog at December 31, 2013 , with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2015. The group received $620 of Stryker orders in 2013, including awards for 96 double-V-hulled vehicles, contractor logistics support and engineering services. The group received a $230 order in 2013 for research, development and testing in preparation for the Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) upgrade program. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: 39 $950 for LAVs for various international customers, including $570 for the upgrade and modernization of approximately 600 LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army; $345 for the design, integration and production of seven prototypes under the U.K. SV program; $320 for Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish Army through 2016; and $190 for the production of additional Eagle vehicles for Germany and Duro vehicles for Switzerland, with an option for 76 additional vehicles. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included $2.2 billion for weapons systems and munitions programs. Combat Systems estimated potential contract value of $3.7 billion increased approximately 30 percent since year-end 2012 primarily due to an IDIQ award for the new Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV). MARINE SYSTEMS The Marine Systems group backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. Backlog has decreased slightly to $16.9 billion at year-end 2013 compared to $17.1 billion at the end of 2012 . The Virginia-class submarine program was the company largest program in 2013 and is the largest contract in the company backlog. The group backlog at year end included $6.9 billion for eight Virginia-class submarines scheduled for delivery through 2018. We received $330 of advanced funding in 2013 for long-lead materials for submarines in the next block of the program and anticipate being awarded a contract for construction in 2014. Navy destroyer programs represented $4.9 billion of the group backlog at year-end 2013. We currently have construction contracts for six DDG-51 destroyers, including four awarded in 2013, scheduled for delivery through 2022. Backlog at year end also includes three ships under the DDG-1000 program scheduled for delivery through 2018 . The Marine Systems group backlog at December 31, 2013 , included $250 for the MLP program. In 2013, the group delivered the first ship in the program, and construction is underway on the remaining two 40 ships, scheduled for delivery in 2014 and 2015. The Navy shipbuilding plan includes procurement of a fourth ship in 2014. The third and fourth ships will be configured as Afloat Forward Staging Bases (AFSB). The year-end backlog also included $1.1 billion for nine Jones Act ships for commercial customers, including contracts for seven ships secured in 2013, scheduled for delivery through 2017. In addition to these construction programs, the Marine Systems group backlog at December 31, 2013 , included approximately $3.7 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services. Design and development efforts on the Ohio-class submarine replacement engineering program totaled $1.7 billion. Year-end backlog for maintenance and repair services totaled $1.2 billion. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards. The Information Systems and Technology group total backlog was $8.5 billion at the end of 2013 compared to $9.8 billion at year-end 2012 . The group backlog does not include approximately $19.1 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2013, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $4.1 billion to the group orders. The group received a number of significant contract awards in 2013 , including the following: $250 from the Army for ruggedized computing equipment under the CHS-4 program. $990 of estimated potential contract value remains under this IDIQ contract. $235 for commercial wireless network systems and support. $160 from Austal USA for combat and seaframe control systems for two Littoral Combat Ships, bringing the value in backlog to $325. Options to provide these naval control systems for four additional ships will be reported in backlog when they are exercised. $145 from the U.S. Department of State to provide supply chain management services. The program has a maximum potential value of $1.2 billion over five years. $140 for production and support of U.S. and U.K. Trident II submarine weapons systems. 41 $135 for the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) program to provide support for the Army live, virtual and constructive training operations. Backlog at year-end 2013 also included the following key programs: $490 of support and modernization work for the intelligence community, the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East and NETCENTS infrastructure programs. $450 for WIN-T and an additional $755 of estimated potential contract value awarded as an IDIQ contract. $315 for contact-center services for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, including the 1-800-MEDICARE program. $190 for the Rifleman and Manpack tactical radios. In 2013, the group received orders from the Army for production of 1,500 radios and 500 accessory kits. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. The $9 billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock and pay dividends. Our net cash, defined as cash and equivalents less debt, was $1.4 billion at year-end 2013 , up $2 billion from the end of 2012 . Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher. On December 31, 2013 , $1.1 billion of our cash was held by international operations. While we do not intend to do so, should this cash be repatriated, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax but would generate offsetting foreign tax credits. Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,238 $ 2,687 $ 3,106 Net cash used by investing activities (1,974 ) (656 ) (367 ) Net cash used by financing activities (1,201 ) (1,382 ) (725 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (27 ) (2 ) (9 ) Net increase in cash and equivalents 36 647 2,005 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 2,613 2,649 3,296 Cash and equivalents at end of year 2,649 3,296 5,301 Marketable securities 248 Short- and long-term debt (3,930 ) (3,909 ) (3,909 ) Net cash (debt) (a) $ (1,033 ) $ (613 ) $ 1,392 Debt-to-equity (b) 29.7 % 34.3 % 27.0 % Debt-to-capital (c) 22.9 % 25.6 % 21.2 % (a) Net cash is calculated as cash and equivalents and marketable securities less debt. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 42 OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2011 , $2.7 billion in 2012 and $3.1 billion in 2013 . In all three years, the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings (loss) after removing the impact of non-cash charges. Operating cash flows in 2013 were favorably impacted by reductions in operating working capital (OWC), primarily in our Marine Systems business group from deposits associated with orders received in 2013 for commercial ships. Cash from operating activities includes contributions to our pension plans, which have grown from $350 in 2011 to $600 in 2013 , with contributions of approximately $550 expected in 2014 . INVESTING ACTIVITIES We used $2 billion in 2011 , $656 in 2012 and $367 in 2013 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash for investing activities were capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $458 in 2011 , $450 in 2012 and $440 in 2013 . We expect capital expenditures of approximately 2 percent of anticipated revenues in 2014 , including ongoing work on Gulfstream Savannah, Georgia, facilities project announced in 2010. Business Acquisitions. We did not complete any acquisitions in 2013 . We completed 13 acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 totaling $2 billion. We used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of acquisition activity. Marketable Securities. We held no marketable securities on December 31, 2013 . In 2012, to bolster liquidity in an uncertain business environment, we received cash of $219 from the net sales and maturity of marketable securities, including $211 from the sale of held-to-maturity securities. Other, Net. Investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of the detection systems business in our Combat Systems group in 2011. FINANCING ACTIVITIES We used $1.2 billion in 2011 , $1.4 billion in 2012 and $725 in 2013 for financing activities. Our primary financing activities included repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and issuances and repayments of debt. Net cash from financing activities also included proceeds received from stock option exercises. Share Repurchases. We repurchased 20 million shares on the open market in 2011 , 9.1 million shares in 2012 and 9.4 million shares in 2013 . As a result, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 5 percent since 2010. On January 24, 2014, we repurcha sed 11.4 million shares of our common stock for $1.2 billi on under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with a financial institution. On February 5, 2014, with shares from the prior authorization exhausted by the ASR program, the board of directors authorized management to repurchase 20 million additional shares of common stock on the open market, approximately 6 percent of our total shares outstanding. Dividends. On March 6, 2013 , our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share the 16 th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the board had increased the quarterly dividend to $0.51 per share in March 2012 and $0.47 per share in March 2011 . We did not pay any dividends in the first three months of 2013 because we made our first quarter 2013 dividend payment in December 2012. Debt Proceeds, Net. In 2011 , we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the proceeds to repay $750 of maturing fixed-rate notes. In 2012 , we issued $2.4 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the proceeds 43 to redeem, prior to maturity, an equal amount of fixed-rate notes with higher interest rates. We have no material repayments of long-term debt scheduled until 2015. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities. We ended 2013 with no commercial paper outstanding. We have $2 billion in bank credit facilities that remain available, including a $1 billion facility expiring in July 2016 and a $1 billion facility expiring in July 2018 . These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to access the capital markets. NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICS We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe these metrics provide useful information, they are not operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other GAAP measures. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,855 $ 2,986 $ 3,238 $ 2,687 $ 3,106 Capital expenditures (385 ) (370 ) (458 ) (450 ) (440 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,470 $ 2,616 $ 2,780 $ 2,237 $ 2,666 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings (loss) from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 119 % 114 % 127 % NM* 125 % Free cash flow from operations 103 % 100 % 109 % NM* 107 % * Not meaningful (NM) due to net loss in 2012. Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital (the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year excluding any change in accumulated other comprehensive loss). Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC is calculated as follows: 44 Year Ended December 31 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations $ 2,407 $ 2,628 $ 2,552 $ (332 ) $ 2,486 After-tax interest expense 117 116 106 109 67 After-tax amortization expense 149 155 163 152 106 Net operating profit (loss) after taxes $ 2,673 $ 2,899 $ 2,821 $ (71 ) $ 2,659 Average invested capital $ 14,870 $ 16,634 $ 17,168 $ 17,223 $ 15,989 Return on invested capital 18.0 % 17.4 % 16.4 % (0.4 )% 16.6 % ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On December 31, 2013 , other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2013 : Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,857 $ 89 $ 1,167 $ 1,028 $ 2,573 Capital lease obligations 34 3 4 4 23 Operating leases 1,096 216 316 191 373 Purchase obligations (b) 17,023 10,027 5,153 1,446 397 Other long-term liabilities (c) 17,334 3,375 2,267 1,691 10,001 $ 40,344 $ 13,710 $ 8,907 $ 4,360 $ 13,367 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of long-term debt. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $11.1 billion of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the current portion of these liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management estimates, which are based largely on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans. See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively 45 those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, and litigation and other contingencies. We employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience and currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We determine progress using either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. An input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion (input measure). For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft, we record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft (output measure). We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. We include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance. These estimates are based on our best judgment at the time. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly, as well as when required by specific events and circumstances. We recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method. Under this method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term. 46 We use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long-term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods. These changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned. Most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch-up method. The impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch-up method. The net increase in our operating earnings (and on a per-share basis) from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled $356 ( $0.63 ) in 2011 , $180 ( $0.33 ) in 2012 and $351 ( $0.65 ) in 2013 . While no revisions on any one contract were material to our Consolidated Financial Statements in 2013 , the amount increased from 2012 largely due to improved performance in the Combat Systems group. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Since 1995, we have acquired more than 65 businesses at a total cost of approximately $23 billion . We have recognized goodwill and intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions. We completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2013. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are consistent with our business groups. For our Aerospace, Combat Systems and Marine Systems reporting units, the estimated fair values were at least double their respective carrying values. The fair value of our Information Systems and Technology reporting unit, for which we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in 2012, exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 15 percent. While the projected cash flows have not changed materially from 2012, the book value of the reporting unit has increased, largely due to improvement in the funded status of the unit defined-benefit retirement plans. The reporting unit remains at risk for a future goodwill impairment should there be further significant increases in the carrying value of the reporting unit or deterioration in the projected cash flows. Uncertainties in future defense spending remain in the current business environment and could impact projected cash flows for the reporting unit. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, 47 where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows. As a result of lower revenues throughout 2013, we reviewed the long-lived assets of our axle business in the Combat Systems group for recoverability. The margin by which the expected cash flows of the business exceeded its carrying value was approximately 10 percent. If future cash flows do not support the recovery of the business assets, we will be required to impair some or all of the long-lived assets, including specifically identified intangible assets of $175. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not allocable currently to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively. 48
