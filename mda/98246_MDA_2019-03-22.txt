Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years which ended on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES The Company's key strategic priorities are to: Amplify an evolved brand message. The Brand is the single most important asset of Tiffany and, indirectly, of the Company. Management intends to increasingly invest in and evolve marketing and public relations programs through a variety of media designed to build awareness of the Brand, its heritage and its products, as well as to enhance the Brand's association with quality and luxury by consumers. Renew the Company's product offerings and enhance in-store presentations. The Company's product development strategy is to accelerate the introduction of new design collections, primarily in jewelry, but also in non-jewelry products, and/or expand certain existing collections annually, all of which are intended to appeal to existing and new customers. To ensure a superior shopping experience, the Company is focused on enhancing the design of its stores, as well as the creative visual presentation of its merchandise, to provide an engaging luxury experience in both its new and existing stores. Deliver an exciting omnichannel customer experience. Management intends to continue to expand and optimize its global store base by evaluating potential markets for new TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as through the renovation, relocation, or closing of existing stores. Management will also continue to pursue opportunities to grow sales through its e-commerce websites and utilize the websites to drive store traffic. In addition, the Company employs highly qualified sales and customer service professionals and is focused on developing effective omnichannel relationships with its customers. Strengthen the Company's competitive position and lead in key markets. The global jewelry industry is competitively fragmented. While the Company enjoys a strong reputation and large customer base, it encounters significant competition in all product categories and geographies. By focusing on enhanced marketing communications, product development and optimization of its store base and digital capabilities, the Company's objective is to be an industry leader in key markets. Cultivate a more efficient operating model. The Company is focused on improving its business operations through new systems, more effective processes and cost restraint, to drive margin growth. This includes realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and other operations, and enhancing its global procurement capabilities. The Company has developed a substantial product supply infrastructure for the procurement and processing of diamonds and the manufacturing of jewelry. This infrastructure is intended to ensure adequate product supply and favorable product costs while adhering to the Company's quality and ethical standards. Inspire an aligned and agile organization to win. The Company's success depends upon its people and their effective execution of the Company's strategic priorities. The Company's management strives to motivate and develop employees with the core competencies and adaptability needed to achieve its objectives. TIFFANY & CO. K- 27 Table of Contents By pursuing these key strategic priorities, management is committed to the following long-term financial objectives: To achieve sustainable sales growth. Management's objective is to generate mid-single-digit percentage worldwide sales increases, primarily through comparable sales growth, as well as through modest store square footage growth. To increase retail productivity and profitability. Management is focused on increasing the frequency of store and website visits and the percentage of store and website visitors who make a purchase, as well as optimal utilization of store square footage, to grow sales and sales per square foot. To achieve improved operating margins, through both improved gross margins and efficient expense management. Management's long-term objective is to improve gross margins, including through controlling product input costs, realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and adjusting retail prices when appropriate. Additionally, management is focused on efficient selling, general and administrative expense management, thereby generating sales leverage on fixed costs. These efforts are collectively intended to generate a higher rate of operating earnings growth relative to sales growth, and management targets an improvement in operating margin of 50 basis points per year over the long term. To improve inventory and other asset productivity and cash flow. Management's long-term objective is to maintain inventory growth at a rate less than sales growth, with greater focus on efficiencies in product sourcing and manufacturing as well as optimizing store inventory levels, all of which is intended to contribute to improvements in cash flow and return on assets. To maintain a capital structure that provides financial strength and the ability to invest in strategic initiatives, while also allowing for the return of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 2018 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 7% to $4.4 billion , reflecting sales growth in all reportable segments. Comparable sales increased 4% from the prior year. On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), worldwide net sales increased 6% and comparable sales increased 4%. The Company added a net of six TIFFANY & CO. stores (opening four in Asia-Pacific, two in the Americas two in Europe, one in Japan and one in the Emerging Markets, while closing two in the Americas, one in Asia-Pacific and one in Europe) which resulted in a 1% net increase in gross retail square footage. In addition, the Company relocated 10 existing stores. The Company introduced its Tiffany Paper Flowers jewelry collection and Tiffany True engagement rings and expanded existing collections. Earnings from operations decreased $19.1 million, or 2% in 2018 compared to the prior year. Earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales ("operating margin") decreased 160 basis points, due to an increase in gross margin which was more than offset by a higher Selling, general, and administrative expense ratio, which included increased marketing and other strategic investment spending which management believes are necessary to support long-term sales growth. The Company's effective income tax rate decreased to 21.1% in 2018 from 51.3%, or 32.1% on an adjusted basis in 2017 (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). Net earnings increased to $586.4 million , or $4.75 per diluted share, in 2018 from $370.1 million, or $2.96 per diluted share, in 2017. Net earnings in 2017 included a net charge of $146.2 million, or $1.17 TIFFANY & CO. K- 28 Table of Contents per diluted share, related to the enactment of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act"). Excluding that net charge, net earnings were $516.3 million, or $4.13 per diluted share, in 2017 (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). Inventories, net increased 8% to $2.4 billion . Cash flow from operating activities was $531.8 million in 2018 , compared with $932.2 million in 2017 . Free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures") was $249.7 million in 2018 , compared with $692.9 million in 2017 . The Company returned capital to shareholders by paying regular quarterly dividends (which were increased 10% effective July 2018 to $0.55 per share, or an annualized rate of $2.20 per share) and by repurchasing 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $421.4 million . RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). Internally, management also monitors and measures its performance using certain sales and earnings measures that include or exclude amounts, or are subject to adjustments that have the effect of including or excluding amounts, from the most directly comparable GAAP measure ("non-GAAP financial measures"). The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with useful supplemental information that will allow them to evaluate the Company's operating results using the same measures that management uses to monitor and measure its performance. The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. TIFFANY & CO. K- 29 Table of Contents Net Sales . The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis are calculated by taking the current year's sales in local currencies and translating them into U.S. dollars using the prior year's foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of sales performance and of comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year. 2018 2017 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 7 % 1 % 6 % 4 % % 4 % Americas 5 5 2 1 1 Asia-Pacific 13 13 10 2 8 Japan 8 2 6 (1 ) (2 ) 1 Europe 3 1 2 6 3 3 Other (20 ) (20 ) 26 26 Comparable Sales: Worldwide 4 % % 4 % % % % Americas 5 5 1 1 Asia-Pacific 5 5 (1 ) 1 (2 ) Japan 7 2 5 (1 ) (3 ) 2 Europe (2 ) 1 (3 ) 2 (2 ) Other (15 ) (15 ) 2 2 TIFFANY & CO. K- 30 Table of Contents Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company revised its definition of comparable sales (see "Comparable Sales" below) to include e-commerce and catalog sales, in addition to sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months. For reference purposes, the following table reconciles the comparable sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year for 2017: 2017 As Previously Reported GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Comparable Sales: Worldwide % % % Americas 1 1 Asia-Pacific (1 ) 1 (2 ) Japan (1 ) (3 ) 2 Europe (2 ) 2 (4 ) Other 2 2 Statements of Earnings. Internally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain items listed below. Management believes excluding such items provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of the Company's results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. The following tables reconcile certain GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts: (in millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Charges related to the 2017 Tax Act a Non-GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 390.4 $ (146.2 ) $ 244.2 Effective income tax rate 51.3 % (19.2 )% 32.1 % Net earnings 370.1 146.2 516.3 Diluted earnings per share* 2.96 1.17 4.13 a Net expense recognized in 2017 related to the estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act.

Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. Free cash flow is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. The ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary purposes after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a useful supplemental basis for assessing the Company's operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow: ( in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities a $ 531.8 $ 932.2 $ 705.7 Less: Capital expenditures a (282.1 ) (239.3 ) (222.8 ) Free cash flow $ 249.7 $ 692.9 $ 482.9 a See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further information on the Company's cash flows. Comparable Sales Comparable sales include sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months. Sales from e-commerce sites are included in comparable sales for those sites that have been operating for more than 12 months. Sales for relocated stores are included in comparable sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable sales base. Net Sales The Company generates sales through its retail, Internet, wholesale, business-to-business and catalog channels (see "Item 1. Business - Reportable Segments"). Net sales by segment were as follows: (in millions) 2018 % of Total Net Sales 2017 % of Total Net Sales 2016 % of Total Net Sales 2018 vs 2017 % Change in Net Sales 2017 vs 2016 % Change in Net Sales Americas $ 1,960.3 44 % $ 1,870.9 45 % $ 1,841.9 46 % 5 % 2 % Asia-Pacific 1,239.0 28 1,095.0 26 999.1 25 13 10 Japan 643.0 15 596.3 14 604.4 15 8 (1 ) Europe 504.4 11 489.0 12 462.5 12 3 6 Other 95.4 2 118.6 3 93.9 2 (20 ) 26 $ 4,442.1 $ 4,169.8 $ 4,001.8 7 % 4 % TIFFANY & CO.

In 2018 , the Company increased gross retail square footage by 1%, net, through store openings, closings and relocations. The Company opened 10 stores and closed four: opening four in Asia-Pacific (three in China and one in Thailand), two in the Americas (one each in the U.S. and Latin America), two in Europe (one each in Germany and Denmark), one in Japan and one in the Emerging Markets, while closing two stores in the Americas (in the U.S.), one store in Asia-Pacific (in China) and one store in Europe (in Italy). In addition, the Company relocated 10 existing stores. In 2017 , the Company increased gross retail square footage by 3%, net, through store openings, closings and relocations. The Company opened nine stores and closed seven: opening five in Asia-Pacific (two in China, two in TIFFANY & CO. K- 35 Table of Contents Australia and one in Korea), three in Europe (one each in Italy, Russia and the U.K.) and one in the Americas (in the U.S.) while closing three stores in Asia-Pacific (one each in China, Korea and Taiwan), two stores in the Americas (in the U.S.) and one each in Japan and the Emerging Markets. In addition, the Company relocated seven existing stores. Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $2,800 in 2018 , $2,700 in 2017 and $2,700 in 2016 . Excluded from the store counts and sales per gross square foot amounts above are pop-up stores (stores with lease terms of 24 months or less). Gross Margin (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Gross profit $ 2,811.0 $ 2,610.7 $ 2,499.0 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 63.3 % 62.6 % 62.4 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased 70 basis points in 2018 , largely reflecting favorable product input costs, a decrease in wholesale sales of diamonds and sales leverage on fixed costs, partially offset by the impact of an $8.5 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2018 related to the bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner to which the Company entrusted precious scrap metal. Gross margin increased 20 basis points in 2017 due to favorable product input costs, partly offset by the dilutive effects from increases in wholesale sales and in wholesale sales of diamonds, as well as increases in certain product-related costs, including inventory reserves and distribution and logistics. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product input cost increases, specific market conditions and changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Its long-term strategy is to continue that approach, although significant increases in product input costs or weakening foreign currencies can affect gross margin negatively over the short-term until management makes necessary price adjustments. Among the market conditions that management considers are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence and competitive pricing conditions. Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note H. Hedging Instruments"). Management increased retail prices in both 2018 and 2017 across most geographic regions and product categories, some of which were intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 As reported: SG&A expenses $ 2,020.7 $ 1,801.3 $ 1,752.6 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales ("SG&A expense ratio") 45.5 % 43.2 % 43.8 % Excluding other operating expenses*: SG&A expenses $ 1,714.6 SG&A expense ratio 42.8 % *See "Non-GAAP Measures" above for a description of such excluded operating expenses. SG&A expenses increased $219.4 million , or 12% , in 2018 , largely reflecting marketing and other strategic investment spending (that began in the second quarter of 2018), increased labor and incentive compensation costs and store occupancy and depreciation expenses. There was no significant effect on SG&A expense changes from foreign currency translation. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 230 basis points compared to 2017, which included the impact of increased marketing and other strategic investment spending, which TIFFANY & CO. K- 36 Table of Contents management believes are necessary to support long-term sales growth. Management intends to maintain such spending at these higher levels for the foreseeable future. SG&A expenses increased $48.7 million , or 3% , in 2017. Excluding the 2016 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures," SG&A expenses in 2017 increased $86.7 million, or 5% compared to 2016, largely reflecting increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses and labor and incentive compensation costs. There was no significant effect on SG&A expense changes from foreign currency translation. The Company's SG&A expenses are largely fixed or controllable in nature (including, but not limited to, marketing costs, employees' salaries and benefits, fixed store rent and depreciation expenses), with the total of such costs representing approximately 80 - 85% of total SG&A expenses, and the remainder comprised of variable items (including, but not limited to, variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies). Earnings from Operations (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 As reported: Earnings from operations $ 790.3 $ 809.4 $ 746.4 Operating margin 17.8 % 19.4 % 18.7 % Excluding other operating expenses*: Earnings from operations $ 784.4 Operating margin 19.6 % *See "Non-GAAP Measures" above for a description of such excluded operating expenses. Earnings from operations decreased $19.1 million, or 2% in 2018 and operating margin decreased 160 basis points, reflecting an increase in gross margin, which was more than offset by a higher SG&A expense ratio. Earnings from operations increased $63.0 million, or 8% in 2017 and operating margin increased 70 basis points, which reflected impairment charges recorded in 2016 (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). When excluding such charges, the decrease in operating margin in 2017 resulted from a higher SG&A expense ratio, partly offset by a higher gross margin. TIFFANY & CO.

On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in 2018 compared with 2017 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 160 basis points due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased marketing and other strategic investment spending and sales deleverage on operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 120 basis points due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased marketing and other strategic investment spending, partly offset by an increase in gross margin; Japan the ratio increased 180 basis points due to an increase in gross margin (which included the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on inventory purchases), as well as the impact of sales leverage on operating expenses; and Europe the ratio decreased 140 basis points due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased marketing and other strategic investment spending, partly offset by an increase in gross margin. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in 2017 compared with 2016 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 20 basis points due to an improvement in gross margin, partly offset by sales deleverage on operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 40 basis points due to sales leverage on operating expenses, partly offset by a decrease in gross margin, both attributable to increased wholesale sales in the region; Japan the ratio increased 70 basis points due to an increase in gross margin (which included the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on inventory purchases), partly offset by sales deleverage on operating expenses; and Europe the ratio decreased 10 basis points due to sales deleverage on operating expenses, partly offset by an increase in gross margin. TIFFANY & CO. K- 38 Table of Contents Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $44.3 million in 2018 due to (i) increased costs associated with upgrades to the Company's information technology systems, (ii) an $8.5 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2018 related to the bankruptcy filing of a metals refiner to which the Company entrusted precious scrap metal, and (iii) increased incentive compensation expense. Such expenses increased $20.7 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in charitable donations to the Tiffany & Co. Foundation, a private foundation organized to support 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, increased costs associated with upgrades to the Company's information technology systems and higher severance costs associated with changes in corporate management. Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs decreased $2.3 million , or 5% , in 2018 and $4.0 million , or 9% , in 2017 . Other Expense, Net Other expense, net includes the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, interest income and gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net was $7.1 million in 2018, $6.9 million in 2017 and $23.8 million in 2016. The $16.9 million decrease in Other expense, net in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost and due to increases in gains on sales of marketable securities and interest income. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 21.1% in 2018, compared with 51.3% in 2017 and 34.1% in 2016. The effective income tax rate in 2017 reflected the impact of a $146.2 million net charge, or $1.17 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017. Excluding this net charge, the effective income tax rate was 32.1% in 2017 (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). The effective income tax rate in 2018 of 21.1% benefited from the favorable impact of the 2017 Tax Act, including the reduction of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to 21% and the introduction of the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction. In addition, the effective income tax rate in 2018 was decreased by 210 basis points due to benefits of $15.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, recorded in 2018 to adjust charges related to the 2017 Tax Act that were recorded in 2017 and are described below. The effective income tax rate in 2017 of 51.3% differed from the effective income tax rate in 2016 of 34.1% primarily due to the $146.2 million net charge referenced above. The effective income tax rate in 2017 also differed from 2016 as a result of an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction, the implementation of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits and/or shortfalls related to exercises and vesting of share-based compensation to be recorded in the provision for income taxes rather than in additional paid in capital and lower state taxes, partially offset by the impact of a change in uncertain tax positions primarily attributable to the conclusion of a tax examination during the first quarter of 2016. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. This enactment resulted in a number of significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law for U.S. taxpayers. On the same date, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which addressed the application of U.S. GAAP in situations in which a registrant did not have necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. Changes in tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the Company's 2017 consolidated financial statements reflected the estimated immediate tax effect of the 2017 Tax Act. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note N. Income Taxes" for additional information on the provisions and impacts of the 2017 Tax Act and SAB 118. The net charge of $146.2 million recognized in 2017 related to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act consisted of: Estimated tax expense of $94.8 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the impact of the reduction in the U.S. statutory income tax rate on the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities, TIFFANY & CO. K- 39 Table of Contents Estimated tax expense of $56.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the one-time transition tax effected via a mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits ("Transition Tax"), and A tax benefit of $4.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, resulting from the effect of the 21% statutory income tax rate for the month of January 2018 on the Company annual statutory income tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2018. Because the Company fiscal year ended on January 31, 2018, the Company statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33.8%, rather than 35.0%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic priorities. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally generated cash flows, the funds available under its revolving credit facilities and the ability to access the debt and capital markets are sufficient to support the Company's liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. At January 31, 2019 , the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $792.6 million , of which approximately 25% was held in locations outside the U.S. where the Company has determined to maintain its assertion to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings to support its continued expansion and investments in such foreign locations. To the extent the Company were to repatriate such funds, it may incur withholding taxes, state income taxes and the tax expense or benefit associated with foreign currency gains or losses. The Company believes it has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate those funds held outside the U.S. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note N. Income Taxes" for additional information. In addition, the Company had Short-term investments of $62.7 million at January 31, 2019. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 531.8 $ 932.2 $ 705.7 Investing activities (29.9 ) (481.1 ) (236.8 ) Financing activities (674.3 ) (421.1 ) (386.4 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5.7 ) 12.7 1.9 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (178.1 ) $ 42.7 $ 84.4 Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $531.8 million in 2018 , $932.2 million in 2017 and $705.7 million in 2016 . The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflected increases in inventory purchases and cash payments for income taxes. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected more effective management and timing of payables and reduced payments for income taxes, partly offset by increased inventory purchases. Additionally, the Company made a $120.0 million voluntary contribution to its U.S. pension plan in 2016. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) decreased to $3.0 billion at January 31, 2019 from $3.3 billion at January 31, 2018 . Accounts receivable, net at January 31, 2019 were 6% higher than at January 31, 2018 . Inventories, net at January 31, 2019 were 8% higher than at January 31, 2018 , which primarily reflected an increase in finished goods inventories. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing Inventories, net by 3% from January 31, 2018 . TIFFANY & CO. K- 40 Table of Contents Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at January 31, 2019 were 17% higher than at January 31, 2018 , partly reflecting the receipt of an advance payment of $31.1 million during 2018 related to the previous acquisition of the premises containing one of the Company's leased retail stores and an administrative office under compulsory acquisition laws in Australia (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note J. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information). Investing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from investing activities of $29.9 million in 2018 , $481.1 million in 2017 and $236.8 million in 2016 . The decrease in net cash outflows in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by net cash flows resulting from purchases and sales of marketable securities and short-term investments. The increase in net cash outflows in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by increased net purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had $240.0 million of net sales of marketable securities and short-term investments during 2018 , compared with net purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments of $246.6 million in 2017 and $15.7 million in 2016. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores (which represented approximately 60% of capital expenditures in 2018, 2017 and 2016), as well as distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in information technology. Capital expenditures were $282.1 million in 2018 , $239.3 million in 2017 and $222.8 million in 2016 , representing 6% of worldwide net sales in each year. The Company currently anticipates capital expenditures to be 7 - 9% of worldwide net sales during the fiscal years 2019 through 2021, which includes the expected expenditures for the renovation of its New York Flagship store. Additionally, the renovation of the New York Flagship store is expected to lower diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.10 - $0.15 in fiscal years 2019 through 2021 due to accelerated depreciation charges related to the existing store, preliminary development costs and the incremental costs associated with renting and fitting out the adjacent space that will be utilized to minimize disruptions during the renovation period. Following the completion of this renovation project, the Company currently anticipates capital expenditures returning to historical levels as a percentage of worldwide net sales. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $674.3 million in 2018 , $421.1 million in 2017 and $386.4 million in 2016 . TIFFANY & CO. K- 41 Table of Contents Borrowings. The Company had net (repayments of) proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Short-term borrowings: (Repayments of) proceeds from credit facility borrowings, net $ (18.4 ) $ (67.8 ) $ 14.2 Proceeds from other credit facility borrowings 49.3 39.2 76.8 Repayments of other credit facility borrowings (32.0 ) (96.1 ) (83.1 ) Net (repayments of) proceeds from short-term borrowings (1.1 ) (124.7 ) 7.9 Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt 98.1 Repayment of long-term debt (97.1 ) Net proceeds from long-term borrowings 1.0 Net (repayments of) proceeds from total borrowings $ (1.1 ) $ (124.7 ) $ 8.9 Credit Facilities. On October 25, 2018, the Registrant, along with certain of its subsidiaries designated as borrowers thereunder, entered into a five-year multi-bank, multi-currency committed unsecured revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit subfacility, consisting of basic commitments in an amount up to $750.0 million (which commitments may be increased, subject to certain conditions and limitations, at the request of the Registrant) (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility replaced the Registrant previously existing $375.0 million four-year unsecured revolving credit facility and $375.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which were each terminated and repaid in connection with the Registrant entry into the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility matures in 2023, provided that such maturity may be extended for one or two additional one-year periods at any time with the consent of the applicable lenders, as further described in the agreement governing such facility. Commercial Paper . In August 2017, the Registrant and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries established a commercial paper program (the "Commercial Paper Program") for the issuance of commercial paper in the form of short-term promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $750.0 million. Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program may be used for general corporate purposes. The aggregate amount of borrowings that the Company is currently authorized to have outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Registrant's Credit Facility is $750.0 million. The Registrant guarantees the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary under the Commercial Paper Program. Maturities of commercial paper notes may vary, but cannot exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. Notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally with the Registrant's present and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Other Credit Facilities. In 2016, the Registrant's wholly owned subsidiary, Tiffany & Co. (Shanghai) Commercial Company Limited, entered into a three-year multi-bank revolving credit agreement (the "Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement"). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement has an aggregate borrowing limit of RMB 990.0 million ( $147.4 million at January 31, 2019 ) and matures in July 2019. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings outstanding under all the Company's credit facilities was 3.69% at January 31, 2019 and 4.35% at January 31, 2018 . Senior Notes. In August 2016, the Registrant issued 10.0 billion ( $91.8 million at January 31, 2019 ) of 0.78% Senior Notes due August 2026 (the "Yen Notes") in a private transaction. The Yen Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.78% per annum, payable semi-annually on February 26 and August 26 of each year, commencing February 26, 2017. The proceeds from the issuance of the Yen Notes were used to repay the Registrant's 10.0 billion 1.72% Senior Notes due September 2016 upon the maturity thereof. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings and long-term debt) to stockholders' equity was 32% at January 31, 2019 and 31% at January 31, 2018 . TIFFANY & CO. K- 42 Table of Contents At January 31, 2019 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. For additional information regarding all of the Company's credit facilities, senior note issuances and other outstanding indebtedness, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G. Debt." In May 2018, the Registrant's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (the "2018 Program"). The 2018 Program, which became effective June 1, 2018 and expires on January 31, 2022, authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its Common Stock through open market transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans and one or more accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") or other structured repurchase transactions, and/or privately negotiated transactions. Purchases under this program are discretionary and will be made from time to time based on market conditions and the Company's liquidity needs. The Company may fund repurchases under the 2018 Program from existing cash at such time or from proceeds of any existing borrowing facilities at such time and/or the issuance of new debt. The 2018 Program replaced the Company's previous share repurchase program approved in January 2016 (the "2016 Program"), under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its Common Stock. At the time of termination, $154.9 million remained available for repurchase under the 2016 Program. As of January 31, 2019, $635.0 million remained available under the 2018 Program. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into ASR agreements with two third-party financial institutions to repurchase an aggregate of $250.0 million of its Common Stock. The ASR agreements were entered into under the 2018 Program. Pursuant to the ASR agreements, the Company made an aggregate payment of $250.0 million from available cash on hand in exchange for an initial delivery of 1,529,286 shares of its Common Stock. Final settlement of the ASR agreements was completed in July 2018, pursuant to which the Company received an additional 353,112 shares of its Common Stock. In total, 1,882,398 shares of the Company's Common Stock were repurchased under these ASR agreements at an average cost per share of $132.81 over the term of the agreements. The Company's share repurchase activity was as follows: (in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2016 Cost of repurchases $ 421.4 $ 99.2 $ 183.6 Shares repurchased and retired 3.5 1.0 2.8 Average cost per share $ 121.28 $ 94.86 $ 65.24 Proceeds from exercised stock options. The Company's proceeds from exercised stock options were $23.1 million , $54.6 million and $15.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock was increased once in each of 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $2.15 , $1.95 and $1.75 per common share in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, with cash dividends paid of $263.8 million , $242.6 million and $218.8 million in those respective years. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 45% , 66% and 49% in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Dividends as a percentage of adjusted net earnings (see "Non-GAAP Measures") were 47% in 2017 and 2016. At least annually, the Company's Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Financing Arrangements with Diamond Mining and Exploration Companies The Company previously provided financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the output from mines owned by these companies. The Company recorded impairment charges totaling $12.6 million during 2016 related to such loans receivable from two diamond mining and exploration companies (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ). TIFFANY & CO. K- 43 Table of Contents Information Systems Assessment The Company is engaged in a multi-year program to upgrade and/or replace certain of its information systems. As part of this program, the Company concluded that the development of a previous system originally intended to deliver enhanced finished goods inventory management and merchandising capabilities would instead be delivered through further development of the Company Enterprise Resource Planning system and the continued implementation of a new order management system. Accordingly, the Company evaluated the costs capitalized in connection with the development of the previous system for impairment in accordance with its policy on the review of long-lived assets (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note E. Property, Plant and Equipment") and recorded a related pre-tax impairment charge of $25.4 million within SG&A during 2016. The multi-year program is ongoing and, as previously disclosed, may require significant capital expenditures and dedication of resources in both current and future periods. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2019 : (in millions) Total 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases a $ 1,507.0 $ 292.8 $ 452.0 $ 324.2 $ 438.0 Inventory purchase obligations b 283.9 283.9 Interest on debt c 592.8 35.9 71.8 68.6 416.5 Other contractual obligations d 113.8 72.1 21.7 2.7 17.3 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 113.4 113.4 Long-term debt e 891.8 50.0 841.8 $ 3,502.7 $ 798.1 $ 545.5 $ 445.5 $ 1,713.6 a) Operating lease obligations do not include obligations for contingent rent, property taxes, insurance and maintenance that are required by most lease agreements. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J. Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of the Company's operating leases. b) The Company will, from time to time, enter into arrangements to purchase rough diamonds that contain minimum purchase obligations. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated at approximately $60.0 million for 2019 and are included in this table. Purchases beyond 2019 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. c) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company's working capital needs. d) Consists primarily of technology licensing and service contracts, fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies; also includes the remaining Transition Tax liability. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note N. Income Taxes" for additional information. e) Amounts exclude any unamortized discount or premium. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company's pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company funds its U.S. pension plan's trust in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current service and for the unfunded benefit obligation over a reasonable period and for current service benefit accruals. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the Qualified Plan, the Company may elect not to make any contribution in a particular year. No cash contribution was required in 2018 and none is required in 2019 to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. However, the Company periodically evaluates whether to make discretionary cash contributions to the Qualified Plan and made voluntary cash contributions of $11.8 million in 2018 , $15.0 million in 2017 and $120.0 million in 2016. The Company also made such a contribution of $30.0 million TIFFANY & CO. K- 44 Table of Contents in March 2019 . The Company does not currently expect to make any additional contributions in 2019. This expectation is subject to change based on management's assessment of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, asset performance, interest rates and changes in actuarial assumptions. Unrecognized tax benefits of $17.3 million and accrued interest and penalties of $4.2 million at January 31, 2019 . The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the examinations may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. The following is a summary of the Company's outstanding borrowings and available capacity under its credit facilities at January 31, 2019 : (in millions) Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Letters of Credit Issued Available Capacity Five-year revolving credit facility a, b $ 750.0 $ 13.5 $ 6.1 $ 730.4 Other credit facilities c 283.0 99.9 183.1 $ 1,033.0 $ 113.4 $ 6.1 $ 913.5 a) Matures in 2023. b) The aggregate amount of borrowings that the Company is currently authorized to have outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility is $750.0 million. As of January 31, 2019 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. c) Maturities through 2019. In addition, the Company has other available letters of credit and financial guarantees of $77.7 million, of which $28.3 million was outstanding at January 31, 2019 . Of those available letters of credit and financial guarantees, $64.1 million expires within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company's business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing approximately one-third of annual net sales and a higher percentage of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its net realizable value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2019 , a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $8.1 million in inventory and cost of sales. TIFFANY & CO. K- 45 Table of Contents Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and key money . The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and key money for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company did not record any significant impairment charges in 2018. In 2017, the Company recorded aggregate impairment charges of $10.0 million related to property, plant and equipment. In 2016, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $25.4 million associated with software costs capitalized in connection with the development of a finished goods inventory management and merchandising information system (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note E. Property, Plant and Equipment" for additional information). Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. A qualitative assessment is first performed for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, an evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2018 , 2017 and 2016 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Significant judgments, interpretations and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense. The Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ("tax filing positions"). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more likely-than-not recognition threshold for tax benefits related to the income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. At January 31, 2019, total unrecognized tax benefits were $17.3 million. Management anticipates that it is reasonably possible that the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $6.0 million in the next 12 months; however management does not currently anticipate a corresponding impact on net earnings. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. In evaluating the Company's likelihood to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Following the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017, the SEC issued SAB 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant did not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. Specifically, SAB 118 provided a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period began in the reporting period that included the enactment date and ended when an entity obtained, prepared and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, but could not exceed one year. The Company adopted the provisions of SAB 118 with respect to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on its 2017 consolidated financial statements. Consistent with SAB 118, the Company calculated and recorded reasonable estimates in its 2017 consolidated financial statements for the impact of the Transition Tax and the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The Company also adopted the provisions of SAB 118 as it related to the assertion of the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings and profits. The charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the Transition Tax and the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax TIFFANY & CO. K- 46 Table of Contents liabilities, as a result of applying the 2017 Tax Act, represented provisional amounts for which the Company's analysis was incomplete but reasonable estimates could be determined. Further, the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on the Company's assertion to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings and profits was incomplete, as the Company continued to analyze the relevant provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and related accounting guidance. During 2018, as permitted by SAB 118, the Company completed its analyses under the 2017 Tax Act, including those related to: (i) the provisional estimate recorded during 2017 for the Transition Tax; (ii) the provisional estimate recorded during 2017 to remeasure the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities; and (iii) the Company's assertion to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings and profits. As a result of completing these analyses, during 2018, the Company: (i) recorded tax benefits totaling $12.6 million to adjust the provisional estimate recorded in 2017 to remeasure the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities; (ii) recorded tax benefits totaling $3.3 million to adjust the provisional estimate recorded in 2017 for the Transition Tax; and (iii) determined to maintain its assertion to indefinitely reinvest undistributed foreign earnings and profits.

The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans and provides certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected healthcare costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used a discount rate of 4.0% to determine 2018 expense for its U.S. Qualified Plan and its postretirement plans and 3.75% for its Excess Plan/SRIP. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rates would have decreased 2018 pension and postretirement expenses by $6.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rates would have increased the 2018 pension and postretirement expenses by $6.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.00% to determine its 2018 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2018 pension expense by $2.4 million. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan's current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 6.75% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care was assumed for 2018. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2023 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the year ended January 31, 2019 or aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2018 postretirement expense. 2019 Outlook Management's guidance for fiscal 2019 includes: (i) worldwide net sales increasing by a low-single-digit percentage over the prior year as reported (and slightly higher on a constant-exchange-rate basis); (ii) net earnings per diluted share increasing by a mid-single-digit percentage; and (iii) an expected decline in net earnings per diluted share in the first half of the year, reflecting sales pressures (from the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower foreign tourist spending and comparisons to strong growth in last year's first half) as well as expenses related to higher strategic investment spending that began in the second quarter of 2018, among other factors. These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company's plans and assumptions for the full year, including: (i) a low-single-digit increase in comparable sales, with varying results across the regions; (ii) worldwide gross retail square footage increasing 3%, net through eight store openings, six closings and 15 relocations; (iii) operating margin slightly above the prior year; (iv) interest and other expenses, net slightly lower than the prior year; (v) an effective income tax rate TIFFANY & CO. K- 47 Table of Contents of approximately 23%; (vi) a stronger U.S. dollar on a year-over-year basis; and (vii) a modest effect on EPS from share repurchases. Management also expects: (i) net cash provided by operating activities of at least $750 million and (ii) free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures") of at least $400 million. These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company's plans and assumptions for the full year, including: (i) minimal growth in net inventories for the full year, (ii) capital expenditures of $350 million and (iii) net earnings in line with management's expectations, as described above.
