C ONTENTS OF MD&A MD&A consists of the following information: Forward-Looking Statements Accounting Matters Dominion Results of Operations Segment Results of Operations Virginia Power Results of Operations Segment Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Future Issues and Other Matters F ORWARD -L OOKING S TATEMENTS This report contains statements concerning Dominion and Virginia Power expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In most cases, the reader can identify these forward-looking statements by such words as anticipate, estimate, forecast, expect, believe, should, could, plan, may, continue, target or other similar words. Dominion and Virginia Power make forward-looking statements with full knowledge that risks and uncertainties exist that may cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. Factors that may cause actual results to differ are often presented with the forward-looking statements themselves. Additionally, other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement. These factors include but are not limited to: Unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; Extreme weather events, including hurricanes, high winds and severe storms, that can cause outages and property damage to facilities; Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory developments; Changes to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, the tightening of emission or discharge limits for GHGs and other emissions, more extensive permitting requirements and the regulation of additional substances; Cost of environmental compliance, including those costs related to climate change; Risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities; Unplanned outages of the Companies facilities; Fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices and the effect these could have on Dominion earnings and Dominion and Virginia Power liquidity position and the underlying value of their assets; Counterparty credit and performance risk; Capital market conditions, including the availability of credit and the ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms; Risks associated with Virginia Power membership and participation in PJM related to obligations created by the default of other participants; Price risk due to investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts by Dominion and Virginia Power and in benefit plan trusts by Dominion; Fluctuations in interest rates; Changes in federal and state tax laws and regulations; Changes in rating agency requirements or credit ratings and their effect on availability and cost of capital; Changes in financial or regulatory accounting principles or policies imposed by governing bodies; Employee workforce factors including collective bargaining agreements and labor negotiations with union employees; The risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures; Receipt of approvals for and timing of closing dates for acquisitions and divestitures; Changes in rules for RTOs and ISOs in which Dominion and Virginia Power participate, including changes in rate designs and new and evolving capacity models; Political and economic conditions, including the threat of domestic terrorism, inflation and deflation; Industrial, commercial and residential growth or decline in the Companies service areas and changes in customer growth or usage patterns, including as a result of energy conservation programs; Additional competition in electric markets in which Dominion merchant generation facilities operate; Changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation and smart grid technologies; Changes to regulated electric rates collected by Virginia Power and regulated gas distribution, transportation and storage rates, including LNG storage, collected by Dominion; Timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned construction or expansion projects; The inability to complete planned construction projects within the terms and time frames initially anticipated; and Adverse outcomes in litigation matters. Additionally, other risks that could cause actual results to differ from predicted results are set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. A CCOUNTING M ATTERS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Dominion and Virginia Power have identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to their financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. Dominion and Virginia Power have discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the Audit Committee of their Board of Directors. Virginia Power Board of Directors also serves as its Audit Committee. 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued A CCOUNTING FOR R EGULATED O PERATIONS The accounting for Virginia Power regulated electric and Dominion regulated gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that they are required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in their Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs are deferred as regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. Generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator. The Companies evaluate whether or not recovery of their regulatory assets through future rates is probable and make various assumptions in their analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. The Companies currently believe the recovery of their regulatory assets is probable. See Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A SSET R ETIREMENT O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, the Companies estimate the fair value of their AROs using present value techniques, in which they make various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. AROs currently reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were measured during a period of historically low interest rates. The impact on measurements of new AROs or remeasurements of existing AROs, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. When the Companies revise any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing AROs, they adjust the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long-lived asset. The Companies accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Dominion recognized $85 million, $89 million and $94 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $81 million in 2011. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Virginia Power recognized $35 million, $35 million and $38 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $37 million in 2011. Virginia Power records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning AROs as an adjustment to its regulatory liability for nuclear decommissioning. A significant portion of the Companies AROs relates to the future decommissioning of Dominion merchant and Virginia Power utility nuclear facilities. These nuclear decommissioning AROs are reported in the Dominion Generation segment. At December 31, 2010, Dominion nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $1.4 billion, representing approximately 87% of its total AROs. At December 31, 2010, Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning AROs totaled $620 million, representing approximately 92% of its total AROs. Based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of AROs relates to those associated with the Companies nuclear decommissioning obligations. The Companies obtain from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for their nuclear plants. These cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, the Companies cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. The selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be a critical assumption. The Companies determine cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. As a result of the updated decommissioning cost studies and applicable escalation rates obtained in 2009, Dominion recorded a decrease of $309 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs of its units, including a $103 million ($62 million after-tax) reduction in other operations and maintenance expense due to a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service. Virginia Power recorded a decrease of $119 million in the nuclear decommissioning AROs for its units. I NCOME T AXES Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. Given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. At December 31, 2010, Dominion had $307 million and Virginia Power had $117 million of unrecognized tax benefits. For a substantial amount of these unrecognized tax benefits, the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Dominion and Virginia Power evaluate quar- 34 Table of Contents terly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. The Companies establish a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2010, Dominion had established $68 million of valuation allowances and Virginia Power had no valuation allowances. A CCOUNTING FOR D ERIVATIVE C ONTRACTS AND O THER I NSTRUMENTS AT F AIR V ALUE Dominion and Virginia Power use derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs to manage commodity and financial market risks of their business operations. Derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. The majority of investments held in Dominion and Virginia Power nuclear decommissioning and Dominion rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 7 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these fair value measurements. Fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. In the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. When evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, the Companies consider whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. If pricing information from external sources is not available, or if the Companies believe that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. In those cases the Companies must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect their market assumptions. The Companies maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. U SE OF E STIMATES IN G OODWILL I MPAIRMENT T ESTING As of December 31, 2010, Dominion reported $3.1 billion of goodwill in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former CNG in 2000. In April of each year, Dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The 2010, 2009 and 2008 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment. In general, Dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. For Dominion Appalachian E&P operations, Peoples and Hope and certain DCI operations, negotiated sales prices were used as fair value for the tests conducted in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as Dominion estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. These underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in Dominion estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. Although Dominion has consistently applied the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. If the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. U SE OF E STIMATES IN L ONG - LIVED A SSET I MPAIRMENT T ESTING Impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When an asset carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset fair value is less than its carrying amount. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. For example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, and expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets. E MPLOYEE B ENEFIT P LANS Dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. The projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued obligations and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. The impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between Dominion assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately. The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost trend rates are critical assumptions. Dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of: Historical return analysis to determine expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations; Forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indices; Expected inflation and risk-free interest rate assumptions; and Investment allocation of plan assets. The strategic target asset allocation for Dominion pension funds is 28% U.S. equity, 18% non-U.S. equity, 33% fixed income, 3% real estate and 18% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments. Strategic investment policies are established for each of Dominion prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. Factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Deviations from the plans strategic allocation are a function of Dominion assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. Through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. Dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of other independent investment advisors to ensure reasonableness. An internal committee selects the final assumptions. Dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.75% for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets. Dominion determines discount rates from analyses of AA/Aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. The discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 6.60% in 2010 and 2009, compared to 6.60% and 6.50%, respectively, in 2008. Dominion selected a discount rate of 5.90% for determining its December 31, 2010 projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. Dominion healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of December 31, 2010 is 7.0% and is expected to gradually decrease to 4.60% by 2060 and continue at that rate for years thereafter. The following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant: Increase in Net Periodic Cost Change in Actuarial Assumption Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits (millions, except percentages) Discount rate (0.25 )% $ 13 $ 5 Long-term rate of return on plan assets (0.25 )% 13 3 Healthcare cost trend rate 1.00 % N/A 23 In addition to the effects on cost, at December 31, 2010, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase Dominion projected pension benefit obligation by $138 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $52 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $217 million. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. R EVENUE R ECOGNITION U NBILLED R EVENUE Virginia Power recognizes and records revenues when energy is delivered to the customer. The determination of sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, the amounts of electric energy delivered to customers, but not yet billed, is estimated and recorded as unbilled revenue. This estimate is reversed in the following month and actual revenue is recorded based on meter readings. Virginia Power customer receivables included $397 million and $355 million of accrued unbilled revenue at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The calculation of unbilled revenues is complex and includes numerous estimates and assumptions including historical usage, applicable customer rates, weather factors and total daily electric generation supplied, adjusted for line losses. Changes in generation patterns, customer usage patterns and other factors, which are the basis for the estimates of unbilled revenues, could have a significant effect on the calculation and therefore on Virginia Power results of operations and financial condition. Other A CCOUNTING S TANDARDS AND P OLICIES During 2009 and 2008, Dominion and Virginia Power were required to adopt several new accounting standards, which are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents D OMINION R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS Presented below is a summary of Dominion consolidated results: Year Ended December 31, 2010 $ Change 2009 $ Change 2008 (millions, except EPS) Net Income attributable to Dominion $ 2,808 $ 1,521 $ 1,287 $ (547 ) $ 1,834 Diluted EPS 4.76 2.59 2.17 (0.99 ) 3.16 Overview 2010 VS . 2009 Net income attributable to Dominion increased by 118%. Favorable drivers include a gain on the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations, lower ceiling test impairment charges related to these properties, the absence of a charge in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings and the impact of favorable weather on electric utility operations. Unfavorable drivers include charges related to a workforce reduction program, a loss on the sale of Peoples, lower margins from merchant generation operations and impairment charges related to certain merchant generation facilities. 2009 VS . 2008 Net income attributable to Dominion decreased by 30%. Unfavorable drivers include an impairment charge related to the carrying value of Dominion E&P properties due to declines in gas and oil prices during the first quarter of 2009 and a charge in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings. Favorable drivers include higher margins in Dominion merchant generation operations and a higher contribution from Dominion gas transmission operations due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project. Analysis of Consolidated Operations Presented below are selected amounts related to Dominion results of operations: Year Ended) December 31, 2010 $ Change 2009 $ Change 2008 (millions) Operating Revenue $ 15,197 $ 399 $ 14,798 $ (1,097 ) $ 15,895 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases 4,150 (135 ) 4,285 262 4,023 Purchased electric capacity 453 42 411 411 Purchased gas 2,050 (150 ) 2,200 (966 ) 3,166 Net Revenue 8,544 642 7,902 (393 ) 8,295 Other operations and maintenance 3,724 12 3,712 428 3,284 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,055 (83 ) 1,138 104 1,034 Other taxes 532 49 483 (10 ) 493 Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations 2,467 2,467 Other income (loss) 169 (25 ) 194 236 (42 ) Interest and related charges 832 (57 ) 889 60 829 Income tax expense 2,057 1,461 596 (357 ) 953 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (155 ) (181 ) 26 (164 ) 190 An analysis of Dominion results of operations follows: 2010 VS . 2009 Net Revenue increased 8%, primarily reflecting: A $1.1 billion increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting: The absence of a charge for the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings ($570 million); The impact of Riders C1 and C2, R, S and T ($279 million); An increase in sales to retail customers primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days ($248 million); and An increase in ancillary revenues received from PJM ($78 million), primarily reflecting an increase in the scheduled dispatch of gas and oil-fired generation units to meet higher demand; partially offset by A decrease primarily due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($75 million); A $98 million increase from regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily reflecting increased rider revenue associated with the recovery of bad debt expense ($60 million) and an increase in base rates ($40 million); and A $46 million increase related to natural gas transmission operations largely due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project. These increases were partially offset by: A $356 million decrease from merchant generation operations due to a decrease at certain nuclear generating facilities ($237 million) primarily due to lower realized prices, a decline in margins at certain fossil generation facilities ($70 million) 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued primarily due to an increase in fuel prices and the expiration of certain requirements-based power sales contracts in December 2009 ($49 million); A $222 million decrease reflecting the sale of substantially all of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010; and A $40 million decrease in producer services primarily related to unfavorable price changes on economic hedging positions and lower physical margins, all associated with natural gas aggregation, marketing and trading activities. Other operations and maintenance increased $12 million primarily reflecting: A $240 million net increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily related to a workforce reduction program. As a result of the program, Dominion expects to avoid future annualized operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $100 million that would have otherwise been incurred; Impairment charges related to certain merchant generating facilities ($194 million); A $103 million increase due to the absence of a benefit in 2009 from a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a unit that is no longer in service; A $56 million increase in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily related to low income assistance programs ($60 million). These expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net income; and A $42 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures. These increases were partially offset by: A $434 million decrease in ceiling test impairment charges related to the carrying value of Dominion E&P properties; The absence of a $142 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings; and A $48 million decrease in outage costs due to a decrease in scheduled outage days primarily at certain merchant generation facilities. DD&A decreased 7%, primarily due to the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations ($45 million) and lower amortization due to decreased cost of emissions allowances consumed ($37 million). Other taxes increased 10%, primarily due to additional property tax from increased investments and higher rates ($16 million), an increase in gross receipts tax due to new non-regulated retail energy customers ($14 million) and higher payroll taxes associated with a workforce reduction program ($12 million). Gain on sale of Appalachian E&P operations reflects a gain on the sale of these operations, as described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income decreased 13%, primarily reflecting an increase in charitable contributions ($46 million) and a decrease in interest income ($15 million); partially offset by the absence of an impairment loss on an equity method investment ($30 million) and higher realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($12 million). Interest and related charges decreased 6%, primarily due to a benefit resulting from the net effect of the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain interest rate hedges and subsequent changes in fair value of these interest rate derivatives ($73 million), partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the June 2009 hybrid issuance ($26 million). Income tax expense increased $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher federal and state taxes largely due to the gain on the sale of Dominion Appalachian E&P business. Loss from discontinued operations primarily reflects a loss on the sale of Peoples. 2009 VS . 2008 Net Revenue decreased 5%, primarily reflecting: A $614 million decrease in net revenue from electric utility operations primarily due to a charge for the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings; An $86 million decrease in sales of gas production from E&P operations primarily reflecting the expiration of VPP royalty interests; and A $21 million decrease in net gas revenue from retail energy marketing operations primarily due to lower prices ($39 million), partially offset by higher volumes ($18 million). These decreases were partially offset by: A $161 million increase from merchant generation operations, primarily reflecting lower fuel expenses due to the impact of lower commodity prices ($190 million) and higher sales volumes primarily from fewer scheduled nuclear refueling outages and higher demand for natural gas generation ($143 million), partially offset by lower sales prices ($79 million) and increased fuel consumption ($93 million) at certain fossil generation facilities; A $158 million increase related to gas transmission operations largely due to the completion of the Cove Point expansion project; and A $70 million increase in net electric revenue from retail energy marketing operations primarily attributable to higher volumes ($36 million) and the acquisition of a retail energy marketing business in September 2008 ($34 million). Other operations and maintenance expense increased 13%, primarily reflecting the combined effects of: A $455 million ceiling test impairment charge related to the carrying value of E&P properties due to declines in natural gas and oil prices; A $142 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings; and A $74 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits largely due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs. These increases were partially offset by: A $103 million downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning ARO for a power station unit that is no longer in service; The absence of a $59 million charge related to the impairment of a DCI investment sold in 2008; and A $29 million decrease largely due to the deferral of electric transmission-related expenditures collectible under certain rate adjustment clauses. 38 Table of Contents DD&A increased 10%, principally due to higher depreciation from property additions ($100 million) and higher amortization due to increased consumption of emissions allowances ($37 million), partially offset by decreased DD&A reflecting lower gas and oil production ($19 million) and a decrease in DD&A rates ($28 million) at Dominion E&P properties. Other income (loss) increased $236 million primarily due to the impact of net realized gains (including investment income) on merchant nuclear decommissioning trust funds in 2009 as compared to net realized losses (net of investment income) in 2008. Interest and related charges increased 7%, primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings ($34 million) and the absence of a $23 million benefit related to the redemption of Virginia Power Callable and Puttable Enhanced Securities in 2008. Income tax expense decreased by 37%, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income in 2009. Outlook In order to deliver favorable returns to investors, Dominion strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. The goals of this strategy are to provide earnings per share growth, a growing dividend and a stable credit profile. Dominion 2010 results were positively impacted by the gain on the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations. In 2011, Dominion operating businesses will likely experience a decrease in net income on a per share basis as compared to 2010. Dominion anticipated 2011 results reflect the following significant factors: Lower realized margins from its merchant generation operations due to lower commodity prices and an increase in planned outages at certain nuclear and fossil facilities; A return to normal weather in its electric utility operations; and The absence of earnings from Appalachian E&P operations sold in April 2010; partially offset by Growth in electric sales resulting from the recovering economy; A benefit from rate adjustment clause revenue associated with Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center; A reduction in certain operations and maintenance expenses resulting largely from the implementation of cost-containment measures, including the workforce reduction program discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Lower outage costs at certain electric utility generating facilities. Dominion also expects the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation recently enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2010, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to reduce income taxes otherwise payable by $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion during 2011 through 2013. The acceleration of these tax deductions is expected to reduce the domestic production activities income tax deduction through 2012 and will also increase deferred taxes, thereby reducing rate base for regulated operations. However, Dominion plans to partially mitigate the earnings per share impact of these items by using the cash tax savings to repurchase common stock in 2011 and reduce the amount of debt that would have otherwise been issued over the next three years. In addition, Dominion does not plan any market issuances of common stock in 2011 or 2012. Dominion expects its operating businesses to provide five percent to six percent growth in net income on a per share basis in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to its assumptions regarding construction and operation of new infrastructure in its utility operations, fewer merchant outages and an anticipated rise in commodity prices and energy demand.

Analysis of Consolidated Operations Presented below are selected amounts related to Virginia Power results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2010 $ Change 2009 $ Change 2008 (millions) Operating Revenue $ 7,219 $ 635 $ 6,584 $ (350 ) $ 6,934 Electric fuel and other energy-related purchases 2,495 (477 ) 2,972 265 2,707 Purchased electric capacity 449 40 409 (1 ) 410 Net Revenue 4,275 1,072 3,203 (614 ) 3,817 Other operations and maintenance 1,745 122 1,623 218 1,405 Depreciation and amortization 671 30 641 33 608 Other taxes 218 27 191 8 183 Other income 100 (4 ) 104 52 52 Interest and related charges 347 (2 ) 349 40 309 Income tax expense 542 395 147 (353 ) 500 41 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued An analysis of Virginia Power results of operations follows: 2010 VS . 2009 Net Revenue increased 33%, primarily reflecting: The absence of a charge for the settlement of the 2009 base rate case proceedings ($570 million); The impact of Riders C1 and C2, R, S and T ($279 million); An increase in sales to retail customers primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days ($248 million); and An increase in ancillary revenues received from PJM ($78 million), primarily reflecting an increase in the scheduled dispatch of gas and oil-fired generation units to meet higher demand. These increases were partially offset by: A decrease primarily due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on customer usage and other factors ($75 million). Other operations and maintenance increased 8%, primarily reflecting: A $177 million net increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily due to a workforce reduction program. As a result of the program, Virginia Power expects to avoid future annualized operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $50 million that would have otherwise been incurred; A $42 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures; and A $19 million increase in storm damage and service restoration costs. These increases were partially offset by: The absence of a $130 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5%, primarily due to property additions. Other taxes increased 14%, primarily reflecting additional property tax due to increased investments and higher rates ($12 million), incremental use tax that is recoverable through a customer surcharge ($8 million) and higher payroll taxes associated with a workforce reduction program ($7 million). Income tax expense increased $395 million, primarily reflecting higher pretax income in 2010. 2009 VS . 2008 Net Revenue decreased 16%, primarily due to a charge for the settlement of the 2009 base rate case proceedings. Other operations and maintenance expense increased 16%, primarily reflecting: A $130 million write-off of previously deferred RTO costs in connection with the settlement of Virginia Power 2009 base rate case proceedings; A $64 million increase in outage costs related to scheduled outages at certain nuclear and fossil generating facilities; A $43 million increase resulting from higher salaries, wages and benefits largely due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and other general and administrative costs; and A $28 million decrease in gains from the sale of emissions allowances. These increases were partially offset by: A $29 million decrease largely due to the deferral of transmission-related expenditures collectible under certain rate adjustment clauses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5%, primarily due to property additions. Other income increased by $52 million primarily due to an increase in the equity component of AFUDC as a result of construction and expansion projects. Interest and related charges increased 13%, primarily due to the absence of a $23 million benefit related to the redemption of Virginia Power Callable and Puttable Enhanced Securities in 2008, and a $17 million impact largely due to the impact from additional borrowings. Income tax expense decreased 71%, reflecting lower pre-tax income in 2009. Outlook Virginia Power expects to provide growth in net income in 2011. Virginia Power anticipated 2011 results reflect the following significant factors: Growth in electric sales resulting from the recovering economy; A benefit from rate adjustment clause revenue associated with Bear Garden and Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center; A reduction in certain operations and maintenance expenses resulting largely from the implementation of cost-containment measures, including the workforce reduction program discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and Lower outage costs at certain generating facilities; partially offset by A return to normal weather in its electric utility operations. Virginia Power also expects the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation recently enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2010, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to reduce income taxes otherwise payable by $600 million to $1.2 billion during 2011 through 2013. The acceleration of these tax deductions is expected to reduce the domestic production activities income tax deduction through 2012 and will also increase deferred taxes, thereby reducing the regulated rate base. However, Virginia Power plans to partially mitigate the earnings impact of these items by using the cash tax savings to reduce the amount of debt that would have otherwise been issued over the next three years.

L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES Dominion and Virginia Power depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities. At December 31, 2010, Dominion had $2 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities, including $559 million of unused capacity under joint credit facilities available to Virginia Power. See additional discussion under Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt . A summary of Dominion cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 50 $ 71 $ 287 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,825 3,786 2,676 Investing activities 419 (3,695 ) (3,490 ) Financing activities (2,232 ) (112 ) 598 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 12 (21 ) (216 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year (1) $ 62 $ 50 $ 71 (1) 2009 and 2008 amounts include $2 million and $5 million, respectively, of cash classified as held for sale in Dominion Consolidated Balance Sheets. A summary of Virginia Power cash flows is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 19 $ 27 $ 49 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,409 1,970 1,235 Investing activities (2,425 ) (2,568 ) (2,003 ) Financing activities 1,002 590 746 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (14 ) (8 ) (22 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 5 $ 19 $ 27 Operating Cash Flows In 2010, net cash provided by Dominion operating activities decreased by approximately $2 billion, primarily due to lower deferred fuel and gas cost recoveries, contributions to Dominion pension plans, the absence of disposed Appalachian E&P operations, lower merchant generation margins and refunds related to the 2009 Virginia Power base rate case settlement, partially offset by lower income tax payments, lower margin collateral requirements and the favorable impact of weather and rate adjustment clauses on electric utility operations. In 2010, net cash provided by Virginia Power operating activities decreased by $561 million, primarily due to lower deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction, refunds related to the 2009 Virginia base rate case settlement, and contributions to Dominion pension plans; partially offset by the favorable impact of weather and rate adjustment clauses, and cash received for income tax benefits in 2010, as compared to income taxes paid in 2009. Dominion lower income tax payments and Virginia Power realization of income tax benefits in 2010 resulted in part from the bonus depreciation provisions of the tax legislation recently enacted by the U.S. Congress, discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. In 2011, Dominion board of directors adopted a new dividend policy that raised its target payout ratio. The Board established an annual dividend rate of $1.97 per share of common stock, a 7.7% increase over the 2010 rate. Quarterly dividends are subject to declaration by the Board. Virginia Power believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and provide dividends to Dominion. The Companies operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. C REDIT R ISK Dominion exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion credit exposure as of December 31, 2010 for these activities. Gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights. Gross Credit Exposure Credit Collateral Net Credit Exposure (millions) Investment grade (1) $ 426 $ 26 $ 400 Non-investment grade (2) 10 3 7 No external ratings: Internally rated-investment grade (3) 102 102 Internally rated-non-investment grade (4) 82 82 Total $ 620 $ 29 $ 591 (1) Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody and Standard & Poor s. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 33% of the total net credit exposure. (2) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 1% of the total net credit exposure. (3) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 11% of the total net credit exposure. (4) The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 8% of the total net credit exposure. 44 Table of Contents Virginia Power exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from sales to wholesale customers and is not considered material at December 31, 2010. Investing Cash Flows In 2010, net cash provided by Dominion investing activities was $419 million as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.7 billion in 2009. This change is primarily due to the proceeds received from the sale of substantially all of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations in April 2010 and the sale of Peoples in February 2010. While taxes and other costs of the sales are reflected in cash flow from operations, the gross proceeds from the sales are reported in cash flow from investing activities. In 2010, net cash used in Virginia Power investing activities decreased by $143 million, primarily due to lower capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in restricted cash equivalents designated to finance certain qualifying facilities. Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity Dominion and Virginia Power rely on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by their operations. As discussed in Credit Ratings , the Companies ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances and, in the case of Virginia Power, approval by the Virginia Commission. Each of the Companies currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the Securities Act of 1933. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows the Companies to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for business combination transactions. In 2010, net cash used in Dominion financing activities increased by $2.1 billion, primarily due to net debt repayments in 2010 as compared to net debt issuances in 2009, and net repurchases of common stock in 2010 as compared to issuances of common stock in 2009. This reflects the use of proceeds from the sales of Dominion Appalachian E&P operations and Peoples. In 2010, net cash provided by Virginia Power financing activities increased by $412 million, primarily due to higher net debt issuances in 2010 as compared to 2009, as a result of lower cash flow from operations. C REDIT F ACILITIES AND S HORT -T ERM D EBT Dominion and Virginia Power use short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties. Dominion and Virginia Power replaced certain of their existing credit facilities in September 2010, as noted below. In connection with commodity hedging activities, the Companies are required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. Under certain collateral arrangements, the Companies may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. From time to time, the Companies vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. These factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which the Companies can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives. D OMINION Commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities were as follows: At December 31, 2010 Facility Limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Available (millions) Three-year joint revolving credit facility (1) $ 3,000 $ 1,386 $ 101 $ 1,513 Three-year joint revolving credit facility (2) 500 35 465 Total $ 3,500 $ 1,386 (3) $ 136 $ 1,978 (1) This credit facility was entered into in September 2010 and terminates in September 2013.

(2) This credit facility was entered into in September 2010 and terminates in September 2013. This credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings, commercial paper and letter of credit issuances. (3) The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by Dominion credit facilities was 0.41% at December 31, 2010. V IRGINIA P OWER Virginia Power short-term financing is supported by two three-year joint revolving credit facilities with Dominion. These credit facilities are being used for working capital, as support for the combined commercial paper programs of Dominion and Virginia Power and for other general corporate purposes. Virginia Power share of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as its capacity available under its joint credit facilities with Dominion were as follows: At December 31, 2010 Facility Sub-limit Outstanding Commercial Paper Outstanding Letters of Credit Facility Capacity Available (millions) Three-year joint revolving credit facility (1) $ 1,000 $ 600 $ 91 $ 309 Three-year joint revolving credit facility (2) 250 250 Total $ 1,250 $ 600 (3) $ 91 $ 559 (1) This credit facility was entered into in September 2010 and terminates in September 2013.

Virginia Power current sub-limit under this credit facility can be increased or decreased multiple times per year. 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued (2) This credit facility was entered into in September 2010 and terminates in September 2013. This credit facility can be used to support bank borrowings, commercial paper and letter of credit issuances. Virginia Power current sub-limit under this credit facility can be increased or decreased multiple times per year. (3) The weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by these credit facilities was 0.41% at December 31, 2010. In addition to the credit facility commitments mentioned above, Virginia Power also has a three-year $120 million credit facility that was entered into in September 2010. The facility, which terminates in September 2013, supports certain tax-exempt financings of Virginia Power. L ONG -T ERM D EBT During 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power issued the following long-term debt: Type Principal Rate Maturity Issuing Company (millions) Senior notes $ 250 2.25 % 2015 Dominion Senior notes 300 3.45 % 2022 Virginia Power Total notes issued $ 550 In November 2010, Virginia Power borrowed $105 million in connection with the Industrial Development Authority of Wise County Solid Waste and Sewage Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 A, which mature in 2040 and bear a coupon rate of 2.375% for the first five years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds will be used to finance certain qualifying facilities at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. In December 2010 and September 2009, Virginia Power borrowed $100 million and $60 million, respectively, in connection with the $160 million Industrial Development Authority of Wise County Solid Waste and Sewage Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2009 A, which mature in 2040 and bear interest during the initial period at a variable rate. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Virginia Power acquired the bonds upon issuance with the intention of remarketing them to third parties at a later time. The proceeds will be used to finance certain qualifying facilities at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. At December 31, 2010, these bonds had not been remarketed and thus are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In December 2010, Virginia Power borrowed $100 million in connection with the Industrial Development Authority of Halifax County, Virginia Recovery Zone Facility Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 A, which mature in 2041 and bear interest at a variable rate for the first seven years, after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time, using a remarketing process. The proceeds will be used to finance certain qualifying facilities in Halifax County and/or Wise County. In December 2010, Brayton Point borrowed approximately $160 million and approximately $75 million in connection with the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency Recovery Zone Facility Bonds, Series 2010 A and the Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 B, respectively, which mature in 2041 and bear interest during the initial period at a variable rate. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Dominion acquired the bonds upon issuance in December 2010 with the intention of remarketing them to third parties at a later time. The proceeds will be used to finance certain qualifying facilities at Brayton Point. At December 31, 2010, these bonds had not been remarketed and thus are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2010, Dominion and Virginia Power repaid and repurchased $1.5 billion and $347 million, respectively, of long-term debt and notes payable. I SSUANCE OF C OMMON S TOCK During 2010, Dominion issued 2.3 million shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $74 million. The shares issued and cash proceeds received during 2010 were through Dominion Direct , employee savings plans and the exercise of employee stock options. Dominion does not currently plan any market issuances of common stock in 2011 or 2012. In February 2010, Dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market with proceeds received through Dominion Direct and employee savings plans, rather than issuing additional new common shares. In 2010, Virginia Power issued 33,013 shares of its common stock to Dominion for approximately $1 billion. The proceeds were used to pay down short-term demand note borrowings from Dominion. R EPURCHASE O F C OMMON S TOCK In March 2010, Dominion began repurchasing common shares in anticipation of proceeds from the sale of its Appalachian E&P operations. During 2010, Dominion purchased 21.4 million shares of its common stock for approximately $900 million. On January 28, 2011, Dominion announced that it intends to repurchase between $400 million and $700 million of common stock with cash tax savings resulting from the extension of the bonus depreciation allowance discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the first quarter of 2011, Dominion began repurchasing shares on the open market under this program. B ORROWINGS F ROM P ARENT Virginia Power has the ability to borrow funds from Dominion under both short-term and long-term borrowing arrangements and at December 31, 2010, its nonregulated subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings, net of repayments, under the Dominion money pool of $24 million. Virginia Power short-term demand note borrowings from Dominion were $79 million at December 31, 2010. There were no long-term borrowings from Dominion at December 31, 2010. Credit Ratings Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Dominion and Virginia Power believe that their current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. However, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to Dominion and Virginia Power may affect their ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. Dominion and Virginia Power credit ratings may affect their liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which they are able to offer their debt securities. 46 Table of Contents Both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual company credit rating. Credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. The credit ratings for Dominion and Virginia Power are most affected by each company financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions. In January 2010, Fitch lowered its credit ratings for Virginia Power preferred stock and Dominion junior subordinated debt securities and enhanced junior subordinated notes solely due to a revision in Fitch ratings methodology such that it now rates these securities two notches below its credit rating for senior unsecured debt securities. In December 2010, Moody raised its credit ratings for Virginia Power, reflecting sustained improvements in Virginia Power financial performance as measured by its credit metrics and the agency views of a generally supportive regulatory and political environment in Virginia Power service territory. Credit ratings as of February 23, 2011 follow: Fitch Moody Standard & Poor Dominion Senior unsecured debt securities BBB+ Baa2 A- Junior subordinated debt securities BBB- Baa3 BBB Enhanced junior subordinated notes BBB- Baa3 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 Virginia Power Mortgage bonds A A1 A Senior unsecured (including tax-exempt) debt securities A- A3 A- Junior subordinated debt securities BBB Baa1 BBB Preferred stock BBB Baa2 BBB Commercial paper F2 P-2 A-2 As of February 23, 2011, Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of Dominion and Virginia Power. A downgrade in an individual company credit rating would not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it would likely increase the cost of borrowing. Dominion and Virginia Power work closely with Fitch, Moody and Standard & Poor with the objective of maintaining their current credit ratings. In order to maintain current ratings, the Companies may find it necessary to modify their business plans and such changes may adversely affect growth and EPS. Debt Covenants As part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, Dominion and Virginia Power must enter into enabling agreements. These agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. These provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. These provisions are not necessarily unique to Dominion and Virginia Power. Some of the typical covenants include: The timely payment of principal and interest; Information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the SEC and information about changes in Dominion and Virginia Power credit ratings to lenders; Performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation, and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets; Compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and Limitations on liens. Dominion and Virginia Power are required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain their credit facilities. In addition, their credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect their ability to borrow under these facilities. They include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions. As of December 31, 2010, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows: Company Maximum Allowed Ratio Actual Ratio (1) Dominion 65 % 54 % Virginia Power 65 % 46 % (1) Indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as AOCI reflected as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These provisions apply separately to Dominion and Virginia Power. If Dominion or Virginia Power or any of either company material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require that company to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and the lenders could terminate their commitment to lend funds to that company. Accordingly, any default by Dominion will not affect the lenders commitment to Virginia Power. However, any default by Virginia Power would affect the lenders commitment to Dominion under the joint credit agreements. Dominion executed RCCs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities: June 2006 hybrids; September 2006 hybrids; and June 2009 hybrids. Under the terms of the RCCs, Dominion covenants to and for the benefit of designated covered debtholders, as may be designated from time to time, that Dominion shall not redeem, repurchase, or defease all or any part of the hybrids, and shall not cause its majority owned subsidiaries to purchase all or any part of the hybrids, on or before their applicable RCC termination date, unless, subject to certain limitations, during the 180 days prior to such activity, Dominion has received a specified amount of proceeds as set forth in the RCCs from the sale of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than the applicable characteristics of the hybrids 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued at that time, as more fully described in the RCCs. The proceeds Dominion receives from the replacement offering, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must equal or exceed the redemption or repurchase price. At December 31, 2010, the termination dates and covered debt under the RCCs associated with Dominion hybrids are as follows: Hybrid RCC Termination Date Designated Covered Debt Under RCC June 2006 hybrids 6/30/2036 September 2006 hybrids September 2006 hybrids 9/30/2036 June 2006 hybrids June 2009 hybrids 6/15/2034 (1) 2008 Series B Senior Notes, 7.0% due 2038 (1) Automatically extended, as set forth in the RCC, for additional quarterly periods, to the extent the maturity date is extended. Dominion and Virginia Power monitor the debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. As of December 31, 2010, there have been no events of default under or changes to Dominion debt covenants. Dividend Restrictions The Virginia Commission may prohibit any public service company, including Virginia Power, from declaring or paying a dividend to an affiliate if found to be detrimental to the public interest. At December 31, 2010, the Virginia Commission had not restricted the payment of dividends by Virginia Power. Certain agreements associated with Dominion and Virginia Power credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. These limitations did not restrict Dominion or Virginia Power ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from their subsidiaries at December 31, 2010. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by Dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes. Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and Planned Capital Expenditures C ONTRACTUAL O BLIGATIONS Dominion and Virginia Power are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating them to make cash payments in future years. These contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. Presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which Dominion and Virginia Power are parties as of December 31, 2010. For purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. Actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. The table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. The majority of Dominion and Virginia Power current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2011.

(7) Excludes regulatory liabilities, AROs and employee benefit plan obligations, which are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. See Notes 13, 15 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $253 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (8) Includes interest rate swap agreements.

(4) Excludes regulatory liabilities, AROs and employee benefit plan contributions that are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. See Notes 13, 15 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $113 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. Deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. P LANNED C APITAL E XPENDITURES Dominion planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $3.9 billion, $4.7 billion and $4.4 billion in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Dominion expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, environmental upgrades, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets and purchases of nuclear fuel. Virginia Power planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $2.2 billion, $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Virginia Power expenditures are expected to include construction and expansion of electric generation facilities, environmental upgrades, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets and purchases of nuclear fuel. Dominion and Virginia Power expect to fund their capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. Planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the Board of Directors. Based on available generation capacity and current estimates of growth in customer demand, Virginia Power will need additional generation in the future. See Dominion Generation-Properties in Item 1. Business for a discussion of Virginia Power expansion plans. These estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. The Companies may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances. Use of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements G UARANTEES Dominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the provisions of FASB guidance that dictate a guarantor accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others . At December 31, 2010, Dominion had issued $131 million of guarantees, primarily to support equity method investees. No significant amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. As of December 31, 2010, Dominion exposure under these guarantees was $54 million, primarily related to certain reserve requirements associated with non-recourse financing. L EASING A RRANGEMENT Dominion leases Fairless in Pennsylvania, which began commercial operations in June 2004. During construction, Dominion acted as the construction agent for the lessor, controlled the design and construction of the facility and has since been reimbursed for all project costs ($898 million) advanced to the lessor. Dominion makes annual lease payments of $53 million. The lease expires in 2013 and at that time, Dominion may renew the lease at negotiated amounts based on original project costs and current market conditions, subject to lessor approval; purchase Fairless at its original construction cost plus 51% of any appraised value in excess of original construction cost; or sell Fairless, on behalf of the lessor, to an independent third party. If Fairless is sold and the proceeds from the sale are less than its original construction cost, Dominion would be required to make a payment to the lessor in an amount up to 70.75% of original project costs adjusted for certain other costs as specified in the lease. The lease agreement does not contain any provisions that involve credit rating or stock price trigger events. Benefits of this arrangement include: Certain tax benefits as Dominion is considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes. As a result, Dominion is entitled to tax deductions for depreciation not recognized for financial accounting purposes; and As an operating lease for financial accounting purposes, the asset and related borrowings used to finance the construction of the asset are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although this improves measures of leverage calculated using amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, credit rating agencies view lease obligations as debt equivalents in evaluating Dominion credit profile. F UTURE I SSUES AND O THER M ATTERS See Item 1. Business, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Notes 14 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations and/or financial condition. Environmental Matters Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. E NVIRONMENTAL P ROTECTION AND M ONITORING E XPENDITURES Dominion incurred approximately $228 million, $252 million and $205 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2010, 2009, and 2008 respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $231 million and $251 million in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $351 million, $266 million, and $254 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $398 million and $553 million for 2011 and 2012, respectively. 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Continued Virginia Power incurred approximately $144 million, $134 million and $125 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities and expects these expenses to be approximately $142 million and $156 million in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $101 million, $109 million and $116 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These expenditures are expected to be approximately $72 million and $341 million for 2011 and 2012, respectively. F UTURE E NVIRONMENTAL R EGULATIONS There have already been federal and state legislative proposals and regulatory action regarding the regulation of GHG emissions. Dominion and Virginia Power expect that there may be federal legislation and/or regulatory action regarding compliance with more stringent air emission standards, regarding coal combustion by-products, and regarding regulation of cooling water intake structures and discharges in the future. With respect to GHG emissions, in December 2010, the EPA announced a schedule for when they will propose regulations which would establish GHG performance standards for new, modified and existing fossil-fired electric generating units. Regulations are expected to be proposed by July 2011 and finalized by May 2012. This means that Dominion new, modified, and existing fossil-fired electric generating units will become subject to GHG performance standards, if these rules are finalized. The EPA has not provided any detail yet on what the performance standard might be or what measures facilities might have to make to reach the standard. With respect to emission reductions of SO 2 , NO x , mercury and HAPs (in addition to mercury), specific requirements will depend on the following: Final outcome of the EPA scheduled rulemaking for developing MACT standards for mercury and other HAPs to replace the CAMR vacated by a federal court in 2008; The final outcome of the EPA Transport Rule proposed in July 2010 in response to a federal court remand of the CAIR as well as future state regulations implementing requirements to address the EPA promulgation of revised NAAQS for SO 2 and NO 2; and EPA impending rulemaking to revise the ozone NAAQS. With respect to cooling water intakes and discharges, the Companies expect future federal regulation on cooling water intake structures and the quality of water discharges, and more focus by the EPA and state regulatory authorities on thermal discharge issues. With respect to coal combustion by-products, Dominion and Virginia Power expect federal regulation of coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices. If any of these new proposals are adopted, additional significant expenditures may be required. Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law in July 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions that will require certain over-the-counter derivatives, or swaps, to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, can be exempted from these clearing and exchange trading requirements. In addi- tion, the Dodd-Frank Act allows the CFTC and SEC to impose initial and variation margin requirements on entities who execute swaps. End users were not expressly exempt from these requirements for non-cleared swaps; however, key legislators indicated in a public letter that it was their intention to exclude commercial hedging transactions by end users from these requirements. Final rules for the over-the-counter derivative-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the clearing, exchange trading and margin requirements, will be established through the CFTC and SEC rulemaking process, which is required to be completed by July 2011. If, as a result of the rulemaking process, Dominion or Virginia Power derivative activities are not exempted from the clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, the Companies could be subject to higher costs for their derivative activities, including from higher margin requirements. In addition, implementation of, and compliance with, the over-the-counter derivative provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by the Companies swap counterparties could result in increased costs related to the Companies derivative activities. Due to the ongoing rulemaking process, the Companies are currently unable to assess the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act derivative-related provisions on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
