ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The purpose of the following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is to help facilitate the understanding of significant factors influencing the operating results, financial condition and cash flows of Gartner, Inc. Additionally, the MD&A also conveys our expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods. References to the Company, we, our, and us are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In 2012 we acquired Ideas International Limited ( Ideas International ), a publicly-owned Australian corporation (see Note 2 Acquisition in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Ideas International business operations have been integrated into the Company Research segment, and its operating results and business measurements are included in the Company consolidated and segment results beginning on the date of acquisition. The impact of the acquisition was not material. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is the world leading information technology research and advisory company that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to thousands of client organizations across the globe. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and executives from a wide variety of business enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides objective insight on critical and timely technology and supply chain initiatives for CIOs, other IT professionals, supply chain leaders, technology companies and the investment community through reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts, peer networking services, and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions about their IT and supply chain investments. Consulting provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency, and quality. Events provide IT, supply chain, and business professionals the opportunity to attend various symposia, conferences and exhibitions to learn, contribute and network with their peers. From our flagship event Symposium/ITxpo, to Summits focused on specific technologies and industries, to experimental workshop-style Seminars, our events distill the latest Gartner research into applicable insight and advice. BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. 14 Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION We have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive double-digit annual revenue and earnings growth. The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness. We had total revenues of $1,615.8 million in 2012, an increase of 10% over 2011 while diluted earnings per share increased by $.34 per share, to $1.73. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, 2012 total revenues increased 12% over 2011. Research revenues rose 12% year-over-year, to $1,137.1 million in 2012, and the contribution margin increased 1 point, to 68%. At December 31, 2012, Research contract value was $1,262.9 million, an increase of 14% over December 31, 2011 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. Client retention was 83% and wallet retention was 99% at December 31, 2012. Consulting revenues in 2012 decreased 1% compared to 2011, while the gross contribution margin was 36%. Consultant utilization was 67% for 2012 compared to 65% in 2011, and we had 503 billable consultants at December 31, 2012 compared to 481 at year-end 2011. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year, to $102.7 million at December 31, 2012. Events revenues increased 17% year-over-year, to $173.8 million, while the segment contribution margin was 46%. We held 62 events in 2012 compared to 60 in 2011, with an increase in overall attendance of 8%, to 46,307. For a more detailed discussion of our results, see the Segment Results section below. Cash flow from our operating activities increased 9% in 2012 compared to 2011, to $279.8 million. We continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2012, and we repurchased 2.7 million of our common shares outstanding during the year. We ended 2012 with almost $300.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to our record year-end cash balance, as of year-end 2012 we also had almost $347.0 million of borrowing capacity on our $400.0 million revolving credit facility. We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs. The Company 2010 Credit Agreement expires in December 2015. The Company is currently exploring refinancing options to take advantage of favorable market conditions. 15 FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series, which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; general economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. The preparation of our financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. On-going changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company financial statements in future periods. Our critical accounting policies are as follows: Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shipped. Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment. Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. Uncollectible fees receivable We maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2012 2011 Total fees receivable $ 470,368 $ 428,293 Allowance for losses (6,400 ) (7,260 ) Fees receivable, net $ 463,968 $ 421,033 16 Goodwill and other intangible assets The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge against earnings. Among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or general economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. The annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two. Both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. In 2012, we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach. Based on this assessment, the Company believes the fair values of the Company reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts. See Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the period such determination is made. Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110 ). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note 8 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding stock-based compensation). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the Company Common Stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Restructuring and other accruals We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after year end. 17 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results The following tables summarize the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operation for the three years ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Total revenues $ 1,615,808 $ 1,468,588 $ 147,220 10 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 659,067 608,755 (50,312 ) (8 )% Selling, general and administrative 678,843 613,707 (65,136 ) (11 )% Depreciation 25,369 25,539 170 1 % Amortization of intangibles 4,402 6,525 2,123 33 % Acquisition & integration charges 2,420 (2,420 ) (100 )% Operating income 245,707 214,062 31,645 15 % Interest expense, net (8,859 ) (9,967 ) 1,108 11 % Other expense, net (1,252 ) (1,911 ) 659 34 % Provision for income taxes (69,693 ) (65,282 ) (4,411 ) (7 )% Net income $ 165,903 $ 136,902 $ 29,001 21 % Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Total revenues $ 1,468,588 $ 1,288,454 $ 180,134 14 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 608,755 552,238 (56,517 ) (10 )% Selling, general and administrative 613,707 543,174 (70,533 ) (13 )% Depreciation 25,539 25,349 (190 ) (1 )% Amortization of intangibles 6,525 10,525 4,000 38 % Acquisition & integration charges 7,903 7,903 100 % Operating income 214,062 149,265 64,797 43 % Interest expense, net (9,967 ) (15,616 ) 5,649 36 % Other (expense) income, net (1,911 ) 436 (2,347 ) >(100 )% Provision for income taxes (65,282 ) (37,800 ) (27,482 ) (73 )% Net income $ 136,902 $ 96,285 $ 40,617 42 % 2012 VERSUS 2011 TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 increased $147.2 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Total revenues increased 12% excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Revenues increased by double-digits in both our Research and Events segments but declined slightly in Consulting. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions, with a double-digit increase in Research revenues in every region. An overview of our revenues by geographic region follows: Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 10%, to $947.1 million in 2012 from $861.5 million in 2011. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased to $458.6 million in 2012 from $437.2 million in 2011, a 5% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region increased to $210.1 million in 2012 from $169.9 million in 2011, a 24% increase. 18 An overview of our revenues by segment follows: Research revenues increased 12% in 2012, to $1,137.1 million compared to $1,012.1 million in 2011, and comprised 70% and 69% of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Consulting revenues decreased 1% in 2012, to $304.9 million compared to $308.0 million in 2011, and comprised 19% and 21% of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Events revenues increased 17% in 2012, to $173.8 million compared to $148.5 million in 2011, and comprised 11% of total revenues in 2012 and 10% in 2011. Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS ) expense increased 8% in 2012, or $50.3 million, to $659.1 million compared to $608.8 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we continued to invest to support the growth in our business, and to a lesser extent, merit salary increases. We also had higher conference costs and related travel expenses due to an increase in the number of events, as well as additional attendees and exhibitors at our events. These additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency. COS as a percentage of revenues was 41% for both periods. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased by $65.1 million in 2012, or 11%, to $678.8 million compared to $613.7 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. The higher payroll and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount, and to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions and merit salary increases. The increased headcount includes additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 1,417 at December 31, 2012, a 12% increase over the prior year-end. DEPRECIATION expense decreased slightly year-over-year due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated which was only partially offset by the additional depreciation related to asset additions. Capital expenditures increased to $44.3 million in 2012 from $42.0 million in 2011, which includes $17.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of expenditures for the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. Up to $25.0 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord, and as of December 31, 2012, $22.0 million had been reimbursed. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES decreased year-over-year due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized, which was only partially offset by the additional amortization from the intangible assets recorded from the Ideas International acquisition in mid-2012. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $2.4 million in 2012 and zero in 2011. These charges related to the acquisition of Ideas International and included legal, consulting, severance, and other costs. OPERATING INCOME increased $31.6 million year-over-year, or 15%, to $245.7 million in 2012 from $214.1 million in 2011. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 15% for both periods. Although both Research and Events had higher segment contributions in 2012, these increases were partially offset by a lower contribution in Consulting, as well as higher SG&A expenses, as discussed above. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET declined by 11% in 2012 when compared to 2011. The decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding, which declined to $207.0 million in 2012 from $220.0 million in 2011, as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs. OTHER EXPENSE, NET was $1.3 million in 2012 and $1.9 million in 2011. These expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $69.7 million in 2012 compared to $65.3 million in 2011 and the effective tax rate was 29.6% for 2012 compared to 32.3% for 2011. The lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits in 2012 resulting from the settlement of tax audits, as well as benefits recorded in 2012 relating to the recognition of certain state tax credits. During 2012, the Company closed the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) audit of its 2007 federal income tax return. The resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations of the Company. In 2011 the IRS commenced an audit of the Company federal income tax returns for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. The IRS has proposed adjustments for both 2008 and 2009 and the Company expects to settle the audit in early 2013. Although the audit has not been fully resolved, the Company believes that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 19 The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Tax Act ) was enacted in January of 2013 and contains beneficial tax provisions for the Company which apply retroactively to 2012. However, since the Tax Act was passed in 2013, approximately $1.5 million of tax benefits relating to its retroactive application will be recorded by the Company in the first quarter of 2013. NET INCOME was $165.9 million in 2012 and $136.9 million in 2011, an increase of $29.0 million, or 21%, primarily due to a higher operating income, which was partially offset by $4.4 million in higher income tax charges. Although the year-over-year effective tax rate declined, pre-tax income increased substantially, resulting in the higher dollar amount of tax charges. Both basic and diluted earnings per share increased 24% year-over-year due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding. 2011 VERSUS 2010 TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 increased $180.1 million, or 14%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Total revenues increased 11% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business segments on a reported basis. An overview of our results by geographic region follows: Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 12%, to $861.5 million in 2011 from $765.8 million in 2010. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased to $437.2 million in 2011 from $380.8 million in 2010, a 15% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region increased 20%, to $169.9 million in 2011 from $141.9 million in 2010. An overview of our results by segment follows: Research revenues increased 17% in 2011, to $1,012.1 million compared to $865.0 million in 2010, and comprised 69% and 67% of our total revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Consulting revenues increased 2% in 2011, to $308.0 million compared to $302.1 million in 2010, and comprised approximately 21% and 23% of our total revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Events revenues increased 22% in 2011, to $148.5 million compared to $121.3 million in 2010, and comprised approximately 10% of total revenues in both 2011 and 2010. Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS ) expense increased 10% in 2011, or $56.5 million, to $608.8 million compared to $552.2 million in 2010. Approximately half of the increase was due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from our investment in additional headcount and merit salary increases. The rest of the increase was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation, as well as incremental expenses and additional investment in the Events business. COS as a percentage of revenues improved by 2 points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher research revenues and the operating leverage inherent in our Research business. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased by $70.5 million in 2011, or 13%, to $613.7 million from $543.2 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and to a lesser extent, the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, SG&A expense increased 11% year-over-year. The higher payroll costs resulted from additional investment in headcount, as well as higher sales commissions and merit salary increases. The increased headcount was primarily due to our investment in additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased 21% compared to December 31, 2010. DEPRECIATION expense increased slightly year-over-year. Capital spending increased to $42.0 million in 2011 from $21.7 million in 2010. The $42.0 million of capital expenditures in 2011 included $9.5 million of expenditures related to the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility, of which $9.0 million was reimbursed by our landlord in 2011. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES decreased 38% year-over-year due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2010. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was zero in 2011 and $7.9 million in 2010. These charges related to the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group in December 2009 and included legal, consulting, severance, and other costs. 20 OPERATING INCOME increased $64.8 million year-over-year, or 43%, to $214.1 million in 2011 from $149.3 million in 2010. Operating income as a percentage of revenues improved by 3 points year-over-year, to 15% in 2011 compared to 12% in 2010, primarily due to a significantly higher segment contribution from the Research business and to a lesser extent, lower intangible amortization and acquisition and integration charges. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $10.0 million in 2011 compared to $15.6 million in 2010, a 36% decline. The $15.6 million of interest expense in 2010 included $3.7 million of incremental expense related to the refinancing of our debt (See Note 5 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the $3.7 million incremental charge, Interest expense, net declined approximately 15% year-over-year, primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding, which declined to $220.0 million in 2011 from $326.0 million in 2010. OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $(1.9) million in 2011, which primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses, and $0.4 million in 2010, which consisted of a $2.4 million gain from an insurance recovery related to a prior period loss, offset by net foreign currency exchange losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $65.3 million in 2011 compared to $37.8 million in 2010 and the effective tax rate was 32.3% for 2011 compared to 28.2% for 2010. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowances relating to certain net operating losses. NET INCOME was $136.9 million in 2011 and $96.3 million in 2010, an increase of $40.6 million, or 42%, primarily due to a substantially higher operating income, which was partially offset by higher income tax charges. Basic earnings per share increased 42% year-over-year while diluted earnings per share increased 45% due to the higher net income. SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. The following sections present the results of our three business segments: Research 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 As Of And For The Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 As Of And For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) As Of And For The Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 As Of And For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $ 1,137,147 $ 1,012,062 $ 125,085 12 % $ 1,012,062 $ 865,000 $ 147,062 17 % Gross contribution (1) $ 774,342 $ 682,136 $ 92,206 14 % $ 682,136 $ 564,527 $ 117,609 21 % Gross contribution margin 68 % 67 % 1 point 67 % 65 % 2 points Business Measurements: Contract value (1) $ 1,262,865 $ 1,115,801 $ 147,064 13 % $ 1,115,801 $ 977,710 $ 138,091 14 % Client retention 83 % 82 % 1 point 82 % 83 % (1) point Wallet retention 99 % 99 % 99 % 98 % 1 point (1) Dollars in thousands. 2012 VERSUS 2011 Research segment revenues increased 12% in 2012 compared to 2011 but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, Research segment revenues increased 14%. The segment gross contribution margin increased by 1 point, driven by higher revenues and the operating leverage in this business. Contribution margin improved in spite of a 10% increase in segment headcount as we continue to invest for future growth. Research contract value increased 13% in 2012, to $1,262.9 million, but increased 14% year-over-year excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. We had double-digit contract value growth across all of our Research product lines and client sizes, and almost every industry group. The number of research client organizations we serve increased by 7% in 2012, to 13,305, and has increased 27% since 2009. We attribute the increase in contract value and the number of client organizations we serve to our extraordinary research content, our continuing focus on sales effectiveness, and the expansion in the number of our quota-bearing sales associates. Both client retention and wallet retention remained strong during 2012 at 83% and 99%, respectively. 21 2011 VERSUS 2010 Research segment revenues increased 17% in 2011 compared to 2010 and reached the one billion dollar level for the first time. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, Research segment revenues increased 14%. The segment gross contribution margin increased by 2 points, to 67%, as higher segment revenues and the operating leverage in this business resulted in a higher segment contribution. Research contract value increased 14% in 2011, to $1,115.8 million. Foreign currency translation had an immaterial impact year-over-year on contract value. We had double-digit contract value growth in most of our Research product lines, client sizes, and industry groups. Client retention and wallet retention remained strong at 82% and 99%, respectively. Consulting 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 As Of And For The Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 As Of And For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) As Of And For The Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 As Of And For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $ 304,893 $ 308,047 $ (3,154 ) (1 )% $ 308,047 $ 302,117 $ 5,930 2 % Gross contribution (1) $ 109,253 $ 114,838 $ (5,585 ) (5 )% $ 114,838 $ 121,885 $ (7,047 ) (6 )% Gross contribution margin 36 % 37 % (1) point 37 % 40 % (3) points Business Measurements: Backlog (1) $ 102,718 $ 100,564 $ 2,154 2 % $ 100,564 $ 100,839 $ (275 ) Billable headcount 503 481 22 5 % 481 473 8 2 % Consultant utilization 67 % 65 % 2 points 65 % 68 % (3) points Average annualized revenue per billable headcount (1) $ 430 $ 424 $ 6 1 % $ 424 $ 424 $ (1) Dollars in thousands. 2012 VERSUS 2011 Consulting revenues decreased 1% year-over-year due to lower revenues in our contract optimization business. Contract optimization revenues, which can fluctuate from period to period, currently represent about 10% of total Consulting segment revenues and have been declining over time as a percentage of overall segment revenue. The decrease in contract optimization revenue was substantially offset by higher core consulting revenues, which increased 5% year-over-year, driven by additional demand and increased headcount. Strategic advisory ( SAS ) revenues were flat year-over-year, in accordance with our segment plan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 1% year-over-year. The gross contribution margin declined by 1 point due to the lower revenues in our contract optimization business, which has a higher contribution margin than core consulting or SAS. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year, to $102.7 million at December 31, 2012. 2011 VERSUS 2010 Consulting revenues increased 2% year-over-year primarily due to higher revenues in core consulting. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues were down slightly. The gross contribution margin declined by 3 points, due to lower utilization in core consulting and higher payroll and benefit costs resulting from merit salary increases and the full year impact in 2011 from the additional headcount we added in the fourth quarter of 2010. Backlog was down slightly year-over-year, to $100.6 million at December 31, 2011. Events 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 As Of And For The Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 As Of And For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) As Of And For The Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 As Of And For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 Increase (Decrease) Percentage Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $ 173,768 $ 148,479 $ 25,289 17 % $ 148,479 $ 121,337 $ 27,142 22 % Gross contribution (1) $ 80,119 $ 66,265 $ 13,854 21 % $ 66,265 $ 55,884 $ 10,381 19 % Gross contribution margin 46 % 45 % 1 point 45 % 46 % (1) point Business Measurements: Number of events 62 60 2 3 % 60 56 4 7 % Number of attendees 46,307 42,748 3,559 8 % 42,748 37,219 5,529 15 % (1) Dollars in thousands. 22 2012 VERSUS 2011 Events revenues increased 17% year-over-year, or $25.3 million, but excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 20% year-over-year. We held 62 events in 2012 compared to 60 in 2011. The 62 events held in 2012 consisted of 57 ongoing events and 5 new event launches, with 3 events held in prior years discontinued, while the overall number of attendees and exhibitors increased 8% and 20%, respectively. Average revenue per attendee rose 3% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 1%. Both the additional revenue and the higher contribution margin in 2012 were primarily due to the significantly higher exhibitor volume at our ongoing events. 2011 VERSUS 2010 Events revenues increased 22% year-over-year, or $27.1 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 21%. We held 60 events in 2011, which consisted of 53 ongoing events and 7 new event launches, compared to 56 events in 2010. We discontinued 3 events in 2011 that had been held in prior years. The additional revenue we earned in 2011 was attributable to significantly higher revenue at our ongoing events, with double-digit increases in the number of attendees and exhibitors. Average revenue per attendee rose 2% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 5%. For full year 2011, gross contribution margin decreased 1 point, primarily due to incremental expenses and additional investment in the business to strengthen the portfolio and provide a foundation for future growth. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our operating activities. For 2012, we had operating cash flow of $279.8 million, which was the highest in the Company history and an increase of 9% over 2011. Our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies. Revenues in our Research segment, which increased 12% in 2012 compared to 2011, constituted 70% and 69% of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our Research contracts generally renew annually and typically are paid in advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has generally resulted in strong growth in operating cash flow each year. Our cash flow generation has also been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as the effective management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume. In addition to the strong increase in our operating cash flows, we also had almost $300.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2012, which was the highest cash balance in the Company history, and $347.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at year-end 2012. We believe that our strong operating cash flow, as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs. The Company 2010 Credit Agreement expires in December 2015. The Company is currently exploring refinancing options to take advantage of favorable market conditions. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2012, approximately $167.0 million of our cash was held outside the U.S. Approximately half of the amount of cash held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our non-U.S subsidiaries. Under U.S. accounting rules, no provision for U.S. federal and local taxes is required for these unremitted overseas earnings if the Company intends to reinvest such funds overseas. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S operations, and as a result we intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. As a result, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been recorded for these unremitted earnings. However, should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings, we may be required to accrue for U.S. taxes as a result, and these charges could be material and would be recorded in future periods. 23 Changes in cash and cash equivalents The following disclosure summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending December 31, 2012 (in thousands): 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Increase (Decrease) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 Increase (Decrease) Cash provided by operating activities $ 279,813 $ 255,566 $ 24,247 $ 255,566 $ 205,499 $ 50,067 Cash used for investing activities (54,673 ) (41,954 ) (12,719 ) (41,954 ) (33,845 ) (8,109 ) Cash used in financing activities (72,570 ) (186,559 ) 113,989 (186,559 ) (171,556 ) (15,003 ) Net increase 152,570 27,053 125,517 27,053 98 26,955 Effects of exchange rates 4,543 (4,495 ) 9,038 (4,495 ) 3,509 (8,004 ) Beginning cash and cash equivalents 142,739 120,181 22,558 120,181 116,574 3,607 Ending cash and cash equivalents $ 299,852 $ 142,739 $ 157,113 $ 142,739 $ 120,181 $ 22,558 2012 VERSUS 2011 Operating Operating cash flow increased by 9%, or $24.2 million, in 2012 compared to 2011, which was primarily due to higher net income. We also had lower cash payments for interest on our debt and other items, as well as higher cash reimbursements related to the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. These increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash payments for income taxes during 2012. Investing Cash used for investing purposes was $54.7 million in 2012, an increase in cash used of $12.7 million compared to 2011, due to $10.3 million of cash used for the acquisition of Ideas International and higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $44.3 million in 2012 compared to $42.0 million in 2011, which included $17.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, which we paid for the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. Up to $25.0 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord, and $13.0 million was reimbursed in 2012 and $9.0 million in 2011. The reimbursements are included in operating cash flows. Financing We used $114.0 million less cash in our financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a lower number of shares repurchased. Cash used for share repurchases was $111.3 million in 2012 compared to $212.0 million in 2011, with 2.7 million and 5.9 million of shares repurchased, respectively. Cash used also declined due to net debt activity, as we borrowed an additional $5.0 million in 2012 compared to $20.1 million of debt repayments in 2011. 2011 VERSUS 2010 Operating Operating cash flow increased by 24%, or $50.1 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to $40.6 million in higher net income and lower cash payments for acquisition costs, severance, and other costs. We also received $9.0 million in landlord cash reimbursements for capital expenditures on the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. These increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash bonus and commission payments we paid in 2011 due to our stronger financial performance. Investing We used $8.1 million of additional cash in our investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010, due to higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $42.0 million in 2011 compared to $21.7 million in 2010. We also made $12.2 million in payments related to the acquisition of Burton Group in early 2010, which we acquired in December 2009. The $42.0 million of capital expenditures in the 2011 period included $9.5 million we paid for the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility, which is fully reimbursable by the landlord. The Company received reimbursement of $9.0 million of this amount in 2011. Financing We used an additional $15.0 million of cash in our financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to additional share repurchases. During 2011, we used $212.0 million for share repurchases, compared to $99.8 million in 2010. The increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2011 was substantially offset by lower debt repayments in 2011 compared to 2010. On a net basis, we repaid $99.8 million of debt in 2010 and we paid $4.8 million in fees related to our refinancing, compared to $20.1 million of debt repayments in 2011. 24 OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS At December 31, 2012, we had $200.0 million outstanding under our 2010 Credit Agreement which provides for a five-year, $200.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility. The 2010 Credit Agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased, at the Company option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional $150.0 million in the aggregate. The term loan will be repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments with the final payment due in December 2015, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the Company option. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $40.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until December 2015, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 5 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2010 Credit Agreement. Cash Commitments The Company has certain contractual commitments that require future payment. The following table presents the Company contractual cash commitments due after December 31, 2012 (in thousands): Due In Due In Due In Due In Commitment Description: Less Than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Total Debt principal and interest (1) $ 47,100 $ 168,900 $ 300 $ 5,300 $ 221,600 Operating leases (2) 37,820 53,9550 24,590 75,055 191,420 Deferred compensation arrangement (3) 2,730 5,185 3,160 20,240 31,315 Tax liabilities (4) 2,225 2,225 Other (5) 16,500 13,900 1,790 32,190 Totals $ 106,375 $ 241,940 $ 29,840 $ 100,595 $ 478,750 (1) Includes both the term and revolver principal amounts borrowed under the Company 2010 Credit Agreement, which matures in December 2015(see Note 5 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), as well as estimated interest payments. Amounts borrowed under the term loan arrangement have been classified in the table based on the scheduled repayment dates, while revolver borrowings are classified in the Due In 2-3 Years category since the amounts are not contractually due until December 2015. Also included is the $5.0 million the Company borrowed in December 2012 under a State of Connecticut economic development program which has a 10 year maturity and is included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category. Interest payments on amounts outstanding under the 2010 Credit Facility are based on a floating rate. However, the Company has a $200.0 million notional interest rate swap that converts the variable interest payments on the debt to a 2.26% fixed rate on the first $200.0 million of borrowings. As a result, in order to calculate an estimate for the future interest payments, the Company has used a rate of 3.76%, which includes the swap rate of 2.26% plus a loan margin of 1.50%, for the 2010 Credit Facility. (2) The Company leases various facilities, furniture, autos, and computer equipment. These leases expire between 2013 and 2027 (see Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). (3) Represents the Company liability to participants in its supplemental deferred compensation arrangement (see Note 13 Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Amounts payable to active employees whose payment date is unknown have been included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category since the Company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid. (4) Includes interest and penalties. In addition to the $2.2 million tax liability, $16.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table, the Company has also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $3.4 million. (5) Includes contractual commitments for software, building maintenance, and telecom services. 25 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA The following tables present our quarterly operating results for the two year period ended December 31, 2012: 2012 (In thousands, except per share data) First Second Third Fourth Revenues $ 369,171 $ 397,482 $ 374,406 $ 474,749 Operating income 53,556 62,722 49,768 79,661 Net income 34,221 41,484 31,375 58,823 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.37 $ 0.44 $ 0.34 $ 0.63 Diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ 0.33 $ 0.61 2011 (In thousands, except per share data) First Second Third Fourth Revenues $ 329,567 $ 365,543 $ 345,784 $ 427,694 Operating income 45,781 51,568 47,250 69,463 Net income 29,191 32,223 30,464 45,024 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.30 $ 0.33 $ 0.32 $ 0.48 Diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.32 $ 0.31 $ 0.46 (1) The aggregate of the four quarters basic and diluted earnings per common share may not equal the reported full calendar year amounts due to the effects of share repurchases, dilutive equity compensation, and rounding. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The FASB has issued new accounting rules which have not yet become effective. These new rules are described below, together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods: Other Comprehensive Income Reclassifications . In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The standard requires that public companies present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. Public companies will also have to provide this information in both their annual and interim financial statements. The new requirements will take effect for Gartner beginning January 1, 2013 and will be applied prospectively. While the Company has not completed its analysis of the new standard, it believes the new rule may result in additional disclosures and changes to the presentation of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Balance Sheet Offsetting . In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . The new guidance requires disclosures about assets and liabilities that are offset or have the potential to be offset under U.S. GAAP rules. The new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements. These disclosures are intended to address differences in the asset and liability offsetting requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance will be effective for Gartner for interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013, with retrospective application required. While the adoption of this new guidance may result in additional disclosures, we do not expect it to have an impact on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. The FASB also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which may impact the Company accounting and disclosures in future periods. Since these rules have not yet been issued, the effective dates and potential impact are unknown.
