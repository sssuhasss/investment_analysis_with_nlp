ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Revenue recognition We lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned. We record all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate. Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets We carry real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and 6 months for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. Development costs are capitalized in accordance with accounting standards for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and standards for the capitalization of interest cost. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on long-lived assets and evaluate goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors. 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. We determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments We utilize certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While our calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedge are measured by us before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated. We measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. The valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. Additionally, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 TABLE OF CONTENTS OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 We experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations before non-operating items in 2009 as the increases in revenues from new acquisitions and renovation projects were more than offset by the decrease in revenues from our same store portfolio of 1.2% over 2008. Our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations. We have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. We acquired four properties in 2007, five properties in 2008 and four properties in 2009. We also purchased one property through a joint venture in 2009 and two properties in 2008. Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were five property dispositions in 2007, one of which was through a joint venture, and three property dispositions in 2009. We benefited from reduced interest expense in 2009 as our twelve month average interest rate dropped from 4.9% in 2008 to 4.3% in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the total number of apartment units Mid-America owned or had an ownership interest in was 43,604 in 147 communities, compared to 42,554 apartment units in 145 communities at December 31, 2008, and 40,248 apartment units in 137 communities at December 31, 2007. For communities owned 100% by Mid-America, the average effective rent per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, decreased to $715 at December 31, 2009 from $750 at December 31, 2008, and $737 at December 31, 2007. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was 95.2%, 93.4%, and 94.7%, respectively. The following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2009, to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by approximately $8.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due to (i) a $2.6 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2009, or the 2009 acquisitions, (ii) a $7.1 million increase in property revenues from the five properties acquired in 2008, or the 2008 acquisitions, and (iii) a $2.5 million increase in property revenues from our development communities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of $3.8 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The decrease in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was due primarily to Mid-America same store portfolio and was driven by a 2.2% decrease in average effective rent per unit in 2009 over 2008. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased by approximately $4.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $1.2 million from the 2009 acquisitions, (ii) $2.8 million from the 2008 acquisitions, and (iii) $0.9 million from our development communities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property operating expenses of $0.5 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The decrease in property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods was due primarily to Mid-America same store portfolio and represented real estate tax expense which reflected the favorable impact of successful prior year appeals and assessment challenges. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $5.9 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $0.6 million from the 2009 acquisitions, (ii) $2.1 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (iii) $0.7 million from our development communities, and (iv) $3.5 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.0 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair value of in place leases of communities which we previously acquired. Interest expense decreased approximately $4.9 million in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 4.9% in 2008 to 4.3% in 2009. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $34.9 million from 2008 to 2009 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded total gains of approximately $4.6 million from the sale of three communities. We had no property dispositions in 2008. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. increased by approximately $7.0 million in 2009 from 2008. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008, to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by approximately $22.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008, due to (i) a $7.2 million increase in property revenues from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) a $5.8 million increase in property revenues from the four properties acquired in 2007, or the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) a $1.7 million increase in property revenues from our development communities, and (iv) a $7.7 million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by our same store portfolio and was driven by a 1.8% increase in average effective rent per unit in 2008 over 2007. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, increased by approximately $12.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $3.5 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) $2.9 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.8 million from our development communities, and (iv) $5.7 million from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods consisted primarily of our same store portfolio and represented an average 3.5% increase over prior year expenses and included $591,000 of expense related to Hurricane Ike. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $5.4 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $2.3 million from the 2008 acquisitions, (ii) $1.6 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million from our development communities, and (iv) $3.0 million from fixed asset additions at communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.8 million from the expiration of the amortization of fair value of in place leases of communities which we previously acquired. Property management expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007, to the year ended December 31, 2008, due to decreased incentive compensation. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million over this same period mainly as a result of increased personnel costs. Interest expense decreased approximately $1.6 million in 2008 from 2007 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 5.4% in 2007 to 4.9% in 2008. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $83.8 million from 2007 to 2008 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded total gains of approximately $5.4 million from the sale of a community owned through a joint venture. The sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to us of approximately $1.0 million in 2007. In 2007, we also benefited from a $9.2 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities owned directly by us. We had no property dispositions in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded net casualty gains and other settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $1.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a loss of $0.3 million for these same items. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. decreased by approximately $9.7 million in 2008 from 2007. Funds from Operations Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in operating partnership income, gains on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation. Our policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Our calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 (dollars and shares in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Consolidated net income $ 39,221 $ 32,071 $ 43,456 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (2,010 ) (1,822 ) (3,510 ) Net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 37,211 30,249 39,946 Depreciation of real estate assets 94,020 88,555 83,532 Net casualty (gains) loss and other settlement proceeds (32 ) 247 (589 ) Gains on dispositions within real estate joint ventures (38 ) (5,388 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of discontinued operations 706 1,517 (Gains) loss on sales of discontinued operations (4,649 ) 120 (9,164 ) Depreciation of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures 970 953 15 Preferred dividend distribution (12,865 ) (12,865 ) (13,688 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,010 1,822 3,510 Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock (589 ) Funds from operations $ 116,665 $ 109,749 $ 99,102 FFO increases for both 2009 over 2008, and 2008 over 2007 benefited from the addition of communities from the 2007 acquisitions, 2008 acquisitions and 2009 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. The FFO increase for 2008 over 2007 also benefited from improved community operations from our same store portfolio. Trends During 2009, rental demand for apartments was weaker in most of our markets when compared to 2008. One of the primary drivers of apartment demand is job formation, and the job losses across our markets impacted apartment demand and pricing. However, relative job losses in 2009 for our markets combined were less than the national average. An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the Sunbelt region of the United States. The diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We have found that a well diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, has tended to perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better. At the end of 2009, we were invested in over 48 separate markets, with 59% of our gross assets in large markets and 41% of our gross assets in select secondary markets. Partially mitigating the severe job losses in 2009 was lower resident turnover, primarily due to fewer move-outs from buying homes. The primary reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house. In 2009, we saw both the number and the percent of total move-outs due to home buying drop as compared to 2008. According to the Census Bureau, homeownership increased from 65% to 69% of households over the ten years ending 2005. Despite the tightened credit market, in 2009 the home ownership rate was still in the 67% to 68% range. The increase from historical levels was driven primarily by the availability of new mortgage products, many requiring no down-payment and minimal credit ratings. With a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more traditional standards, it is possible that a long-term correction will occur, and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels. This could be quite significant for the apartment business, and we believe, if this occurs, it could benefit us for several years. We also benefited on the supply side, as supply declined from 2008 and ran below historical new supply delivery averages. Competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in our markets because most of our markets and submarkets 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We saw significant rental competition from condominiums and/or single family houses in only a few submarkets. We expect this relative new supply compression to be an even larger factor over the next several quarters as supply is expected to contract even further. Our focus during 2009 was on sustaining occupancy as we operated in a weaker leasing market. By focusing on aggressive efforts to build and sustain traffic, and pricing aggressively, we were largely successful at this, as our same store occupancy ended the year 170 basis points over year-end 2008 and dropped only 90 basis points from the record levels of the quarter ended September 30, 2009, despite the normal seasonal decline in traffic. Overall same store revenues decreased 1.2% compared to 2008. We believe that the decline in same store revenue will continue into 2010, primarily due to the impact of lower rents on leases signed in the latter half of 2009. However, revenue growth should resume after the economic growth returns and, most importantly, when job growth resumes which some economists project could be as soon as the middle to latter part of 2010. We also believe reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment supply, and more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. At the same time, we expect long-term demographic trends, including the growth of prime age groups for rentals, immigration, and population movement to the southeast and southwest will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets. While expected continued weak employment growth is expected to keep new demand subdued, we think that the supply of new apartments is not excessive, and that positive absorption of apartments will return for most of our markets later in 2010. Should the economy fall into a deeper recession, the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact. We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues. The continued roll-out of ancillary services (such as re-selling cable television), improved collections, and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue dollars. We also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively. During 2009, we continued to have the benefit of lower interest rates resulting from an improved market for Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation debt securities. Much of this was due to government action to improve liquidity in the credit markets, and resulted in a lower cost of debt for us. Short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels, and as a result, we are forecasting a continuation of favorable interest rates in the near term with the expectation of rising rates as the economy improves. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $1.0 million to $136.9 million for 2009, compared to $137.9 million for 2008, mainly related to the decrease in rental rates from 2008 to 2009. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $19.3 million to $137.9 million for 2008 compared to $118.6 million for 2007 mainly related to our growth through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2008. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $150.5 million, $243.0 million and $108.8 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in net cash used in investing activities resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity. A total of approximately $125.3 million was invested in 2009 to acquire properties, this compares to approximately $156.3 million in 2008 and $88.6 million in 2007. We began limited development activities in 2006, which used net cash of approximately $14.6 million in 2007, $22.7 million in 2008 and $6.8 million in 2009. We have also been renovating select properties using net cash of approximately $7.6 million in 2009, $18.2 million in 2008 and $11.3 million in 2007. In 2007 and 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS 2009, we received a total of $39.2 million and $29.9 million, respectively, from the disposition of real estate assets, mainly related to property sales. No communities were sold in 2008. Net cash provided by financing activities was $18.1 million, $97.3 million and $1.9 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fluctuation in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units was primarily impacted by sales of common stock through our controlled equity offering program. Mid-America received a total of $32.8 million, $103.6 million and $18.8 million in net proceeds during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in relation to sales through this program. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was also impacted by the redemption of our 9 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series F, for $11.9 million. During 2009, Mid-America sold 763,000 shares of common stock through our continuous equity offering program generating net proceeds of approximately $32.8 million. In 2008 and 2007, Mid-America sold 1,955,300 shares and 323,700 shares generating net proceeds of approximately $103.6 million and $18.8 million, respectively. During 2009, Mid-America did not offer a discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 1,100 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $39,000 in proceeds. However, during 2008 and 2007, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 403,000 shares and 120,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $20 million and $6 million in proceeds, respectively. On October 16, 2007, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series F for the total redemption price of $11.9 million. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2009 for the $1.4 billion of debt outstanding was 4.0%, compared to the weighted average interest rate of 4.8% on $1.3 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2008. We utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as company-wide secured credit facilities. We utilize fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section. At December 31, 2009, we had secured credit facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, Financial Federal which are credit enhanced by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and a $50 million bank facility with a syndicate of banks. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $1.4 billion with all but $6.0 million collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2009. We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009. Approximately 72% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2009 were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, also referred to as the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $1.04 billion, all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2009. We had total borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities of approximately $1.00 billion at December 31, 2009. Various traunches of the FNMA Facilities mature from 2011 through 2018. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate which are credit-enhanced by FNMA and are typically sold every 90 days by Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month LIBOR less a spread that has averaged 0.16% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.49% to 0.67%. We have seen more volatility in the spread between the DMBS and three-month LIBOR since late 2007 than was historically prevalent. While we feel this recent volatility is an anomaly and believe that this spread will return to more historic levels, we cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change. Approximately 21% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2009 were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie Mac Facilities. The Freddie Mac Facilities have a combined line limit of $300 million, of which $298 million was collateralized and 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS available to borrow at December 31, 2009. We had total borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facilities of approximately $298 million at December 31, 2009. The Freddie Mac facilities mature in 2011 and 2014. The interest rate on the Freddie Mac Facilities renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate on the date of renewal, which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90-day LIBOR, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.65% to 0.69%. The Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has traded consistently below LIBOR, and the historical average spread has risen to 0.40% below LIBOR. Each of our secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and is subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods, one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect. The following schedule details the line limits, collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Line Limit Amount Collateralized Amount Borrowed FNMA Credit Facilities $ 1,044,429 $ 1,044,429 $ 1,004,833 Freddie Mac Credit Facilities 300,000 298,247 298,247 Regions Credit Facility 50,000 45,774 Other Borrowings 96,516 96,516 96,516 Total Debt $ 1,490,945 $ 1,484,966 $ 1,399,596 As of December 31, 2009, we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of $883 million. To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $172 million as of December 31, 2009.

We rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and on FNMA and Freddie Mac, or the Agencies, who have now been placed into conservatorship by the U.S. Government, and whose securities are now implicitly Government-guaranteed. The Agencies provide credit enhancement for approximately $1.3 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2009. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, which was appointed conservator of the Agencies, recognizes the importance of multifamily housing finance for healthy secondary market and housing affordability, and expects FNMA and Freddie MAC to continue underwriting and financing sound multifamily business. The interest rate markets for FNMA DMBS and Freddie Mac Reference Bills, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a DUS lender for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Financial Federal, a Freddie Mac Program Plus Lender and Servicer, is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between Financial Federal and us. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $10.2 million, as compared to $12.7 million and $4.1 million for the same periods in 2008 and 2007, respectively. While we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2009, (dollars in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt (2) $ 1,827 $ 181,929 $ 82,036 $ 170,778 $ 536,518 $ 426,508 $ 1,399,596 Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3) 43,120 35,404 26,395 18,911 9,742 19,234 152,806 Operating Lease 18 18 10 46 Total $ 44,965 $ 217,351 $ 108,441 $ 189,689 $ 546,260 $ 445,742 $ 1,552,448 (1) Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table. The average interest rates of variable rate debt are shown in preceding and following tables. (2) Represents principal payments. (3) Swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in Note 7 to the financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2009, and 2008, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Our two joint ventures with Crow Holdings (one terminated in 2005 and one terminated in 2007) were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance our return on investment through the generation of fee income. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2009, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC owned two properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities. Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, was established to acquire $250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2009, Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II, owned one property. In January 2010, Mid-America contributed a property we had acquired in December 2009 to Fund II. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13. Our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest. Insurance We renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2009. We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation. Inflation Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable Mid-America to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to Mid-America of the adverse effects of inflation. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 105-10, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Overall which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the Codification, as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered, non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates, or ASUs. The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own right. ASUs will serve only to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the Codification. We adopted ASC 105-10 effective July 1, 2009 and all references made to FASB guidance throughout this document have been updated for the Codification. In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASC 820-10-65-1 delayed the effective date of ASC 820 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For these items, the effective date was for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 820 effective January 1, 2008 and ASC 820-10-65-1 effective January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. On December 4, 2007, the FASB revised ASC 805, Business Combinations . The ASC 805 revision significantly changes the accounting for business combinations. The ASC 805 revision requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. The ASC 805 revision changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition costs, which will generally be expensed as incurred. This could have a material impact on the way we account for property acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on our financial statements. The ASC 805 revision applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted the ASC 805 revision effective January 1, 2009, and the expensed acquisition costs increased general and administrative expenses by $950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The increased expenses decreased both basic and diluted net income available for common shareholders by $0.04 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009. On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-65, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51 . ASC 810-10-65 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this standard requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. The standard clarifies that changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. This has impacted our financial statement presentation by requiring the interests in the operating partnership not owned by the company (noncontrolling interests) be presented as a component of equity in the company consolidated financial statements and income contributable to the noncontrolling interests be a component of net income. ASC 810-10-65 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 810-10-65 effective January 1, 2009 and the retrospective presentation increased total equity by $30,471,000 at December 31, 2008. The adoption did not change basic or diluted earnings per share for common shareholders and its effect on net income and income from continuing operations is as follows (dollars in thousands): 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Increase in: Income from continuing operations $ 1,907 $ 1,718 $ 3,226 Net income $ 2,010 $ 1,822 $ 3,510 On March 19, 2008, the FASB issued ASC 815-10-65, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement 133. ASC 815-10-65 enhances required disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments and how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. ASC 815-10-65 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted ASC 815-10-65 effective January 1, 2009, and the required disclosures are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC 260-10-65, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities to clarify that unvested share-based awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share, or EPS, under the two-class method of computing earnings per share. ASC 260-10-65 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. All prior period EPS data presented are to be adjusted retrospectively (including interim financial statements, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of this standard. We adopted ASC 260-10-65 effective January 1, 2009 and it had a minor impact on our number of shares. The change in our number of shares decreased net income available for common shareholders by $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 and by $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2009. In September 2008, the FASB ratified ASC 820-10-65-3, Issuer Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement . This accounting standard requires that the measurement of liabilities with inseparable, third-party credit enhancements carried at or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis exclude the effect of the credit enhancement. ASC 820-10-65-3 was effective on a prospective basis in the first reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We adopted this accounting standard effective January 1, 2009. This accounting standard removed the effect of the agency credit enhancements from our calculation of the fair value of our derivative instruments and materially increased the value represented on the balance sheet. The impact of ASC 820-10-65-3 on our financial position upon adoption was approximately a $2.0 million increase to the fair value of our derivative instruments. In April 2008, the FASB issued ASC 825-10-65-1, Interim Disclosures About Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments . ASC 825-10-65-1 extends the disclosure requirements concerning the fair value of financial instruments to interim financial statements of publicly traded companies. ASC 825-10-65-1 is effective for interim financial periods ending after June 15, 2009, and the required disclosures are included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events, which establishes the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. ASC 855-10 is effective for interim and financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we have considered subsequent events through February 25, 2010, which is the date our consolidated financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K. In June 2008, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-05, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) . ASC 810-10-05 amends events which would require reconsidering whether an entity is a variable interest entity; it amends the criteria used to determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity; and it expands disclosures about an enterprise involvement in variable interest entities. ASC 810-10-05 is effective for 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009 and earlier application is prohibited. Management does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
