Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 2017 Executive Overview Schlumberger full-year 2017 revenue of $30.4 billion increased 9% year-on-year. This reflects a full year of activity from the acquired Cameron businesses as compared to only three quarters of activity in 2016. In addition to the impact of Cameron, revenue growth was driven by unconventional land resource developments in North America due to the recovery in activity combined with market share gains and improved pricing, as the oil and gas industry began to emerge from the longest and deepest downturn in 30 years. Following two successive years of E&P investment cuts, operators increased their upstream spend in North America by more than 30% in 2017. The increase in oil price afforded by the OPEC agreement gave US producers a means to increase their investment in tight oil. However, apprehension related to growing US supply, and uncertainty surrounding the duration of OPEC and Russia led production cuts held international spending to a level 3% below 2016. During 2017, the outlook improved for international markets, evidenced by a significant increase in the sanctioning of new projects. The number of final investment decisions tripled in 2017 as compared to 2016, with 75% of the new projects planned for shallow and deepwater offshore environments. After starting the year at $55 per barrel, Brent prices fell to $44 in June and then recovered to $67 by the end of the year. The price increase resulted from 2017 demand growth of 1.5 million barrels per day, and strong adherence to a production agreement between OPEC and Russia, which served to reduce oil production by an average of 1.6 million barrels per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Strong demand and restricted supply accelerated the depletion of stocks as the year progressed. By September, OECD crude and product stocks had returned to 2015 levels. As the oil market began to rebalance in 2017, replacement of conventional oil reserves remains a challenge. In 2017, discoveries were at an all-time low due to lower exploration activity, and more than 60% of discovered resources were gas. Oil discoveries accounted for only 3.4 billion barrels, while about 30 billion barrels of conventional oil is produced each year, representing a reserves replacement ratio of only 11%. In the natural gas markets, low Henry Hub prices and flat domestic consumption allowed the US to transition from importer to exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957, and Liquified Natural Gas was the enabler. Global LNG trading increased 11% year-on-year driven by demand in Asia. LNG supply growth was also strong, with the addition of six new liquefaction trains in 2017. In today's well-supplied market, both producers and consumers are reluctant to invest in new projects. While the short-term market outlook remains challenged, strong longer-term demand growth signals a future need for new LNG supply capacity. Schlumberger financial performance in 2017 was driven by land activity in North America, where revenue increased over 80% in line with the average rig count increase. Continued expansion of Schlumberger hydraulic fracturing presence in North America resulted in additional fleet redeployments, which benefited the Production Group. Drilling Group revenue in North America land increased due to the continuing high demand for longer horizontal lateral sections in shale oil wells. Increased Cameron Surface and Drilling Systems product sales and services also contributed to the strong financial performance in North America. North America revenue, including offshore, grew 42% year-on-year. International revenue decreased 2% as compared to 2016. This decline was driven by soft demand for exploration and development-related products and services as E&P budgets remained tight. Activity in Latin American decreased due to Schlumberger decision to align operations with cash collections in Venezuela. Robust activity in the Middle East and Russia, driven by integrated drilling and production projects, as well as an additional quarter of activity from the acquired Cameron businesses partially offset these decreases. During the past three years of unprecedented market downturn, Schlumberger has proactively sought to strengthen its technology offering and presence in key markets around the world. The most recent example is the expansion of its hydraulic fracturing presence in North America land through the purchase of the US fracturing and pump-down perforating businesses from Weatherford. In line with the challenging business environment, over the same period Schlumberger has restructured all relevant parts of the company, in terms of both size and organizational structure, to maximize its market competitiveness and operational agility. With the significant changes seen in customer priorities and buying habits in recent years, Schlumberger has continued to evaluate the present and future return prospects for all of its product lines, as it seeks to maximize its long-term financial performance. Based on 15 this in-depth analysis, Schlumberger identified the seismic acquisition business as the only product line that does not meet Schlumberger return expectations going forward, even after factoring in an eventual market recovery . Schlumberger has, therefore, taken the difficult d ecision to exit the marine and land seismic acquisition market and instead operate the WesternGeco product line as an asset-light business, built on its leading position within multiclient, data processing and geophysical interpretation. Looking at the oil market, the strong growth in demand is projected to continue in 2018, on the back of a robust global economy. On the supply side, the extension of the OPEC- and Russia-led production cuts is already translating into higher-than-expected inventory draws. In North America, 2018 shale oil production is set for another year of strong growth, as the positive oil market sentiments will likely increase both investment appetite and availability of financing. At the same time, the production base in the rest of the world is showing fatigue after three years of unprecedented under-investment. The underlying signs of weakness will likely become more evident in the coming year, as the production additions from investments made in the previous upcycle start to noticeably fall off. Taken together, this means the oil market is now in balance and the previous over-supply discount is gradually being replaced by a market tightness premium, which makes Schlumberger increasingly positive on the global outlook for its business. These positive oil market sentiments are reflected in third-party E&P spend surveys that predict 15-20% growth in North American investments in 2018, while the international market is expected to grow for the first time in four years, with a projected 5% increase in spend. As a result, as Schlumberger enters the first year of expected growth in all parts of its global operations since 2014, there is a renewed excitement and enthusiasm throughout the organization, and Schlumberger remains committed to delivering market-leading products and services to its customers and superior returns to its shareholders. Full-Year 2017 Results (Stated in millions) 2017 2016 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 6,786 $ 1,251 $ 6,648 $ 1,249 Drilling 8,392 1,151 8,561 994 Production 10,639 928 8,804 507 Cameron 5,205 733 4,211 653 Eliminations & other (582 ) (142 ) (414 ) (130 ) Pretax operating income 3,921 3,273 Corporate & other (1) (934 ) (925 ) Interest income (2) 107 84 Interest expense (3) (513 ) (517 ) Charges & credits (4) (3,764 ) (3,820 ) $ 30,440 $ (1,183 ) $ 27,810 $ (1,905 ) (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. Full-year 2017 and 2016 include $252 million and $189 million, respectively, of amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of Cameron, which was completed on April 1, 2016. (2) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (2017: $21 million; 2016: $26 million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (2017: $52 million; 2016: $53 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Full-year 2017 revenue of $30.4 billion increased 9% year-on-year. This included a full year of activity from the acquired Cameron businesses versus nine months of activity for the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Cameron Group, revenue increased 7% year-on-year. The growth was primarily driven by North America, where the land rig count increased more than 80% versus the same period last year. Full-year revenue for the Drilling Group declined 2% primarily driven by the 8% decline in offshore rig count combined with Schlumberger decision in April 2016 to reduce its activities in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections. Production 16 Group revenue increased 21% due to the accelerated land pressure pumping activity growth in North Ame rica, while the Reservoir Characterization Group revenue improved 2%. Full-year 2017 pretax operating margin was expanded 111 basis points ( bps ) to 13%, as improved profitability in North America due to the land activity growth that benefited the Production and Drilling Groups was offset by margin declines in the Reservoir Characterization and Cameron Groups. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year 2017 revenue of $6.8 billion increased 2% year-on-year primarily due to higher WesternGeco and Wireline revenue on projects in the Middle East & Asia Area, North America land, Russia and Mexico. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 18%. Drilling Group Full-year 2017 revenue of $8.4 billion decreased 2% year-on-year primarily due to the rig count declines internationally and in offshore North America combined with pricing pressure. Revenue also declined as a result of Schlumberger decision in April 2016 to reduce its activities in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 210 bps to 14% primarily due to improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing. This improvement was partially offset by the negative impact of reduced activity in Venezuela. Production Group Full-year 2017 revenue of $10.6 billion increased 21% year-on-year with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in North America that benefited the pressure pumping business which grew 44%. Lower Schlumberger Production Management (SPM) production levels in Ecuador partially offset the revenue increase. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 297 bps to 9% as a result of improved profitability in North America due to the accelerated land activity and improved pricing. This was partially offset by reduced margins in SPM due to lower production in Ecuador. Cameron Group The Cameron Group contributed full-year revenue of $5.2 billion. Cameron Group revenue for 2016 included only nine months of revenue following the closing of the acquisition in April 2016. Revenue in 2017 was impacted by a declining project backlog, particularly for the long-cycle businesses of Drilling Systems and OneSubsea. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin of 14% decreased 142 bps as a result of lower Drilling Systems project volumes. 17 Full-Year 201 6 Results (Stated in millions) 2016 2015 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 6,648 $ 1,249 $ 9,501 $ 2,450 Drilling 8,561 994 13,563 2,538 Production 8,804 507 12,548 1,585 Cameron 4,211 653 - - Eliminations & other (414 ) (130 ) (137 ) (63 ) Pretax operating income 3,273 6,510 Corporate & other (1) (925 ) (768 ) Interest income (2) 84 30 Interest expense (3) (517 ) (316 ) Charges & credits (4) (3,820 ) (2,575 ) $ 27,810 $ (1,905 ) $ 35,475 $ 2,881 (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. Full-year 2016 includes $189 million of amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of Cameron, which was completed on April 1, 2016. (2) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (2016: $26 million; 2015: $22 million). (3) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (2016: $53 million; 2015: $30 million). (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Full-year 2016 revenue of $27.8 billion decreased 22% year-on-year. This included nine months of activity from the Cameron Group, which contributed $4.2 billion of revenue. Full-year 2016 revenue from both the Reservoir Characterization and Production Groups declined by 30%, as a result of lower demand for exploration- and development-related products and services as E&P budgets were further reduced. Drilling Group revenue fell 37% due to the rig count decline in both North America and internationally. Full-year 2016 pretax operating income margin decreased 658 bps to 12% as a result of the overall decline in activity and pervasive pricing concessions. The margin decrease was highest in the Reservoir Characterization Group, which contracted by 699 bps to 19%. Drilling Group pretax operating margin fell 710 bps to 12%, while the Production Group decreased 687 bps to 6%. The Cameron Group posted a pretax margin of 16%. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year 2016 revenue of $6.7 billion decreased 30% year-on-year primarily due to sustained cuts in exploration and discretionary spending. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 699 bps to 19% due to reduced high-margin Wireline and Testing Services activities. Drilling Group Full-year 2016 revenue of $8.6 billion decreased 37% year-on-year primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in both North America and internationally combined with pricing pressure that mainly affected Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO activity. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 710 bps to 12% primarily due to the significant decline in higher-margin activities of Drilling & Measurements combined with pricing weakness. 18 Production Group Full-year 2016 revenue of $8.7 billion decreased 30% year-on-year with most of the decrease attributable to a decline in North America, particularly on Well Services pressure pumping technologies driven by activity declines and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 687 bps to 6% as a result of lower activity and increasing pricing pressure, which continued to impact North America land. Cameron Group Cameron Group contributed nine-month revenue of $4.2 billion and pretax operating margin of 16%. Revenue was impacted by a declining project backlog as well as a further slowdown in North America land activity, which also affected the short-cycle businesses of the Valves & Measurement and Surface product lines. Pretax operating margin of 16% was driven by strong project execution and manufacturing efficiency in OneSubsea and overall cost control across the Group. Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2017 2016 2015 Interest income $ 128 $ 110 $ 52 Earnings of equity method investments 96 90 184 $ 224 $ 200 $ 236 The increase in interest income in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to the higher cash and short-term investment balances as a result of the issuance of $6.0 billion of Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in earnings of equity method investments in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas industry, which has negatively impacted the majority of Schlumberger investments in affiliates, particularly those in North America. This decrease also reflects the fact that Schlumberger ceased recording equity income from the OneSubsea joint venture in April 2016 as a result of Schlumberger acquisition of Cameron. Interest Expense Interest expense of $566 million in 2017 was essentially flat as compared to 2016. Interest expense of $570 million in 2016 increased by $224 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the issuance of $6.0 billion of Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the $3.0 billion of debt assumed in the acquisition of Cameron. Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Research & engineering 2.6 % 3.6 % 3.1 % General & administrative 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.4 % Research & engineering costs have decreased in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of Revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of cost control measures. Although Research & engineering costs increased as a percentage of Revenue in 2016 as compared to 2015, they decreased in absolute dollar terms as a result of cost control measures that were implemented, offset in part by the impact of the Cameron acquisition. 19 Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate was (27.9)% in 2017, 14.6% in 2016, and 25.9% in 2015. The Schlumberger effective tax rate has historically been sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increased, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreased. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreased, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally increased. The effective tax rate for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements because they were only partially tax-effective. Excluding the impact of these charges and credits, the effective tax rate was 18.2% in 2017, 15.9% in 2016 and 20.2% in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016, excluding the impact of charges and credits, was primarily attributable to a change in the geographic mix of earnings as the percentage of pretax earnings generated in North America increased. The decrease in the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of charges and credits, in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributed to the geographic mix of earnings and the favorable resolution of the tax examinations in certain jurisdictions. As discussed in further detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements , on December 22, 2017 the US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ). The Act, which is also commonly referred to as US tax reform , significantly changes US corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the US corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of US subsidiaries. Excluding the impact of any discrete items, the provisions of the Act are expected to reduce Schlumberger effective tax rate in 2018 by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points compared to what the rate would have otherwise been in the absence of US tax reform. The ultimate impact on Schlumberger effective tax rate will largely depend on the percentage of pretax earnings that Schlumberger generates in the US as compared to the rest of the world. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2017, 2016 and 2015. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The following is a summary of the 2017 charges and credits, of which $3.211 billion were classified as Impairments & other, $245 million were classified as Cost of sales and $308 million were classified as Merger & integration in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) : (Stated in millions) Noncontrolling Pretax Tax Interests Net Impairment & other WesternGeco seismic restructuring charges $ 1,114 $ 20 $ - $ 1,094 Venezuela investment write-down 938 - - 938 Promissory note fair value adjustment and other 510 - 12 498 Workforce reductions 247 13 - 234 Multiclient seismic data impairment 246 81 - 165 Other restructuring charges 156 10 22 124 Cost of sales - - Provision for loss on long-term construction project 245 22 - 223 Merger & integration - - Merger and integration-related costs 308 70 - 238 US tax reform charge - (76 ) - 76 $ 3,764 $ 140 $ 34 $ 3,590 20 The following is a summary of the 2016 charges and credits, of which $3.172 billion were classified as Impairments & other, $349 million were classified as Merger & integration and $299 million were classified in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) : (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Impairment & other Workforce reductions $ 880 $ 69 $ 811 Other fixed asset impairments 684 52 632 Inventory write-downs 616 49 567 North America pressure pumping asset impairments 209 67 142 Multiclient seismic data impairment 198 62 136 Facility impairments 165 58 107 Facility closure costs 165 40 125 Costs associated with exiting certain activities 98 23 75 Currency devaluation loss in Egypt 63 - 63 Contract termination costs 39 9 30 Other restructuring charges 55 - 55 Merger & integration Other merger and integration-related 160 28 132 Merger-related employee benefits 83 13 70 Facility closure costs 61 13 48 Professional fees 45 10 35 Cost of sales Amortization of inventory fair value adjustment 299 90 209 $ 3,820 $ 583 $ 3,237 The following is a summary of the 2015 charges and credits, all of which were classified as Impairments & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) : (Stated in millions) Pretax Tax Net Workforce reductions $ 920 $ 107 $ 813 Fixed asset impairments 776 141 635 Inventory write-downs 269 27 242 Impairment of SPM project 182 36 146 Facility closures 177 37 140 Geopolitical events 77 - 77 Currency devaluation loss in Venezuela 49 - 49 Contract termination costs 41 2 39 Other 84 7 77 $ 2,575 $ 357 $ 2,218 21 Liquidity and Capital Resources Schlumberger had total Cash , Short-term investments and Fixed income investments, held to maturity of $5.1 billion, $9.5 billion and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total debt was $18.2 billion, $19.6 billion and $19.0 billion at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Details of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follows: (Stated in millions) Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Components of Liquidity: 2017 2016 2015 Cash $ 1,799 $ 2,929 $ 2,793 Short-term investments 3,290 6,328 10,241 Fixed income investments, held to maturity - 238 418 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (3,324 ) (3,153 ) (4,557 ) Long-term debt (14,875 ) (16,463 ) (14,442 ) Net debt (1) $ (13,110 ) $ (10,121 ) $ (5,547 ) Changes in Liquidity: 2017 2016 2015 Income (loss) from continuing operations before noncontrolling interests $ (1,513 ) $ (1,627 ) $ 2,135 Impairments and other charges 3,764 3,820 2,575 Depreciation and amortization (2) 3,837 4,094 4,078 Earnings of equity method investments, less dividends received (56 ) (60 ) (125 ) Pension and other postretirement benefits expense 104 187 438 Stock-based compensation expense 343 267 326 Pension and other postretirement benefits funding (133 ) (174 ) (346 ) Decrease (increase) in working capital (3) (823 ) 416 (478 ) US Federal tax refund 685 - - Other (545 ) (662 ) 202 Cash flow from operations 5,663 6,261 8,805 Capital expenditures (2,107 ) (2,055 ) (2,410 ) SPM investments (1,609 ) (1,031 ) (953 ) Multiclient seismic data capitalized (276 ) (630 ) (486 ) Free cash flow (4) 1,671 2,545 4,956 Dividends paid (2,778 ) (2,647 ) (2,419 ) Proceeds from employee stock plans (969 ) 415 448 Stock repurchase program 297 (778 ) (2,182 ) (1,779 ) (465 ) 803 Business acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired plus debt assumed (847 ) (4,022 ) (478 ) Discontinued operations - settlement with U.S. Department of Justice - - (233 ) Other (363 ) (87 ) (252 ) Increase in Net Debt (2,989 ) (4,574 ) (160 ) Net Debt, Beginning of period (10,121 ) (5,547 ) (5,387 ) Net Debt, End of period $ (13,110 ) $ (10,121 ) $ (5,547 ) 22 (1) Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger indebtedness by refl ecting cash and investments that could be used to repay d ebt. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, total debt. ( 2 ) Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and SPM investments. ( 3 ) Includes severance payments of approximately $455 during 2017, $850 million during 2016 and $810 million during 2015. ( 4 ) Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, SPM investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operations. Key liquidity events during 2017, 2016 and 2015 included: Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion in 2017, $6.3 billion in 2016 and $8.8 billion in 2015. The decrease in operating cash flows for each of the last two years is largely attributable to lower earnings before non-cash charges and credits and depreciation and amortization expense. Schlumberger paid $2.8 billion of cash in connection with its acquisition of Cameron. Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Cameron, Schlumberger assumed $3.0 billion of debt (including a $244 million adjustment to increase Cameron long-term fixed rate debt to its estimated fair value) and acquired $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the second quarter of 2016, Schlumberger repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of Cameron long-term fixed-rate debt. In connection with Schlumberger acquisition of Cameron, Cameron merged with Schlumberger Holdings Corporation ( SHC ), an indirect wholly-owned United States subsidiary of Schlumberger. Under the terms of the agreement, Cameron shareholders received 0.716 shares of Schlumberger Limited common stock and a cash payment of $14.44 in exchange for each Cameron share of common stock outstanding. In connection with this transaction, SHC acquired approximately 138 million shares of common stock from Schlumberger Limited and transferred those shares to Cameron shareholders. In order to partially fund the purchase of the 138 million shares of common stock from Schlumberger Limited that were transferred to Cameron stockholders, SHC issued $6 billion of notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 consisting of the following: $500 million of 1.90% Senior Notes due 2017; $1.3 billion of 2.35% Senior Notes due 2018; $1.6 billion of 3.00% Senior Notes due 2020; $850 million of 3.63% Senior Notes due 2022; and $1.75 billion of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2025. On July 18, 2013, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018. This program was completed during May 2017. On January 21, 2016, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock. Schlumberger had repurchased $324 million under the new program as of December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2017, 2016 and 2015: (Stated in thousands, except per share amounts) Total Cost Total Number Average Price of Shares of Shares Paid per Purchased Purchased Share 2017 $ 968,676 13,249.7 $ 73.11 2016 $ 778,018 10,988.5 $ 70.80 2015 $ 2,182,180 26,751.0 $ 81.57 Dividends paid during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. 23 Capital expenditures were $ 2.1 billion in 201 7 , $ 2. 1 billion in 201 6 and $ 2.4 billion in 201 5 . Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 2.1 billion in 201 8 . During the fourth quarter of 2017, Schlumberger issued $0.5 billion of 2.20% Guaranteed Notes due 2020 and $0.6 billion of 2.65% Guaranteed Notes due 2022. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 Schlumberger made contributions of $133 million, $174 million and $346 million, respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. The US pension plans were 88% funded at December 31, 2017 and 85% funded at December 31, 2016 based on the projected benefit obligation. Schlumberger international defined benefit pension plans were a combined 97% funded at December 31, 2017 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 92% funded at December 31, 2016. Schlumberger expects to contribute approximately $125 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2018, subject to market and business conditions. The increase in SPM investments in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to the purchase of a majority non-operating interest in the Palliser Block, located in Alberta, Canada, from Cenovous Energy, an integrated Canadian oil company. Schlumberger maintains a 5.0 billion Guaranteed Euro Medium Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. Schlumberger has issued 0.5 billion 1.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2019 under this program. As of December 31, 2017, Schlumberger had $5.1 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger also has separate committed credit facility agreements aggregating $6.6 billion with commercial banks, of which $3.6 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2017. The $6.6 billion of committed credit facility agreements included $6.3 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper programs. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months. The total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2016.

(3) Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 18, Pension and Other Benefit Plans, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017 is approximately $1.4 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. 24 Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are cu stomary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data Schlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $727 million and $1.07 billion, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, surveys are primarily analyzed for impairment on a survey-by-survey basis. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. As a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, Schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable. During weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, Schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables. However, except as described below, Schlumberger has not had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn. Schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries. As of December 31, 2017, only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger net receivables balance, of which only one (the United States) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables. During the second quarter of 2017, Schlumberger entered into a financing agreement with its primary customer in Venezuela. This agreement resulted in the exchange of $700 million of outstanding accounts receivable for promissory notes with a three-year term that bear interest at the rate of 6.50% per annum. Schlumberger recorded these notes at their estimated fair value on the date of the exchange, which resulted in a pretax and after-tax charge of $460 million. As a result, the cost basis of the promissory note was $240 million as of June 30, 2017. In April 2016, Schlumberger announced that it was reducing its activity in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments on outstanding receivables. Schlumberger also previously disclosed that its judgment regarding the collectibility of its receivables and promissory notes in Venezuela is sensitive to the political and economic conditions in the country and that, if conditions in Venezuela worsen, Schlumberger may be required to record adjustments to the carrying value of these assets. During the fourth quarter of 2017, conditions in Venezuela further deteriorated such that Schlumberger determined it was appropriate to write-off the remaining outstanding receivable balance of approximately $469 million and record an impairment charge of $105 million related to the aforementioned promissory notes, in order to write-down the cost basis of such notes to their estimated fair value as of December 31, 2017. 25 Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference. Schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill, Schlumberger reporting units are its four Groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, Production and Cameron. Schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2017. Based on this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets and investments in SPM projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Income Taxes Schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Percentage-of-Completion Revenue Recognition Schlumberger uses the percentage-of-completion method to account for certain long-term construction-type contracts. These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications. Under the percentage-of-completion method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project. Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims. Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete. Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable. 26 Approximately 7 % of Schlumberger revenue in 201 7 was recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate that Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan was 3.70% at December 31, 2017 and 4.20% at December 31, 2016. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger international pension plans was 3.55% at December 31, 2017 and 4.13% at December 31, 2016. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plan decreased from 4.50% in 2016 to 4.20% in 2017. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger international pension plans decreased from 4.36% in 2016 to 4.13% in 2017. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expected rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 7.25% in both 2017 and 2016. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 7.40% in both 2017 and 2016. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2017 postretirement medical expense was 7.25% graded to 5.0% over the next nine years. The overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at December 31, 2017 was 7.25% graded to 5.0% over the next nine years. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States and international pension plan: (Stated in millions) Effect on 2017 Effect on Pretax Pension Dec. 31, 2017 Change in Assumption Expense Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$40 +$550 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$37 -$518 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets +$27 - 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets -$26 - 27 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Effect on 2017 Effect on Pretax Pension Dec. 31, 2017 Change in Assumption Expense Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate - +$45 25 basis point increase in discount rate - -$42 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate -$3 -$35 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate +$3 +$34
