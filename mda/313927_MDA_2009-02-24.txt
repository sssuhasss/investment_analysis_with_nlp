ITEM 7. M ANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements. Overview The Company develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products. It recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands, including ARM & HAMMER and TROJAN, to consumers through supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers; and to industrial customers and distributors. The Company operates in three primary segments, Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products. The Consumer Domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing such as ARM & HAMMER baking soda and cat litter products; laundry and cleaning products, such as XTRA and ARM & HAMMER laundry detergents, OXICLEAN pre-wash laundry additive, SCRUB FREE, KABOOM, ORANGE GLO and BRILLO cleaning products; and personal care products, such as TROJAN condoms, ORAJEL oral analgesics, NAIR depilatories and waxes, FIRST RESPONSE and ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID and ARM & HAMMER antiperspirant and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes. Our Consumer International segment sells a variety of personal care, and to a lesser extent household, products, some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines, in international markets, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil and China. Our Specialty Products ( SPD ) segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, our Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products segments represented approximately 71%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of net sales. On February 29, 2008, the Company sold its wholly-owned British subsidiary, Brotherton Speciality Products Ltd. ( Brotherton ) for a total of $11.2 million, net of fees. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $3.0 million, which was included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses in the Specialty Products Segment. On June 5, 2008, the Company announced plans to construct a new integrated laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution center in York County, Pennsylvania. Construction began in September 2008, and the facility is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2009. In conjunction with the opening of the new facility, the Company will close its existing laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey. The Company existing North Brunswick complex is comprised of five separate buildings, which have resulted in significant inefficiencies and cannot accommodate expansion to address expected future growth. The Company plans to provide severance and transition benefits to approximately 300 affected employees at the North Brunswick complex, as well as consideration for employment opportunities at other Company operations. On July 7, 2008, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Del Laboratories, Inc. (the Orajel Acquisition ) for $383.4 million. In connection with the acquisition, the Company increased its bank debt by $250.0 million. The balance of the acquisition cost ($133.4 million including fees) was funded with available cash. The terms and conditions of the additional borrowing are consistent with those of the Company existing bank debt. On August 29, 2008, the Company sold its Consumer International subsidiary in Spain for a total of $6.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pretax charge of $3.5 million, which has been recorded in SG&A expense for the Consumer International segment. As a result of the sale, a $4.0 million tax benefit also was recorded as a reduction to tax expense. 24 Table of Contents The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the Company results of operations commencing with their respective acquisition dates. Continuing a trend that began in 2005, the cost of raw materials was substantially higher in 2008, although by the end of 2008 the cost of many of these raw materials retreated from mid-year highs. Despite a second half reduction in cost of many raw materials, the cost of soda ash, surfactants, diesel fuel, corrugated paper, liner board and oil-based raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all higher at the end of 2008 than the prior year average. Moreover, the price of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), which generally fluctuates with the price of global vegetable oil, was substantially higher in 2008, although it too had eased off of mid-year highs by the end of the year. The Company offset these increases in 2008 through savings realized in cost improvement programs and price increases on many of its products. Despite a second half reduction in the cost of most commodities, some commodities continued to rise in price. Additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could further materially impact the Company costs and financial results if the Company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers. The Company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets, in which cost efficiency, new product offerings and innovation are critical to success. The consumer products markets are particularly mature in North America and are characterized by high household penetration, particularly with respect to the Company most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care. Furthermore, because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers, the Company faces pricing pressure from these customers, particularly the high-volume retail store customers, who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. To protect its existing market share or to capture additional market share, the Company increased expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduced new products and line extensions. In order to fund the additional marketing expenses, the Company has and continues to pursue ongoing cost cutting initiatives. As a result of its acquisitions and cost improvement initiatives, the Company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions has affected demand for many products. Factors that can affect demand include rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. While the Company products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, they may become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue. Moreover, some of our products, such as laundry additives and battery operated toothbrushes, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending. Some of our customers, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores, wholesale clubs, pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance, which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all. In response, we conducted a review of the financial strength of our key customers during the fourth quarter of 2008, and we continue to monitor these customers. As appropriate, we modified customer credit limits, which may have an adverse impact on future sales. We have conducted a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations. Where appropriate, we intend to identify alternate sources of materials and services. To date, we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers. However, a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales. In addition many of our trade customers sell products under their own private label brand which compete with products that we sell. As consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during these difficult economic times, our trade customers may discontinue or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase their less expensive private label products. To the extent some of our products are discontinued or are adversely affected by our trade customers actions to increase shelf space for their private label products, we are focusing our efforts on improving distribution with other customers. Our Company results could be adversely affected if our efforts are not effective. 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. They are based on our historical experience, our observation of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves Virtually all of the Company revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $0.8 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the Company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $6.0 million. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $4.0 million, $5.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively based on actual experience and updated information. Impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . The Company impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. 26 Table of Contents The Company recognized tradename impairment charges within selling, general and administrative expenses for the three year period ended December 31, 2008 as follows (in millions): Segments: 2008 2007 2006 Consumer Domestic $ 1.9 $ $ 11.0 Consumer International 3.8 4.2 3.3 Total $ 5.7 $ 4.2 $ 14.3 The tradename impairment charges recorded in 2008 were a result of management decision to exit a business, a potential change of a brand name, lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability. The impairment charges in 2007 and 2006 are also due to lost distribution at key customer accounts and reduced profitability. The amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair value was estimated based on a relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future. Under this method, the owner of an intangible asset must determine the arm length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license that asset from a third party. In addition, the carrying amount of amortizable tradenames declined during 2008 due to the sale of the Company subsidiary in Spain. The Company determined that the remaining carrying value of all tradenames was recoverable based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of Company assets and liabilities. The analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company recognized charges related to equipment obsolescence, which occur in the ordinary course of business, and plant impairment charges during the three year period ended December 31, 2008 as follows (in millions): Segments: 2008 2007 2006 Consumer Domestic $ 3.4 $ 2.8 $ 1.7 Consumer International 0.1 0.4 0.5 SPD 0.1 0.1 0.3 Total $ 3.6 $ 3.3 $ 2.5 The estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. Future outcomes may also differ materially from management estimates. If the Company products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. 27 Table of Contents Inventory valuation When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose). The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is needed. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company products, technological changes, and new product introductions. In addition, the Company allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units ( SKUs ). The Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $10.7 million at December 31, 2008, and $9.7 million at December 31, 2007. Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs The Company pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the Company pension plans and postretirement plans, the Company refers to an applicable index and expected cash flows to select a rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled. Based on the published rate as of December 31, 2008 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans, the Company used a discount rate of 6.25% for its domestic plan. The Company weighted average discount rate for all pension plans as of December 31, 2008 is 6.58% as compared to 5.98% used at December 31, 2007. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the Company weighted average expected long-term rate for 2008 was 7.21%, an increase of 2 basis points from the 7.19% rate used in 2007. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in less than a $0.5 million change in pension expense for 2009. As noted above, changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs. In 2008, other comprehensive income reflected a $14.6 million increase in pension plan obligations and a $0.3 million decrease for postretirement benefit plans. The change to the pension plans is primarily related to the reduction in plan assets, which were affected by the worldwide economic crisis and the decline in the securities markets. The change to postretirement plans is due to the change in discount rate at the Company Canadian facility. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $14.6 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2008. The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately $4.6 million in 2009. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely 28 Table of Contents than not to be realized. The Company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ). The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities. The Company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate. Recent Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , was issued in September 2006 and, except as noted below, is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 provides a single definition of fair value to be utilized under other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Under FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, the FASB deferred for one year, the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosure, SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs (generally, assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability) used to measure fair value based on the quality and reliability of the information provided by the inputs, as follows: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for the Company fair value measurement disclosures. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141(R) ), to replace SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS 141(R) requires use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer on the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date the acquirer obtains control and broadens the scope of SFAS No. 141 to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 with earlier adoption prohibited. While the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 141(R) to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements for transactions completed prior to December 31, 2008, the impact of the accounting change could be material for business combinations which may be consummated thereafter. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The statement is effective as of January 1, 2009. This statement requires enhanced disclosures about (i) how and why the Company uses derivative instruments, (ii) how the Company accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company financial results. The Company currently is evaluating the impact of this statement on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies and categorizes the order of priority of the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC approval of the Public Company Accounting 29 Table of Contents Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-6-1). FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarified that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. Awards of this nature are considered participating securities and the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share must be applied to these awards. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. ( EITF ) 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity Own Stock (EITF 07-5). EITF 07-5 provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock, including evaluating the instrument contingent exercise and settlement provisions. It also provides guidance on the impact of foreign currency denominated strike prices and market-based employee stock option valuation instruments on the evaluation. EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of EITF 07-5 on its consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment. The discussion of the Company consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information. The Company reporting units are consistent with its reportable segments. Consolidated results 2008 compared to 2007 Net Sales Net Sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $2,422.4 million, an increase of $201.5 million or 9.1% above 2007 net sales. Of the increase, 1.6% is due to sales of products acquired in the Orajel Acquisition, partially offset by the loss of sales due to the divestiture in the first quarter of 2008 of Brotherton Speciality Products, Ltd. ( Brotherton ), a United Kingdom Specialty Products subsidiary and the third quarter 2008 divestiture of the Company consumer products subsidiary in Spain. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact for the full 2008 year. The remainder of the increase is approximately equally attributable to higher volumes and higher selling prices. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $971.7 million during 2008, a $103.8 million increase as compared to 2007. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 40.1% as compared to 39.1% in 2007. The increase in gross margin reflects price increases, cost reduction programs, the effect of the liquid laundry detergent concentration, the higher margins associated with the sales of products relating to the Orajel Acquisition, and the completion of the manufacturing synergies relating to the businesses acquired from Orange Glo International, Inc. ( OGI ) in 2006. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity costs and hedging losses due to declining diesel prices. In addition, the gross profit increase was partially offset by $10.2 million related to the decision to close an existing manufacturing facility (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). 30 Table of Contents Marketing expenses for 2008 were $294.1 million, an increase of $37.4 million as compared to 2007. The increase principally was directed to acquired businesses and certain household products. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for 2008 were $337.3 million, an increase of $31.1 million as compared to 2007, but unchanged as a percent of net sales. The primary reasons for the increase in SG&A were operating expenses related to the Orajel Acquisition, $5.7 million of tradename impairment charges, exit costs associated with selling the Company subsidiary in Spain, higher legal costs including litigation against Abbott Laboratories (see paragraph g in Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), higher research and development costs in support of new products and higher selling expenses in support of higher sales. The current year increase was partially offset by the $3.0 million gain recorded on the divestiture of Brotherton. The prior year results include a $3.3 million gain on the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary and intangible asset impairment charges of $4.2 million. Other Income and Expenses In 2008, equity in earnings of affiliates was $11.3 million as compared to $8.2 million in 2007, primarily associated with improved profitability of Armand Products. Other expense was approximately $3.2 million in 2008 as compared to other income of $2.5 million in 2007. The changes in both years principally reflect foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest expense in 2008 decreased by $11.9 million as compared to 2007. The decline was due to lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding compared to the prior year. In July 2008, the Company incurred additional indebtedness as a result of the Orajel Acquisition; however, this indebtedness was offset by reductions in indebtedness resulting from the conversion of all but a nominal amount of the Company convertible debt into common stock in the third quarter of 2008, the reduction of most of the outstanding amounts under of the Company accounts receivable securitization facility and mandatory repayments under the Company term loan. Taxation The 2008 tax rate was 36.7% as compared to 36.2% in 2007. The 2008 tax rate reflects higher U.S. taxable income, a higher state tax rate and non-deductible losses in Company owned life insurance, partially offset by a tax benefit of $4.0 million related to the divestiture of the subsidiary in Spain. The 2007 tax rate reflects a charge of $3.2 million, relating to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for one of the Company foreign subsidiaries and also reflects a $1.8 million benefit due to the reduction of tax liabilities in the U.K. and Australia. Consolidated results 2007 compared to 2006 Net Sales Net Sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2,220.9 million, $275.3 million or 14.1% above last year. The increase is largely due to the impact of the acquisition of the businesses formerly owned by Orange Glo International, Inc. (the OGI Acquisition ), which occurred in August 2006, and the SPINBRUSH toothbrush business, which collectively accounted for approximately 8% of the increase in net sales; the effect of foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately 1% of the increase. The balance of the increase is a result of unit volume increases partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses. Following the acquisition of the SPINBRUSH business in December 2005 and during the transition period prior to April 1, 2006, the seller of the SPINBRUSH business maintained responsibility for sales and other functions in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; therefore, the Company accounted for the net cash received as other revenue. The Company assumed 31 Table of Contents responsibility for all SPINBRUSH functions in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. on April 1, 2006, and has recognized the gross amount of sales and expenses from the SPINBRUSH business for the U.S. and foreign locations since that date. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $867.9 million during 2007, a $106.8 million increase as compared to 2006. The Company gross margin remained unchanged at 39.1% compared to 2006. Gross profit reflects the impact of the OGI business, higher sales volume and foreign exchange rates, offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses. Gross profit also includes the impact of continuing price increases for resins, corrugated paper, liner board, soda ash, diesel fuel, palm fatty acid distillate ( PFAD ) and other raw materials, offset by cost reduction programs. Marketing expenses for 2007 were $256.7 million, an increase of $40.1 million as compared to 2006. The increase principally was due to support acquired businesses, an increase in expenses for certain personal care products and the effect of foreign exchange rates. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) for 2007 were $306.1 million, an increase of $13.7 million as compared to 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher selling expenses in support of higher sales, ongoing costs to support the acquired OGI business, higher information systems costs, higher legal expense, costs to reorganize the Company Canadian subsidiary and the effect of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a $3.3 million gain associated with the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by lower intangible asset impairment charges in 2007 of $4.2 million, as compared to $14.3 million in 2006. Other Income and Expenses In 2007, equity in earnings of affiliates was $8.2 million as compared to $7.1 million in 2006. The increase is primarily due to the earnings of the Esseco U.K. LLP joint venture which was started in April 2006 and improved profitability of Armand products. Other income was approximately $2.5 million in 2007 as compared to other expense of $2.6 million in 2006. Other income in both years principally reflect foreign exchange gains and losses. Also, in 2006, other income/expense included the fair market value of common stock the Company received in connection with the demutualization of an insurance company in which the Company was the policyholder of a guaranteed annuity contract associated with a defined benefit plan. Interest expense in 2007 increased $4.9 million as compared to 2006. This increase reflects expense associated with the debt used to finance the OGI acquisition in August 2006, partially offset by lower bank debt due to mandatory and voluntary debt payments. Investment earnings increased $2.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of higher cash available for investment. Taxation The 2007 tax rate was 36.2% as compared to 34.8% in 2006. The 2007 tax rate reflects a charge of $3.2 million, relating to a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for one of the Company foreign subsidiaries and also reflects a $1.8 million benefit due to the reduction of tax liabilities in the U.K. and Australia. The effective tax rate in 2006 reflects a $3.3 million reduction of tax liabilities primarily as a result of the completion of tax audits, offset by a valuation allowance of $1.5 million on deferred tax assets for one of the Company foreign subsidiaries. 32 Table of Contents Segment results for 2008, 2007 and 2006 The Company maintains three reportable segments. These segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. Specifically, the Company has identified the following segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products Division ( SPD ). The Company also has a Corporate segment. Segment revenues are derived from the sale of the following products: Segment Products Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products Consumer International Primarily personal care products Specialty Products Specialty chemical products The Company had 50% ownership interests in Armand Products Company ( Armand ) and The ArmaKleen Company ( ArmaKleen ) as of December 31, 2008. The Company 50% ownership interest in Esseco U.K. LLP ( Esseco ) was divested in the first quarter of 2008 as part of the sale of Brotherton. The equity in earnings of Armand and ArmaKleen for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and Esseco for the two months ended February 29, 2008 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, is included in the Corporate segment. Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment. These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results set forth below. The domestic results of operations for the OGI business and the businesses acquired in the Orajel Acquisition are included in the Consumer Domestic segment. The results of operations for the OGI business and Orajel Acquisition foreign operations are included in the Consumer International segment. Segment sales and income before taxes and minority interest for each of the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows; (Dollars in thousands) Consumer Domestic (3) Consumer International (3) SPD Corporate Total Net Sales (1) 2008 $ 1,716,801 $ 420,192 $ 285,405 $ $ 2,422,398 2007 1,563,895 398,521 258,524 2,220,940 2006 1,382,223 343,145 220,293 1,945,661 Income Before Taxes & Minority Interest (2) 2008 $ 236,956 $ 34,635 $ 25,335 $ 11,334 $ 308,260 2007 205,688 34,656 16,351 8,236 264,931 2006 164,732 27,063 14,164 7,135 213,094 (1) Intersegment sales from Consumer International to Consumer Domestic were $5.2 million, $5.0 million and $6.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. (2) In determining Income Before Minority Interest and Income Taxes, interest expense, investment earnings, and other income (expense) were allocated to the segments based upon each segment relative operating profit. The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings of affiliates. (3) As of January 1, 2008, the Company modified its organizational structure, resulting in a change in classification of certain Consumer Domestic export sales to Consumer International. Therefore, 2007 and 2006 results have been restated to reflect a reclassification in sales of $10.2 million and $6.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, from the Consumer Domestic segment to the Consumer International segment. In addition, Income Before Minority Interest and 33 Table of Contents Income Taxes of $1.5 million and $1.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, has been reclassified from the Consumer Domestic segment to the Consumer International segment. Product line revenues for external customers for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (In thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Household Products $ 1,081,440 $ 991,141 $ 826,680 Personal Care Products 635,361 572,754 555,543 Total Consumer Domestic 1,716,801 1,563,895 1,382,223 Total Consumer International 420,192 398,521 343,145 Total SPD 285,405 258,524 220,293 Total Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,422,398 $ 2,220,940 $ 1,945,661 Consumer Domestic 2008 compared to 2007 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2008 were $1,716.8 million, an increase of $152.9 million or 9.8% as compared to 2007 sales of $1,563.9 million . Of the increase, approximately 3% relates to sales of products acquired in the Orajel Acquisition, with the remainder mostly attributable to higher unit volumes and the balance due to higher prices. At a product line level, sales of XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN, ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent and ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter were all higher than 2007. Consumer Domestic net sales also benefited from February 2008 price increases on condoms and baking soda and the May 2008 price increases on ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent. The Company also implemented several price increases in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2008, including ARM & HAMMER Liquid Laundry Detergent, XTRA Liquid Laundry Detergent, OXICLEAN Powder, SPINBRUSH and ARM & HAMMER Dental Care. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of KABOOM household cleaner, certain toothpaste brands and antiperspirants. Consumer Domestic Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes for 2008 was $237.0 million, a $31.3 million increase as compared to 2007. The impact of higher net sales, synergies related to the manufacturing integration of the OGI business, the shift to concentrated liquid laundry detergent, the Orajel Acquisition and lower allocated interest expense, was partially offset by accelerated depreciation and other expenses associated with the Company planned 2009 shutdown of its North Brunswick New Jersey facility (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report), higher commodity, marketing and SG&A costs and hedging losses due to declining diesel prices. 2007 compared to 2006 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2007 were $1,563.9 million, an increase of $181.7 million or approximately 13% compared to 2006. The increase is primarily due to the OGI acquisition, which contributed approximately 9% of the increase, and higher unit volume, partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses in support of new product launches. Sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, which include sales for the first phase of the Company shift to concentrated liquid detergent, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter, TROJAN condoms, ARM & HAMMER Dental Care and pregnancy test kits were all higher than in 2006. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of other toothpaste brands and antiperspirant sales. Consumer Domestic Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes in 2007 was $205.7 million, an increase of $40.9 million as compared to 2006. Profits resulting from the OGI business and higher volumes were partially offset by higher trade promotion, slotting expenses and marketing costs on pre-existing products, higher SG&A expenses, and higher interest expense resulting from the OGI acquisition. 34 Table of Contents Consumer International 2008 compared to 2007 Consumer International net sales were $420.2 million in 2008, an increase of $21.7 million or approximately 5.4% as compared to 2007. The increase includes the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates of 1.5%, higher unit volumes in Canada, England, Australia and higher U.S. exports, partially offset by lower sales in France and the impact of divesting the subsidiary in Spain. Consumer International Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes was $34.6 million in 2008, unchanged as compared to 2007. Offsetting the favorable net sales performance and lower allocated interest expense were asset impairment charges of $5.9 million, severance and contract termination costs in one of the Company European subsidiaries, increased tradename amortization expense as a result of the recharacterization of certain indefinite lived assets to finite lived assets (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report) and the $3.5 million pre tax loss on the sale of the Company Spanish subsidiary in 2008. In addition, 2007 reflects a gain of $3.3 million on the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary. 2007 compared to 2006 Consumer International net sales in 2007 were $398.5 million, an increase of $55.4 million, or approximately 16% as compared to 2006. Of the increase, approximately 3% is associated with the OGI and SPINBRUSH acquisitions, 8% is associated with favorable foreign exchange rates and the balance is associated with higher sales of personal care and household products in Canada, skin care and oral care products in France, skin care products in Australia, oral care products in the UK and depilatory products in Brazil and a reduction of promotion reserves of $2.9 million, based upon updated information including actual expense, partially offset by reduced sales resulting from the loss of a distribution arrangement to sell certain personal care products in the UK. Consumer International Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes in 2007 was $34.7 million, a $7.6 million increase as compared to 2006. The increase is a result of higher profits associated with sales in Canada, France, Australia and Brazil, and the contribution from the OGI business. Results in 2007 include a $3.3 million gain associated with the sale of certain property owned by the Company Canadian subsidiary offset by tradename impairment charges of $4.2 million and a $3.5 million charge relating to the reorganization of the Company Canadian business. Intangible asset impairment charges were $3.3 million in 2006. Specialty Products 2008 compared to 2007 Specialty Products net sales were $285.4 million in 2008, an increase of $26.9 million or 10.4% as compared to 2007. This increase is principally due to higher prices. The animal nutrition sales increase also reflects a pricing surcharge on certain products first applied during 2007 to recover extraordinary cost increases for a key raw material. Partially offsetting the sales increase was the impact of divesting the Company Brotherton subsidiary. Specialty Products Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes was $25.3 million in the 2008, an increase of $9.0 million as compared to 2007. The increase is principally the result of profits on higher net sales and the $3.0 million gain on the sale of Brotherton, partially offset by higher raw material costs for certain animal nutrition and specialty chemical products and higher SG&A. 2007 compared to 2006 Specialty Products net sales were $258.5 million in 2007, an increase of $38.2 million, or 17% as compared to 2006. The increase is due to higher unit volumes and improved pricing in both animal nutrition and specialty 35 Table of Contents chemicals. The animal nutrition sales increase also reflects a pricing surcharge of $3.5 million enacted during the third quarter of 2007 on certain products which partially recover extraordinary cost increases for PFAD. Specialty Products Income before Minority Interest and Income Taxes was $16.4 million in 2007, an increase of $2.2 million as compared to 2006. The increase is principally the result of profits on higher net sales, partially offset by higher PFAD and soda ash costs. Liquidity and capital resources As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $198.0 million in cash, $114.0 million available through its $115.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, approximately $95.0 million available under its $100.0 million revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million accordion feature associated with the term loan. To ensure the safety of its cash resources, the Company invests its cash primarily in government agency money market funds. The Company renewed its accounts receivable securitization facility in February 2009. For the past several years, this facility has been renewed annually, and the Company anticipates that this facility will be renewed in February 2010. To date, the Company believes that its ability to access the sources of cash described above has not been adversely affected by recent economic events. Therefore, the Company currently does not anticipate that the credit environment will have a material adverse effect on its ability to address its current and forecasted liquidity requirements. The Company anticipates that its cash from operations, along with its current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs (including the cash requirements related to construction of its new laundry detergent and warehouse facility in York County, Pennsylvania, discussed in this section under Net Cash Used in Investing Activities ), pay its common stock dividend at current rates and meet its mandatory debt repayment schedule and minimum pension funding requirements over the next twelve months. Nevertheless, the current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences that the Company does not currently anticipate will occur. For further information, see Economic conditions could adversely affect our business under Risk Factors in Item 1A. In addition, the Company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenants in its principal credit facilities because the Company currently is, and anticipates that it will continue to be, well above the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement and below the maximum leverage ratio requirement. These ratios are discussed in more detail in this section under the sub-heading, Adjusted EBITDA. Net Debt The Company had outstanding total debt of $856.1 million and cash and cash equivalents of $198.0 million (of which approximately $37.3 million resides in foreign subsidiaries) at December 31, 2008. Total debt less cash ( net debt ) was $658.1 million at December 31, 2008. This compares to total debt of $856.0 million and cash and cash equivalents of $249.8 million, resulting in net debt of $606.2 million at December 31, 2007. Cash Flow Analysis (In thousands) Year Ending December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 336,167 $ 248,677 $ 186,444 Net cash used in investing activities (466,161 ) (42,522 ) (385,516 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 87,222 (73,619 ) 177,653 36 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased $87.5 million to $336.2 million as compared to $248.7 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to working capital improvements, higher net income, and higher non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization asset impairments and the diesel hedge loss, partially offset by the gain recorded on the sale of Brotherton (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report) and a lower benefit from deferred income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the components of working capital that significantly affected cash from operating activities are as follows: Accounts receivable decreased $26.5 million due to improved cash collections relating to higher sales. Accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased $10.0 million primarily due to the recording of litigation accruals. Taxes payable increased $5.1 million due to higher tax expense associated with higher earnings. Other liabilities decreased $7.8 million primarily due to contributions in 2008 of $14.6 million to the Company pension plans. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2008 was $466.2 million, reflecting $383.4 million paid for the Orajel Acquisition, $98.3 million of property, plant and equipment (including $51.0 million for the York County plant, discussed in the following paragraph), partially offset by $15.6 million received from the sale of Brotherton and the Company subsidiary in Spain. On June 5, 2008, the Company announced plans to construct a new laundry detergent manufacturing plant and distribution center in York County, Pennsylvania and to close its existing laundry detergent manufacturing and distribution facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in connection with construction of the new facility, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2009, will be approximately $150 million, and cash expenditures relating to the closing of the North Brunswick facilities will be approximately $11 million. The Company spent $51 million in 2008 and anticipates spending $100 million in 2009 to build the plant and distribution center. The Company estimates it also will spend approximately $3 million in 2009 and the remaining $8.0 million primarily in 2010 in connection with closing the North Brunswick facility. The costs will be funded using the Company existing credit facilities and available cash. See Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during 2008 was $87.2 million. This reflects borrowings of $250.0 million for the Orajel Acquisition offset by a $114.0 million repayment under the Company accounts receivable securitization facility and mandatory payments on its principal credit facility of $38.2 million. Payments of cash dividends of $23.1 million and deferred financing payments of $8.4 million were offset partially by proceeds of and tax benefits from stock option exercises of $19.0 million. The Company entered into two cash flow hedge agreements, each covering $100.0 million of zero cost collars, one effective as of September 29, 2006, and the other effective as of December 29, 2006, to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its term loan debt. The hedge agreements have terms of five and three years, respectively, each with a cap of 6.50% and a floor of 3.57%. The Company recorded a charge to interest expense of $0.9 million in 2008 and estimates it will recognize approximately $3.2 million in interest expense in the next twelve months. Changes in the hedging options fair value are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. The Company called for redemption on August 15, 2008 (the Redemption Date ) of all of its outstanding 5.25% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2033 (the Debentures ) at 101.50% of the principal amount of the Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. In lieu of surrendering the Debentures for cash redemption, holders could elect to convert their Debentures into shares of the Company common stock at the conversion rate of 32.26 shares of the Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures 37 Table of Contents (equivalent to a conversion price of $31.00 per share). Holders of $99.9 million principal amount of the Debentures that were outstanding when the Debentures were called for redemption converted their Debentures into 3,222,293 shares of Company common stock, and on the Redemption Date, the Company redeemed the remaining nominal principal amount of Debentures for cash. On December 23, 2005, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) with a number of banks and other financial institutions. This amended and restated Credit Agreement initially provided for a five year Term Loan in a principal amount of $300.0 million, subject to an increase by up to an additional $250.0 million through an accordion feature upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, and continued the existing five year multi-currency revolving credit and letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million. On August 7, 2006, the Company existing bank credit facility was amended and increased by $250.0 million, which the Company used to fund the acquisition of the OGI business while maintaining the $250 million accordion feature. On June 3, 2008, the Company once again amended its Credit Facility, increasing the principal amount by $250 million, which was used to fund the Orajel Acquisition, while maintaining the $250 million accordion feature. Other matters addressed in the June 2008 amendment included, among other things, an extension of the term of the $100 million Revolving Credit from May 28, 2009 to August 31, 2012, as well as other capital expenditure related provisions associated with the new plant construction in York, PA. Specifically, permitted capital expenditures were $100.0 million in 2008 and will be $200.0 million in 2009, and $100.0 million, thereafter. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The term loan and the revolving loans bear interest under one of two rate options, selected by the Company, equal to (a) either (i) a eurocurrency rate (adjusted for any reserve requirements) ( Eurocurrency Rate ) or (ii) the greater of the prime rate, the secondary market rate for three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for any reserve requirements) plus the applicable FDIC assessment rate plus 1.0%, or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% ( Alternate Base Rate ), plus (b) an applicable margin. On the closing date of the June 2008 agreement, the applicable margin was (a) 0.75% for the Eurocurrency rate and (b) 0% for the alternate rate. The Company revolving loans are available for general corporate purposes. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statement for additional information. 38 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a required component of the financial covenants contained in the Company primary credit facility. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the Company ability to service its indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Financial covenants include a total debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, which if not met, could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the credit facility, if not remedied within a specified period of time. Adjusted EBITDA was $459.0 million for 2008. The leverage ratio (total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) was 1.9, which is below the maximum of 3.5 permitted under the credit facility, and the interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense) for 2008 was 9.8, which is above the minimum of 3.0 permitted under the credit facility. The Company obligations under the credit facility are secured by the assets of the Company. The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for 2008 is as follows: (In millions) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 336.2 Interest Expense 47.0 Current Income Tax Provision 97.9 Excess Tax Benefit on Stock Options Exercised 6.3 Change in Working Capital and Other Liabilities (34.9 ) Investment Income (6.7 ) Other 13.2 Adjusted EBITDA (per loan agreement) $ 459.0 Commitments as of December 31, 2008 The table below summarizes the Company material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008. (In thousands) Payments Due by Period Total 2009 2010 to 2011 2012 to 2013 After 2013 Short & Long-Term Debt Syndicated Financing Loans $ 602,893 $ 71,491 $ 334,739 $ 196,663 $ Senior Subordinated Notes 250,000 250,000 Securitization of A/R Facility 1,000 1,000 Debt due to International Banks 2,248 2,248 856,141 74,739 334,739 446,663 Interest on Fixed Rate Debt (1) 60,000 15,000 30,000 15,000 Operating Lease Obligations 94,738 21,261 30,613 16,862 26,002 Other Long-Term Liabilities Letters of Credit (2) 3,299 3,299 Surety/Performance Bonds 719 719 Pension Contributions (3) 4,568 4,568 Purchase Obligations (4) 106,653 72,712 33,941 Total $ 1,126,118 $ 192,298 $ 429,293 $ 478,525 $ 26,002 (1) Represents interest on the Company 6% senior subordinated notes due in 2012. The Company did not include interest expense on its variable rate debt as it cannot predict future interest rates. 39 Table of Contents (2) Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for items such as insurance claims in the event of the Company insolvency and one year of rent on a warehouse. (3) Pension contributions are based on actuarial assessments of government regulated employer funding requirements per plan. These requirements are not projected beyond one year since they fluctuate with the change in plan assets, assumptions and demographics. (4) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2008 for raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and do not represent total anticipated purchases. The Company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities as defined in FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , due to the uncertainty of the amount per period of payment. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has gross uncertain tax liabilities, including interest, of $40.7 million (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. OTHER ITEMS Market risk Concentration of Risk In each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, net sales to the Company largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates were 22%, 22% and 21%, respectively, of the Company total consolidated net sales. Interest Rate Risk The Company has total debt outstanding at December 31, 2008 of $856.1 million, of which $250.0 million or 29% carries a fixed rate of interest. The remaining debt balance is primarily comprised of $602.9 million in term loans under the Company principal credit facilities, $1.0 million outstanding under a receivables purchase agreement and $2.2 million in international debt. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings at December 31, 2008, excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees, was approximately 3%. The Company entered into two cash flow hedge agreements, each covering $100.0 million of zero cost collars, one effective as of September 29, 2006, and the other effective as of December 29, 2006, to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its term loan debt. The hedge agreements have terms of five and three years, respectively, each with a cap of 6.50% and a floor of 3.57%. The Company recorded a charge to interest expense of $0.9 million in 2008 and estimates it will recognize approximately $3.2 million in interest expense in the next twelve months. Changes in the hedging options fair value are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. If the variable rate on the Company floating rate debt outstanding on December 31, 2008 were to change by 100 basis points from the December 31, 2008 level, annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would change by approximately $4.0 million. Diesel Fuel Hedge The Company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products. These carriers charge the Company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases. In response to increasing fuel prices, and a concomitant increase in mileage surcharges, the Company entered into an agreement in January 2008 with a financial institution to hedge approximately 50% of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2008, 40 Table of Contents and an additional agreement in July 2008 to hedge approximately 20% of its notional diesel fuel requirements for 2009. It is the Company policy to use the hedges to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges, and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel. The hedge agreements are designed to add stability to the Company product costs, enabling the Company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in diesel fuel prices over the term of the contract. Because the diesel hedge agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the Company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements. The change in the market value of the hedge agreements resulted in a $4.5 million loss for 2008, which is reflected in cost of sales. The loss is related to the hedge contract for 2009, which was executed when diesel fuel was at close to record prices. Since July 2008, the price of diesel fuel has fallen, thus creating a liability. Fluctuating diesel fuel prices in 2009 will affect the value of the hedge agreement covering 2009. If future diesel prices were to change by $0.10 per gallon, the impact on the 2009 financial statements due to the hedge agreements would be approximately $0.2 million. Foreign Currency The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S. Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar/Chinese Yuan. The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the US Dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company Canadian subsidiary entered into three forward exchange contracts to protect the Company from the risk that dollar net cash inflows or outflows would be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. The contracts expire early in 2009. The face value of these contracts totaled $4.5 million. The contracts qualified for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133, and, therefore, changes in the fair value through the end of 2008 were marked to market and recorded as Other Comprehensive Income. The amount recorded was less than $0.1 million. The Company currently has intercompany loans with certain of its subsidiaries. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange accounting re-measurement gains and losses from these intercompany loans. The Company previously entered into several foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net accounting re-measurement exposure on these loans. Also during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company Brazilian subsidiary entered into a foreign exchange contract to protect a portion of its US dollar purchases. The contract expired in January 2009 and had a face value of $3.5 million. The contract did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore, the change in fair value through the end of 2008 of $0.3 million, was recorded in other income. Equity Derivatives The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in the liability to plan participants for contributions designated to notional investment in Company stock under the Company deferred compensation plan as a result of changes in quoted fair values. These contracts, which consist of cash settled call options in the amount of 128 thousand shares, covered approximately 71% of the notional shares in the plan and are marked to market through earnings. As a result of these contracts, the Company recognized income of approximately $0.2 million in 2008, $0.9 million in 2007, and $1.2 million in 2006, which reduced the total charge for deferred compensation included in SG&A expense.
