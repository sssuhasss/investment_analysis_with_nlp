Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW Background We are a public utility holding company whose indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in a 5,000-square mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that includes Houston; and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states. Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities. Business Segments In this Management Discussion, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and certain critical accounting policies. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject. Our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility. Our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Natural Gas Distribution business segment. A summary of our reportable business segments as of December 31, 2008 is set forth below: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers (REPs) serving over 2 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf Coast that has a population of approximately 5.6 million people and includes Houston. On behalf of REPs, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout CenterPoint Houston certificated service territory. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally-owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers and REPs. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation largest power markets. Transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Texas Utility Commission. Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business (Gas Operations), which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. 35 Table of Contents Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services CERC operations also include non-rate regulated retail and wholesale natural gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in the six states listed above as well as several other Midwestern and Eastern states. Interstate Pipelines CERC interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately 8,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. It also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and a combined working gas capacity of approximately 59 Bcf. It also owns a 10% interest in the Bistineau storage facility located in Bienville Parish, Louisiana, with the remaining interest owned and operated by Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP. Its storage capacity in the Bistineau facility is 8 Bcf of working gas with 100 million cubic feet per day of deliverability. Most storage operations are in north Louisiana and Oklahoma. Field Services CERC field services business owns and operates approximately 3,600 miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect, treat and process natural gas from approximately 150 separate systems located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Other Operations Our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Significant Events in 2008 and 2009 Hurricane Ike CenterPoint Houston electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result of Hurricane Ike, which struck the upper Texas coast early Saturday, September 13, 2008. The strong Category 2 storm initially left more than 90% of CenterPoint Houston more than 2 million metered customers without power, the largest outage in CenterPoint Houston 130-year history. Most of the widespread power outages were due to power lines damaged by downed trees and debris blown by Hurricane Ike winds. In addition, on Galveston Island and along the coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay, the storm surge and flooding from rains accompanying the storm caused significant damage or destruction of houses and businesses served by CenterPoint Houston. CenterPoint Houston estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities damaged as a result of Hurricane Ike will be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. As is common with electric utilities serving coastal regions, the poles, towers, wires, street lights and pole mounted equipment that comprise CenterPoint Houston transmission and distribution system are not covered by property insurance, but office buildings and warehouses and their contents and substations are covered by insurance that provides for a maximum deductible of $10 million. Current estimates are that total losses to property covered by this insurance were approximately $17 million. In addition to storm restoration costs, CenterPoint Houston lost approximately $17 million in revenue through December 31, 2008. Within the first 18 days after the storm, CenterPoint Houston had restored power to all customers capable of receiving it. 36 Table of Contents CenterPoint Houston has deferred the uninsured storm restoration costs as management believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory process. As a result, storm restoration costs did not affect our or CenterPoint Houston reported net income for 2008. As of December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston recorded an increase of $145 million in construction work in progress and $435 million in regulatory assets for restoration costs incurred through December 31, 2008. Approximately $73 million of these costs are based on estimates and are included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2008. Additional restoration costs will continue to be incurred in 2009. Assuming necessary enabling legislation is enacted by the Texas Legislature in the session that began in January 2009, CenterPoint Houston expects to seek a financing order from the Texas Utility Commission to obtain recovery of its storm restoration costs through the issuance of non-recourse securitization bonds similar to the storm recovery bonds issued by another Texas utility following the hurricanes that affected that utility service territories in 2005. Assuming those bonds are issued, CenterPoint Houston will recover the amount of storm restoration costs determined by the Texas Utility Commission to have been prudently incurred out of the bond proceeds, with the bonds being repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers. Alternatively, if securitization is not available, recovery of those costs would be sought through traditional regulatory mechanisms. Under its 2006 rate case settlement, CenterPoint Houston is entitled to seek an adjustment to rates in this situation, even though in most instances its rates are frozen until 2010. Gas Operations also suffered some damage to its system in Houston, Texas and in other portions of its service territory across Texas and Louisiana. As of December 31, 2008, Gas Operations has deferred approximately $4 million of costs related to Hurricane Ike for recovery as part of future natural gas distribution rate proceedings. Debt Financing Transactions Pursuant to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in September 2007, in February 2008 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued approximately $488 million in transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of 4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity dates in February 2020 and February 2023, respectively. Scheduled final payment dates are February 2017 and February 2020. Through issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston securitized transition property of approximately $483 million representing the remaining balance of the competition transition charge (CTC) adjusted to refund certain unspent environmental retrofit costs and to recover the amount of the fuel reconciliation settlement. In April 2008, we purchased $175 million principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 102% of their principal amount. Prior to the purchase, $100 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 7.75% and $75 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 8%. Depending on market conditions, we may remarket both series of bonds, at 100% of their principal amounts, in 2009. In April 2008, we called our 3.75% convertible senior notes for redemption on May 30, 2008. At the time of the announcement, the notes were convertible at the option of the holders, and substantially all of the notes were submitted for conversion on or prior to the May 30, 2008 redemption date. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued 16.9 million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately $532 million to settle conversions of approximately $535 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes. In May 2008, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.50%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the satisfaction of cash payment obligations in connection with conversions of our 3.75% convertible senior notes as discussed above. In May 2008, CERC Corp. issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and loans to or investments in affiliates. In November 2008, CERC replaced a receivables facility that had expired in October 2008 with a new receivables facility that expires in November 2009. Availability under the new facility ranges from $128 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. 37 Table of Contents In November 2008, CenterPoint Houston entered into a $600 million 364-day credit facility. The credit facility will terminate if bonds are issued to securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike and if those bonds are issued prior to the November 24, 2009 expiration of the facility. CenterPoint Houston expects to seek legislative and regulatory approval for the issuance of such bonds during 2009. In December 2008, CERC entered into an asset management agreement whereby it sold $110 million of its natural gas in storage and agreed to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas during the 2008-2009 winter heating season for payments totaling $114 million. This transaction was accounted for as a financing and, as of December 31, 2008, the consolidated financial statements reflect natural gas inventory of $75 million and a financing obligation of $75 million related to this transaction. In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds due in March 2014 with an interest rate of 7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ike. Equity Financing Transactions In 2008, we received proceeds of approximately $65 million from the sale of approximately 4.9 million common shares to our defined contribution plan and proceeds of approximately $13 million from the sale of approximately 0.9 million common shares to participants in our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. Interstate Pipeline Expansion The Southeast Supply Header (SESH) pipeline project, a joint venture between CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp., and Spectra Energy Corp., was placed into commercial service on September 6, 2008. This new 270-mile pipeline, which extends from the Perryville Hub, near Perryville, Louisiana, to an interconnection with the Gulf Stream Natural Gas System near Mobile, Alabama, has a maximum design capacity of approximately one Bcf per day. The pipeline represents a new source of natural gas supply for the Southeast United States and offers greater supply diversity to this region. Our share of SESH net construction costs is approximately $625 million. Outlook During 2008, economic conditions in the United States declined significantly, with several large bank failures and consolidations, large declines in the values of securities, disruptions in the capital markets, which made it difficult to raise debt and equity, and increased costs for capital when it was available. Many of the factors that led to the economic decline are continuing into 2009, but it is impossible to predict the impacts such events may have in the future. Although our businesses and the areas in which we serve have, to date, not been as significantly affected as some others, in 2008, we experienced substantial declines in the value of our pension plan assets as a result of the stock market declines. Disruptions in the bank and capital markets during the last two quarters of 2008 have led to higher borrowing costs and greater uncertainty regarding the ability to execute transactions in these markets. Although we cannot predict future performance, the decline in the value of our pension plan assets that occurred during 2008 will result in increased non-cash charges to pension plan expense in 2009, which will adversely impact earnings, and may also result in the need for us to make significant cash contributions to our pension plan subsequent to 2009. We also expect to experience higher borrowing costs and greater uncertainty in executing capital markets transactions if conditions in financial markets do not improve from their current state. To the extent the adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. The current low commodity prices for natural gas and other energy products may cause energy producers to scale back projects such as drilling new gas wells or constructing new facilities. Reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry. Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. 38 Table of Contents These factors may lead to reduced earnings during 2009, compared to 2008, if they continue significantly into 2009 or if the magnitude of the economic downturn increases beyond the impacts experienced in 2008. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: the resolution of the true-up components, including, in particular, the results of appeals to the courts regarding rulings obtained to date; state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments, including deregulation, re-regulation, environmental regulations, including regulations related to global climate change, and changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to the various aspects of our business; timely and appropriate legislative and regulatory actions allowing securitization or other recovery of costs associated with Hurricane Ike; timely and appropriate rate actions and increases, allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment; cost overruns on major capital projects that cannot be recouped in prices; industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas and natural gas liquids; the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas; the timing and extent of changes in natural gas basis differentials; weather variations and other natural phenomena; changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; actions by rating agencies; effectiveness of our risk management activities; inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers, including Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI); the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their other obligations to us, including indemnity obligations, or in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor; the outcome of litigation brought by or against us; our ability to control costs; the investment performance of our employee benefit plans; our potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which we cannot assure will be completed or will have the anticipated benefits to us; 39 Table of Contents acquisition and merger activities involving us or our competitors; and other factors we discuss under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions, except for per share amounts. Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Revenues $ 9,319 $ 9,623 $ 11,322 Expenses 8,274 8,438 10,049 Operating Income 1,045 1,185 1,273 Gain (Loss) on Time Warner Investment 94 (114 ) (139 ) Gain (Loss) on Indexed Debt Securities (80 ) 111 128 Interest and Other Finance Charges (470 ) (503 ) (466 ) Interest on Transition Bonds (130 ) (123 ) (136 ) Distribution from AOL Time Warner Litigation Settlement 32 Additional Distribution to ZENS Holders (27 ) Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates 6 16 51 Other Income, net 29 17 14 Income Before Income Taxes 494 594 725 Income Tax Expense (62 ) (195 ) (278 ) Net Income $ 432 $ 399 $ 447 Basic Earnings Per Share $ 1.39 $ 1.25 $ 1.33 Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.33 $ 1.17 $ 1.30 2008 Compared to 2007 Net Income. We reported net income of $447 million ($1.30 per diluted share) for 2008 compared to $399 million ($1.17 per diluted share) for the same period in 2007. The increase in net income of $48 million was primarily due to an $88 million increase in operating income, a $37 million decrease in interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, a $35 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related primarily to SESH and a $17 million increase in the gain on our indexed debt securities. These increases in net income were partially offset by an $83 million increase in income tax expense, a $25 million increase in the loss on our Time Warner investment and a $13 million increase in interest expense on transition bonds. Income Tax Expense. Our 2008 effective tax rate of 38.4% differed from the 2007 effective tax rate of 32.8% primarily as a result of revisions to the Texas State Franchise Tax Law (Texas margin tax) which was reported as an operating expense prior to 2008 and is now being reported as an income tax for CenterPoint Houston and a Texas state tax examination in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006 Net Income. We reported net income of $399 million ($1.17 per diluted share) for 2007 compared to $432 million ($1.33 per diluted share) for the same period in 2006. The decrease in net income of $33 million was primarily due to a $208 million increase in the loss on our Time Warner investment, a $133 million increase in income tax expense primarily as a result of the favorable tax settlement reached with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2006 related to our 2.0% Zero Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) and Automatic Common Exchange Securities (ACES) and a $33 million increase in interest expense, excluding transition bond-related interest expense, due to higher borrowing levels. These decreases in net income were partially offset by a $191 million increase in the gain on our indexed debt securities, a $140 million increase in operating income and a $10 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. 40 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense. In 2007, our effective tax rate of 32.8% was lower than the expected statutory tax rate as a result of the revised Texas margin tax and a Texas state tax examination for tax years 2002 through 2004. Our 2007 effective tax rate differed from the 2006 effective tax rate of 12.6% primarily due to the favorable tax settlement reached with the IRS in 2006 as discussed above. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2006, 2007 and 2008. Included in revenues are intersegment sales. We account for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.

Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $545 million for 2008, consisting of $407 million from our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU), exclusive of an additional $5 million from the competition transition charge (CTC), and $133 million related to transition bond companies. For 2007, operating income totaled $561 million, consisting of $400 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $42 million from the CTC, and $119 million related to transition bond companies. Revenues for the TDU increased due to customer growth, with over 30,000 metered customers added in 2008 ($23 million), increased usage ($15 million) in part caused by favorable weather experienced in 2008, increased transmission-related revenues ($21 million) and increased revenues from ancillary services ($5 million), partially offset by reduced revenues due to Hurricane Ike ($17 million) and the settlement of the final fuel reconciliation in 2007 ($5 million). Operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher transmission costs ($43 million), the settlement of the final fuel reconciliation in 2007 ($13 million) and increased support services ($13 million), partially offset by a gain on sale of land ($9 million) and normal operating and maintenance expenses that were postponed as a result of Hurricane Ike restoration efforts ($10 million). Depreciation and amortization increased $34 million primarily due to amounts related to the CTC ($30 million), which were offset by similar amounts in revenues. Taxes other than income taxes declined $21 million primarily as a result of the Texas margin tax being classified as an income tax for financial reporting purposes in 2008 ($19 million) and a refund of prior years state franchise taxes ($5 million). 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $561 million for 2007, consisting of $400 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $42 million from the CTC, and $119 million related to transition bond companies. For 2006, operating income totaled $576 million, consisting of $395 million from the TDU, exclusive of an additional $55 million from the CTC, and $126 million related to transition bond companies. Revenues increased due to growth ($22 million), with over 53,000 metered customers added in 2007, higher transmission-related revenues ($22 million), increased miscellaneous service charges ($15 million), increased demand ($7 million), interest on settlement of the final fuel reconciliation ($4 million) and a one-time charge in the second quarter of 2006 related to the resolution of the unbundled cost of service order ($32 million). These increases were partially offset by the rate reduction resulting from the 2006 rate case settlement that was implemented in October 2006 ($41 million) and lower CTC return resulting from the reduction in the allowed interest rate on the unrecovered CTC balance from 11.07% to 8.06% in 2006 ($13 million). Operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher transmission costs ($25 million), the absence of a gain on the sale of property in 2006 ($13 million), and increased expenses, primarily related to low income and energy efficiency programs as required by the 2006 rate case settlement ($8 million), partially offset by settlement of the final fuel reconciliation ($13 million). Natural Gas Distribution The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Revenues $ 3,593 $ 3,759 $ 4,226 Expenses: Natural gas 2,598 2,683 3,124 Operation and maintenance 594 579 589 Depreciation and amortization 152 155 157 Taxes other than income taxes 125 124 141 Total expenses 3,469 3,541 4,011 Operating Income $ 124 $ 218 $ 215 Throughput (in Bcf): Residential 152 172 175 Commercial and industrial 224 232 236 Total Throughput 376 404 411 Number of customers at period end: Residential 2,926,483 2,961,110 2,987,222 Commercial and industrial 246,351 249,877 248,476 Total 3,172,834 3,210,987 3,235,698 42 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $215 million for 2008 compared to $218 million for 2007. Operating income declined due to a combination of non-weather-related usage ($13 million), due in part to higher gas prices, higher customer-related and support services costs ($9 million), higher bad debts and collection costs ($4 million), increased costs of materials and supplies ($4 million), and an increase in depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income taxes ($3 million) resulting from increased investment in property, plant and equipment. The adverse impacts on operating income were partially offset by the net impact of rate increases ($11 million), lower labor and benefits costs ($14 million), and customer growth from the addition of approximately 25,000 customers in 2008 ($6 million). 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $218 million for 2007 compared to $124 million for 2006. Operating income improved as a result of increased usage primarily due to a return to more normal weather in 2007 compared to the unusually mild weather in 2006 ($33 million), growth from the addition of over 38,000 customers in 2007 ($9 million), the effect of the 2006 purchased gas cost write-off ($21 million), the effect of rate changes ($7 million) and reduced operation and maintenance expenses ($15 million). Operation and maintenance expenses declined primarily as a result of costs associated with staff reductions incurred in 2006 ($17 million) and settlement of certain rate case-related items ($9 million), partially offset by increases in bad debts and collection costs ($8 million) and other services ($5 million). Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services The following table provides summary data of our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (in millions, except throughput and customer data): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Revenues $ 3,651 $ 3,579 $ 4,528 Expenses: Natural gas 3,540 3,467 4,423 Operation and maintenance 30 31 39 Depreciation and amortization 1 5 3 Taxes other than income taxes 3 1 1 Total expenses 3,574 3,504 4,466 Operating Income $ 77 $ 75 $ 62 Throughput (in Bcf) 555 522 528 Number of customers at period end 7,024 7,139 9,771 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in operating income of $13 million primarily resulted from lower gains on sales of gas from previously written down inventory ($24 million) and higher operation and maintenance costs ($6 million), which were partially offset by improved margin as basis and summer/winter spreads increased ($12 million). In addition, 2008 included a gain from mark-to-market accounting ($13 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($30 million), compared to a charge to income from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading derivatives ($10 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($11 million) for 2007. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment purchases and stores natural gas to meet certain future sales requirements and enters into derivative contracts to hedge the economic value of the future sales. 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment reported operating income of $75 million for 2007 compared to $77 million for 2006. The decrease in operating income of $2 million was primarily due to reduced opportunities for optimization of pipeline and storage assets resulting from lower locational and seasonal natural gas price differentials in the wholesale business ($10 million) offset by an increase in sales to commercial and industrial customers in the retail business ($3 million). In addition, 2007 included a charge 43 Table of Contents to income from mark-to-market accounting for non-trading derivatives ($10 million) and a write-down of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market ($11 million), compared to a gain from mark-to-market accounting ($37 million) and an inventory write-down ($66 million) for 2006. Interstate Pipelines The following table provides summary data of our Interstate Pipelines business segment for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Revenues $ 388 $ 500 $ 650 Expenses: Natural gas 31 83 155 Operation and maintenance 120 125 133 Depreciation and amortization 37 44 46 Taxes other than income taxes 19 11 23 Total expenses 207 263 357 Operating Income $ 181 $ 237 $ 293 Transportation throughput (in Bcf) 939 1,216 1,538 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $293 million for 2008 compared to $237 million for 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by increased margins (revenues less natural gas costs) on the Carthage to Perryville pipeline that went into service in May 2007 ($51 million), increased transportation and ancillary services ($27 million), and a gain on the sale of two storage development projects ($18 million). These increases are partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses ($19 million), a write-down associated with pipeline assets removed from service ($7 million), increased depreciation expense ($2 million), and higher taxes other than income taxes ($12 million), largely due to tax refunds in 2007. 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Interstate Pipeline business segment reported operating income of $237 million for 2007 compared to $181 million for 2006. The increase in operating income of $56 million was driven primarily by the new Carthage to Perryville pipeline ($42 million), other transportation and ancillary services ($20 million), lower spending in 2007 on project development costs ($6 million) and a decrease in other taxes ($8 million) related to the settlement of certain state tax issues. These favorable variances to operating income were partially offset by lower sales in 2007 of excess gas associated with storage enhancement projects ($15 million) and increased operating expenses ($6 million). Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $6 million and $36 million (including $6 million and $33 million of pre-operating allowance for funds used during construction) in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, from its 50 percent interest in SESH, a jointly-owned pipeline. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption. 44 Table of Contents Field Services The following table provides summary data of our Field Services business segment for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (in millions, except throughput data): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Revenues $ 150 $ 175 $ 252 Expenses: Natural gas (10 ) (4 ) 21 Operation and maintenance 59 66 69 Depreciation and amortization 10 11 12 Taxes other than income taxes 2 3 3 Total expenses 61 76 105 Operating Income $ 89 $ 99 $ 147 Gathering throughput (in Bcf) 375 398 421 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $147 million for 2008 compared to $99 million for 2007. The increase in operating income of $48 million resulted from higher margins (revenue less natural gas costs) from gas gathering, ancillary services and higher commodity prices ($34 million) and a one-time gain related to a settlement and contract buyout of one of our customers ($11 million). Operating expenses increased from 2007 to 2008 due to higher expenses associated with new assets and general cost increases, partially offset by a gain related to the sale of assets in 2008 ($7 million). 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Field Services business segment reported operating income of $99 million for 2007 compared to $89 million for 2006. Continued increased demand for gas gathering and ancillary services ($27 million) was partially offset by lower commodity prices ($10 million) and increased operation and maintenance expenses related to cost increases and expanded operations ($7 million). Equity Earnings. In addition, this business segment recorded equity income of $6 million, $10 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, from its 50 percent interest in a jointly-owned gas processing plant. These amounts are included in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates under the Other Income (Expense) caption. Other Operations The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2006, 2007 and 2008 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Revenues $ 15 $ 10 $ 11 Expenses 17 15 Operating Income (Loss) $ (2 ) $ (5 ) $ 11 2008 Compared to 2007. Our Other Operations business segment operating income in 2008 compared to 2007 increased by $16 million primarily as a result of a decrease in franchise taxes ($7 million) and a decrease in benefits accruals ($4 million). 2007 Compared to 2006. Our Other Operations business segment operating loss in 2007 compared to 2006 increased by $3 million. 45 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Cash Flow The net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for 2006, 2007 and 2008 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 991 $ 774 $ 851 Investing activities (1,056 ) (1,300 ) (1,368 ) Financing activities 118 528 555 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased $77 million compared to 2007 primarily due to decreased tax payments/increased tax refunds ($289 million), increased net accounts receivable/payable ($190 million), increased fuel cost recovery ($138 million) and increased pre-tax income ($131 million). These increases were partially offset by increased net regulatory assets and liabilities ($447 million) and increased net margin deposits ($247 million). Net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 decreased $217 million compared to 2006 primarily due to the timing of fuel recovery ($204 million), increased tax payments ($10 million), increased interest payments ($40 million), increased gas storage inventory ($36 million) and decreased net accounts receivable/payable ($178 million). These decreases were partially offset by decreased reductions in customer margin deposit requirements ($76 million) and decreases in our margin deposit requirements ($145 million). Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $68 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increased investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $167 million, primarily related to the SESH pipeline project, which was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures of $94 million. Net cash used in investing activities increased $244 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased capital expenditures of $107 million primarily related to pipeline projects for our Interstate Pipelines business segment, increased notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates of $148 million and increased investment in unconsolidated affiliates of $26 million, primarily related to the SESH pipeline project. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 increased $27 million compared to 2007 primarily due to increased borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($779 million) and increased proceeds from long-term debt ($188 million), which were partially offset by increased repayments of long-term debt ($825 million) and decreased short-term borrowings ($124 million). Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 increased $410 million compared to 2006 primarily due to increased borrowings under revolving credit facilities ($334 million) and increased proceeds from long-term debt ($576 million), which were partially offset by increased repayments of long-term debt ($319 million), increased dividend payments ($31 million) and decreased short-term borrowings ($142 million). Future Sources and Uses of Cash Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal anticipated cash requirements for 2009 include the following: 46 Table of Contents approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditures; maturing long-term debt aggregating approximately $216 million, including $208 million of transition bonds; and dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and interest payments on debt. We expect that borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in 2009. Cash needs or discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2008 and estimates of our capital requirements for 2009 through 2013 (in millions): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Electric Transmission & Distribution $ 481 $ 422 $ 591 $ 579 $ 504 $ 506 Natural Gas Distribution 214 155 234 241 243 249 Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services 8 3 3 3 3 3 Interstate Pipelines 189 202 151 87 67 70 Field Services 122 277 142 82 93 85 Other Operations 39 39 38 39 31 27 Total $ 1,053 $ 1,098 $ 1,159 $ 1,031 $ 941 $ 940 The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations, including payments due by period (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 2014 and thereafter Transition bond debt $ 2,589 $ 208 $ 461 $ 546 $ 1,374 Other long-term debt(1) 8,624 8 792 2,732 5,092 Interest payments transition bond debt(2) 794 140 227 177 250 Interest payments other long-term debt(2) 4,812 481 948 794 2,589 Short-term borrowings 153 153 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases(3) 75 14 23 13 25 Benefit obligations(4) Purchase obligations(5) 24 24 Non-trading derivative liabilities 134 87 41 6 Other commodity commitments(6) 3,520 776 911 877 956 Income taxes(7) 121 121 Other 30 5 13 12 Total contractual cash obligations $ 20,877 $ 2,017 $ 3,416 $ 5,157 $ 10,287 __________ (1) ZENS obligations are included in 2029 at their contingent principal amount of $817 million. These obligations are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders for 95% of the current value of the Time Warner reference shares ($218 million at December 31, 2008), as discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. (2) We calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt as follows: for fixed-rate debt and term debt, we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates; for variable-rate debt and/or non-term debt, we used interest rates in place as of December 31, 2008. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 10(b) to our consolidated financial statements. 47 Table of Contents (4) Material contributions to our qualified pension plan are not expected in 2009. However, we expect to contribute approximately $9 million and $18 million, respectively, to our non-qualified pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2009. (5) Represents capital commitments for material in connection with the construction of a pipeline by our Interstate Pipelines business segment. This project has been included in the table of capital expenditures presented above. (6) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 10(a) to our consolidated financial statements. (7) Represents estimated income tax liability for settled positions for tax years under examination. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $117 million. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than operating leases and the guaranties described below, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI trading subsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure CERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for CERC benefit, and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. In December 2007, we, CERC and RRI amended that agreement and CERC released the letters of credit it held as security. Under the revised agreement RRI agreed to provide cash or new letters of credit to secure CERC against exposure under the remaining guaranties as calculated under the new agreement if and to the extent changes in market conditions exposed CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties. The potential exposure to CERC under the guaranties relates to payment of demand charges related to transportation contracts. The present value of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be effective until 2018, was approximately $108 million as of December 31, 2008. RRI continues to meet its obligations under the contracts, and on the basis of market conditions, we and CERC have not required additional security. However, if RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the contracts or if RRI should fail to provide adequate security in the event market conditions change adversely, we would retain our exposure to the counterparty under the guaranty. Debt Financing Transactions. Pursuant to a financing order issued by the Texas Utility Commission in September 2007, in February 2008 a subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston issued approximately $488 million in transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of 4.192% and 5.234% and final maturity dates in February 2020 and February 2023, respectively. Scheduled final payment dates are February 2017 and February 2020. Through issuance of the transition bonds, CenterPoint Houston securitized transition property of approximately $483 million representing the remaining balance of the CTC, adjusted to refund certain unspent environmental retrofit costs and to recover the amount of the fuel reconciliation settlement. In April 2008, we purchased $175 million principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at 102% of their principal amount. Prior to the purchase, $100 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 7.75% and $75 million principal amount of such bonds had a fixed rate of interest of 8%. Depending on market conditions, we may remarket both series of bonds, at 100% of their principal amounts, in 2009. In April 2008, we called our 3.75% convertible senior notes for redemption on May 30, 2008. At the time of the announcement, the notes were convertible at the option of the holders, and substantially all of the notes were submitted for conversion on or prior to the May 30, 2008 redemption date. During the year ended December 31, 48 Table of Contents 2008, we issued 16.9 million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately $532 million to settle conversions of approximately $535 million principal amount of our 3.75% convertible senior notes. In May 2008, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.50%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the satisfaction of cash payment obligations in connection with conversions of our 3.75% convertible senior notes as discussed above. In May 2008, CERC Corp. issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in May 2018 with an interest rate of 6.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and loans to or investments in affiliates. In December 2008, CERC entered into an asset management agreement whereby it sold $110 million of its natural gas in storage and agreed to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas during the 2008-2009 winter heating season for payments totaling $114 million. This transaction was accounted for as a financing and, as of December 31, 2008, the consolidated financial statements reflect natural gas inventory of $75 million and a financing obligation of $75 million related to this transaction. In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 million principal amount of general mortgage bonds, due in March 2014 with an interest rate of 7.00%. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and from the money pool, capital expenditures and storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Ike. Equity Financing Transactions. In 2008, we received proceeds of approximately $65 million from the sale of approximately 4.9 million common shares to our defined contribution plan and proceeds of approximately $13 million from the sale of approximately 0.9 million common shares to participants in our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan. Credit and Receivables Facilities. In November 2008, CenterPoint Houston entered into a $600 million 364-day credit facility. The credit facility will terminate if bonds are issued to securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike and if those bonds are issued prior to the November 24, 2009 expiration of the facility. CenterPoint Houston expects to seek legislative and regulatory approval for the issuance of such bonds during 2009. The 364-day credit facility is secured by a pledge of $600 million of general mortgage bonds issued by CenterPoint Houston. Borrowing costs for London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loans will be at a margin of 2.25 percent above LIBOR rates, based on CenterPoint Houston current ratings. In addition, CenterPoint Houston will pay lenders, based on current ratings, a per annum commitment fee of 0.5 percent for their commitments under the facility and a quarterly duration fee of 0.75 percent on the average amount of outstanding borrowings during the quarter. The spread to LIBOR and the commitment fee fluctuate based on the borrower credit rating. The facility contains covenants, including a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant. Our $1.2 billion credit facility has a first drawn cost of LIBOR plus 55 basis points based on our current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition bonds) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant, which was modified (i) in August 2008 so that the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would continue at its then-current level for the remaining term of the facility and (ii) in November 2008 so that the permitted ratio of debt to EBITDA would be temporarily increased until the earlier of December 31, 2009 or CenterPoint Houston issuance of bonds to securitize the costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike, after which time the permitted ratio would revert to the level that existed prior to the November 2008 modification. CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt (excluding transition and other securitization bonds) to total capitalization covenant. CERC Corp. $950 million credit facility first drawn cost is LIBOR plus 45 basis points based on CERC Corp. current credit ratings. The facility contains a debt to total capitalization covenant. 49 Table of Contents Under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp $950 million credit facility, an additional utilization fee of 5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. The spread to LIBOR and the utilization fee fluctuate based on the borrower credit rating. Borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC Corp. consider customary. In November 2008, CERC replaced a receivables facility that had expired in October 2008 with a new receivables facility that expires in November 2009. Availability under the new facility ranges from $128 million to $375 million, reflecting seasonal changes in receivables balances. We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC Corp. are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants contained in the respective credit facilities as disclosed above. As of February 13, 2009, we had the following facilities (in millions): Date Executed Company Type of Facility Size of Facility Amount Utilized at February 13, 2009 Termination Date June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Energy Revolver $ 1,156 $ 184 (2) June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CenterPoint Houston Revolver 289 4 June 29, 2012 June 29, 2007 CERC Corp.

(2) Includes $155 million of borrowings and $29 million of outstanding letters of credit. (3) Includes $4 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our $1.2 billion credit facility backstops a $1.0 billion CenterPoint Energy commercial paper program under which we began issuing commercial paper in June 2005. The $950 million CERC Corp. credit facility backstops a $915 million commercial paper program under which CERC Corp. began issuing commercial paper in February 2008. The CenterPoint Energy commercial paper is rated Not Prime by Moody Investors Service, Inc. (Moody s), A-2 by Standard & Poor Rating Services (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, and F3 by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch). The CERC Corp. commercial paper is rated P-3 by Moody s, A-2 by S&P, and F2 by Fitch. As a result of the credit ratings on the two commercial paper programs, we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short-term borrowing requirements. We cannot assure you that these ratings, or the credit ratings set forth below in Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings, will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. Securities Registered with the SEC. In October 2008, CenterPoint Energy and CenterPoint Houston jointly registered indeterminate principal amounts of CenterPoint Houston general mortgage bonds and CenterPoint Energy senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of CenterPoint 50 Table of Contents Energy shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. In addition, CERC Corp. has a shelf registration statement covering $500 million principal amount of senior debt securities. Temporary Investments. As of February 13, 2009, we had no external temporary investments. Money Pool. We have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. As of February 13, 2009, Moody s, S&P, and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: Moody S&P Fitch Company/Instrument Rating Outlook(1) Rating Outlook(2) Rating Outlook(3) CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Ba1 Stable BBB- Stable BBB- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt (First Mortgage Bonds) Baa2 Stable BBB+ Stable A- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt (General Mortgage Bonds) Baa2 Stable BBB+ Stable BBB+ Stable CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt Baa3 Stable BBB Stable BBB Stable __________ (1) A stable outlook from Moody indicates that Moody does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within 18 months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A stable outlook from Fitch encompasses a one- to two-year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. A decline in these credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our $1.2 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston $289 million credit facility and CERC Corp. $950 million credit facility. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments. In September 1999, we issued ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $840 million remain outstanding. Each ZENS note is exchangeable at the holder option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. common stock (TW Common) attributable to each ZENS note. If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS note holders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax liabilities related to the ZENS notes and TW Common shares become current tax obligations when ZENS notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and TW Common shares are sold. A tax obligation of approximately $378 million would have been payable with respect to the ZENS for the 2008 tax year if all of the ZENS had been exchanged for cash on December 31, 2008. The ultimate tax obligation related to the ZENS notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the ZENS notes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, enacted on February 17, 2009, allows us to elect to defer this tax obligation until 2014 and to recognize it over the period from 2014 through 2018 for any ZENS retired in 2009 or 2010. CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp. operating in our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segment, provides comprehensive natural gas sales and 51 Table of Contents services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern United States. In order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES. As of December 31, 2008, the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately $229 million. Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral on two business days notice up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. We estimate that as of December 31, 2008, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregate $250 million; however, utilized credit capacity is significantly lower. In addition, CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of $100 million based on CERC Corp. S&P Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt rating of BBB. Upgrades and downgrades from this BBB rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly. Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC Corp. might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $160 million, the amount depending on seasonal variations in transportation levels. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. In addition, four outstanding series of our senior notes, aggregating $950 million in principal amount as of February 13, 2009, provide that a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, will cause a default. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures . From time to time, we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. We may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to us at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including gas purchases, gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business segments, particularly given gas price levels and volatility; acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers; increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas; increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities; various regulatory actions; 52 Table of Contents the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of CenterPoint Houston and in respect of RRI indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which CERC is a guarantor; slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions; the outcome of litigation brought by and against us; contributions to benefit plans; restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report. Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money. CenterPoint Houston credit facilities limit CenterPoint Houston debt (excluding transition bonds) as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. CERC Corp. bank facility and its receivables facility limit CERC debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 65%. Our $1.2 billion credit facility contains a debt, excluding transition bonds, to EBITDA covenant. Such covenant was modified twice in 2008 to provide additional debt capacity. The second modification was to provide debt capacity for the financing of system restoration costs following Hurricane Ike. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. Accounting for Rate Regulation Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and portions of our Interstate Pipelines business segment apply SFAS No. 71. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is 53 Table of Contents probable, as defined in SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5), that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2008, we had recorded regulatory assets of $3.7 billion and regulatory liabilities of $821 million. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. No impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis as of July 1, 2008. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, interest rates, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. Asset Retirement Obligations We account for our long-lived assets under SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations An Interpretation of SFAS No. 143 (FIN 47). SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In the same period, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Rate-regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, and costs recovered through the ratemaking process. We estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components: Inflation adjustment The estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor, equipment, materials, and other disposal costs; Discount rate The estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium; and Third-party markup adjustments Internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset. Changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47. For example, if the inflation adjustment increased 25 basis points, this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 3.0%. Similarly, an increase in the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage. At December 31, 2008, our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately $63 million. Unbilled Energy Revenues Revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their 54 Table of Contents meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. Pension and Other Retirement Plans We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read Other Significant Matters Pension Plans for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(o) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans. As discussed in Note 2(p) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA. We made no contribution to the qualified pension plans in 2007 and 2008. The minimum funding requirements for these plans did not require contributions for the respective years. Additionally, we maintain an unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. Employer contributions for the non-qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled $9 million and $8 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires us, as the sponsor of a plan, to (a) recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan over-funded status or as a liability such plan under-funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and obligations as of the 55 Table of Contents end of our fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006, we recorded a regulatory asset of $466 million and a charge to accumulated comprehensive income of $79 million, net of tax. At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by $434 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2009 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions. Pension expense was $46 million, $15 million and $1 million for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2008, our qualified pension plan had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%, which was 0.50% lower than the rate assumed as of December 31, 2007. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 6.90%, which is a 0.50% increase from the 6.40% discount rate assumed in 2007. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension expense for 2009, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $112 million, of which we expect $89 million to impact pre-tax earnings, based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.0% and a discount rate of 6.90% as of December 31, 2008. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.5% (from 8.00% to 7.50%), 2009 pension expense would increase by approximately $6 million. As of December 31, 2008, the pension plan projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets (including the unfunded benefit restoration plan) by $434 million. If the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 6.90% to 6.40%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2009 pension expense by approximately $74 million and $5 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would impact our Consolidated Balance Sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2008 by $59 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2008 of $10 million, net of tax. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be.
