We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors . We have based our forward looking statements on our management beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share ( EPS ), liquidity and capital resources and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A ) is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of Amgen Inc., including its subsidiaries (referred to as Amgen, the Company, we, our and us ). MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp , EPOGEN , Neulasta /NEUPOGEN and ENBREL all of which are sold in the United States. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada. Our international product sales consist principally of European sales of Aranesp and Neulasta /NEUPOGEN . For additional information about our principal products, their approved indications and where they are marketed, see Item 1. Business Principal Products . We operate in a highly regulated industry and various U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial authority over how we conduct our business in those countries. Government authorities in the United States and in other countries regulate the manufacturing and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. For example, prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a product, we must conduct extensive clinical studies designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for use in humans in the indications sought. Furthermore, in order to maintain regulatory approval to market a product, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials and to provide additional information on safety and effectiveness. The regulatory environment is evolving and there is increased scrutiny on drug safety and increased authority being granted to regulatory bodies, in particular the FDA, to assist in ensuring the safety of therapeutic products. For example, on September 27, 2007, President Bush signed into law the FDAAA, significantly adding to the FDA authority (see Item 1. Business Government Regulation ). 67 Table of Contents Most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by either government and/or private payer health care programs. The reimbursement environment is evolving with greater emphasis on cost containment. For example, failure to demonstrate a clear economic value associated with the use of a new therapeutic product as compared to existing therapeutic products or practices may result in reduced reimbursement. Therefore, sales of our products are and will continue to be affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans and administration of those programs. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers or patients in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce or reallocate healthcare expenditures. Further, safety signals or adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators) or from the marketed use of our drugs may expand safety labeling or restrict the use for our approved products and may negatively impact worldwide reimbursement for our products. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see Item 1. Business Reimbursement . For the year ended December 31, 2007, total revenues were $14.8 billion and net income was $3.2 billion, or $2.82 per share on a diluted basis. In addition to the factors noted in Item 1. Business Key Developments , our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were negatively impacted by the write-off of $590 million of acquired IPR&D related to the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa and charges of $739 million in connection with our previously announced restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.2 billion, of which approximately $6.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. Our total debt outstanding was $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. Our product sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $14.3 billion representing an increase of $453 million, or 3%, over product sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase reflects growth primarily in ENBREL and Neulasta /NEUPOGEN significantly offset by a decline in Aranesp . The decline in sales of Aranesp , in particular Aranesp sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care segment, reflects a decrease in demand resulting from various regulatory and reimbursement developments in 2007, as discussed below. International product sales in 2007 represented 20% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales of Aranesp , Neulasta and NEUPOGEN . International product sales grew 17% in 2007 to $2.9 billion, principally driven by sales of Neulasta /NEUPOGEN and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. International product sales growth during 2007 was favorably impacted by $193 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. Both the positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign currency exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated, in part, by the natural, opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. As discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business Key Developments, certain of our products, principally our marketed ESA products, face various challenges primarily arising from regulatory and reimbursement developments that began in 2007. The developments impacting our marketed ESA products include revisions to product labels to reflect adverse safety results in various clinical studies involving ESA products performed by us and others and the loss of or significant restrictions on reimbursements. Furthermore, our ESA products continue to face future challenges, including the potential for further revisions to product labels and changes to reimbursement. These developments have had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of our ESA marketed products, in particular Aranesp sales in the U.S. supportive cancer care segment. In addition, increased competition, including additional approved indications for existing products, has and will continue to present challenges to certain of our products. 68 Table of Contents As a result of the above developments, in particular the regulatory and reimbursement changes that began in 2007 involving ESA products, and their resulting impact on our operations, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. In connection with the implementation of our restructuring plan, we currently estimate that we will incur $775 million to $825 million of restructuring charges. Included in such amounts are (i) severance related costs of $185 million to $200 million with respect to staff reductions, aggregating approximately 2,200 to 2,600 positions or approximately 12% to 14% of our worldwide staff; (ii) asset related charges of $450 million to $470 million primarily consisting of asset impairments and accelerated depreciation resulting from rationalizing our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities in order to gain cost efficiencies while continuing to meet future commercial and clinical demand for our products and product candidates and, to a lesser degree, changes to certain R&D capital projects and (iii) other costs of $140 million to $155 million, principally related to the accrual of losses for leases for certain R&D facilities that will not be used in our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed the majority of the above-noted actions and incurred $739 million of restructuring costs. We expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions, discussed above, will be completed and the related estimated costs incurred in 2008. In connection with our efforts to improve our cost structure, we refocused our spending on critical R&D and operational priorities and sought greater efficiencies in how we conduct our business, including optimizing ongoing clinical trials and trial initiation. These efforts will assist in allowing us to provide continued support of key activities including (i) current and future postmarketing studies, including those with respect to our ESA products, Aranesp and EPOGEN ; (ii) regulatory affairs, safety and compliance functions; (iii) clinical studies to advance our late-stage pipeline; (iv) the advancement of earlier stage compounds and (v) research efforts in the core areas of oncology, inflammation, bone and metabolic disorders. In order to continue advancing our expanding pipeline of product candidates and to assist in ensuring that patients around the world are able to benefit from our future products, we are also seeking partners to assist in the development of selected product candidates in our pipeline in certain countries and/or worldwide. For example, in July 2007 we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize denosumab in Japan in PMO and oncology with the potential for additional indications. In February 2008, we entered into a license agreement with Takeda, which provided them the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize for the Japanese market up to 13 early to mid-stage molecules from our pipeline across a range of therapeutic areas, including oncology and inflammation. The molecules covered by the license agreement primarily include: AMG 108, AMG 317, AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and Vectibix (panitumumab). Amgen has the right to participate in the promotion of these products in Japan. In addition, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda for the worldwide development and commercialization of motesanib diphosphate (AMG 706). Each party has the right to participate in the commercialization of motesanib diphosphate in the other party territory. In connection with these agreements, Takeda has agreed to acquire our subsidiary in Japan, Amgen K.K. On July 16, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Alantos, which was accounted for as a business combination. Alantos was a privately held company that specialized in the development of drugs for the treatment of diabetes and inflammatory diseases. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid cash of approximately $300 million to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alantos. The transaction provides Amgen with Alantos lead drug candidate, a DPP-IV inhibitor in clinical development (phase 2a) for the treatment of type II diabetes. On July 18, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Ilypsa, which was accounted for as a business combination. Ilypsa was a privately held company that specialized in the development of non-absorbed drugs for renal disorders. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid cash of approximately $400 million to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ilypsa. The transaction provides Amgen with Ilypsa lead drug candidate, a phosphate binder in clinical development (phase 2) for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. 69 Table of Contents There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business generally and uniquely, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D due, in part, to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies and/or safety-related label changes for approved products; increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates; reimbursement changes; healthcare provider prescribing behavior, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; complex and expanding regulatory requirements; and intellectual property protection. (See Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Aranesp $ 3,614 (12 )% $ 4,121 26 % $ 3,273 EPOGEN 2,489 (1 )% 2,511 2 % 2,455 Neulasta /NEUPOGEN 4,277 9 % 3,923 12 % 3,504 ENBREL 3,230 12 % 2,879 12 % 2,573 Sensipar 463 44 % 321 104 % 157 Vectibix 170 336 % 39 n/a Other 68 6 % 64 7 % 60 Total product sales $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 15 % $ 12,022 Total U.S. $ 11,443 0 % $ 11,397 15 % $ 9,892 Total International 2,868 17 % 2,461 16 % 2,130 Total product sales $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 15 % $ 12,022 Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, government programs, regulatory developments or guidelines, clinical trial outcomes, clinical practice, pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, patient population, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply and acquisitions. (See Item 1. Business Principal Products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Sales growth in 2007 was principally driven by ENBREL and Neulasta sales, which was substantially offset by a decline in Aranesp sales. In particular for the year ended December 31, 2007, U.S. Aranesp sales declined 23%, primarily reflecting a decrease in demand resulting from recent regulatory and reimbursement developments as discussed in more detail below. Sales growth in 2006 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp , Neulasta and ENBREL, which benefited from share gains and/or market growth. International product sales growth in 2007 was favorably impacted by $193 million and unfavorably impacted by $13 million in 2006 from foreign currency exchange rate changes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international product sales increased 9% and 16% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. 70 Table of Contents Aranesp For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Aranesp U.S. $ 2,154 (23 )% $ 2,790 33 % $ 2,104 Aranesp International 1,460 10 % 1,331 14 % 1,169 Total Aranesp $ 3,614 (12 )% $ 4,121 26 % $ 3,273 The decrease in U.S. Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was principally driven by a decline in demand. This decline primarily reflects physician conformance to label and reimbursement changes that occurred throughout 2007, primarily in the supportive cancer care setting and, to a lesser extent, a decline in our segment share. Given the timing of these label and reimbursement changes, their impact was primarily realized in the second half of 2007, with U.S. Aranesp sales experiencing a decrease of 38% compared to the second half of 2006. During the latter part of the three months ended December 31, 2007, Aranesp sales began to stabilize within a reasonable range as physicians incorporated into their anemia management approaches the new labels and reimbursement changes. In particular, these developments, which are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business Key Developments, include the Decision Memorandum issued by CMS on July 30, 2007, which significantly restricts Medicare reimbursement for use of Aranesp in CIA and which we believe has also negatively impacted Aranesp use in CIA for patients covered by private insurance plans. In addition, these developments include a significant decline in Aranesp use in AoC throughout 2007 and the ESA product label changes in the United States, which occurred on March 9, 2007 and November 8, 2007. The increase in international Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of $100 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, international Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 2%. International sales were negatively impacted in Europe by dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and pricing pressures across all ESAs. Through December 31, 2007, biosimilars and other recently introduced marketed products in Europe have not had a significant impact on Aranesp sales. The increase in U.S. Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily driven by demand reflecting segment growth and share gains. The growth in U.S. Aranesp sales also reflects increased Aranesp usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics from continued conversion from EPOGEN , which we believe stabilized in mid-2006. The increase in international Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was also principally driven by demand. In addition to the factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future worldwide Aranesp sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement developments including: CMS Decision Memorandum issued on July 30, 2007 which significantly restricts Medicare reimbursement for the use of Aranesp in CIA and any related impact on private payers reimbursement or healthcare providers prescribing behavior; reimbursement changes resulting from current or future product label changes; reimbursement and cost containment pressures by third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans; regulatory developments, including: product label changes occurring on November 8, 2007 and March 9, 2007 in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp and EPOGEN ; pending product label changes in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp and EPOGEN , as a result of discussions with the FDA regarding safety data from the PREPARE and GOG-191 studies and the submission of a PAS in December 2007 that addressed questions raised at the May 10, 2007 ODAC meeting; 71 Table of Contents potential for additional label changes for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp , resulting from the ODAC meeting on March 13, 2008; pending changes to product information from the EMEA for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp , in Europe; our ability to maintain a competitive segment share and differentiate Aranesp from current and potential future competition; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), such as those referred to in Item 1. Business Key Developments , which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; an increasingly competitive environment of products or therapies, including biosimilar products which have launched in certain countries outside of the United States, for example Roche peg-EPO product, MIRCERA and Shire erythropoietin product Dynepo (Epoetin delta), and biosimilar products that have been or are expected to be launched in the future; and development of new treatments for cancer and future chemotherapy treatments. For example, those that are less myelosuppressive may require less Aranesp ; any or all of which could have a material adverse impact on future sales of Aranesp . See Item 1. Business Key Developments and Item 1A. Risk Factors herein for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. EPOGEN For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total EPOGEN sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 EPOGEN U.S. $ 2,489 (1 )% $ 2,511 2 % $ 2,455 The decline in EPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects a decrease in demand due to a decline in dose/utilization, partially offset by patient population growth of 3%. The decline in dose/utilization is due to physician behavior in making treatment and dosing decisions in response to regulatory and reimbursement developments, that occurred throughout 2007. As discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business Key Developments, these developments include the issuance by the NKF of the final KDOQI guidelines, the March 9, 2007 and November 8, 2007 ESA product label changes and the anticipation of CMS announced revisions to its EMP, effective January 1, 2008. The decline in sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was partially offset by favorable changes in wholesaler inventory and spillover (see Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Product sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Reported EPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased modestly primarily due to the increased demand in the free-standing dialysis centers partially offset by the increased use of Aranesp in the hospital setting. We believe that conversion to Aranesp in the hospital setting stabilized in mid-2006. We believe demand for EPOGEN in the free-standing dialysis centers, which account for the majority of the EPOGEN sales, remained consistent with patient population growth. In addition to the factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future EPOGEN sales will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: reimbursement developments including: reimbursement changes resulting from CMS announced revisions to its EMP, effective January 1, 2008; 72 Table of Contents reimbursement changes resulting from current or future product label changes; changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government; regulatory developments, including: product label changes occurring on November 8, 2007 and March 9, 2007 in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp and EPOGEN ; pending product label changes in the United States for the class of ESAs, including Aranesp and EPOGEN , as a result of discussions with the FDA regarding safety data from the PREPARE and GOG-191 studies and the submission of a PAS in December 2007 that addressed questions raised at the May 10, 2007 ODAC meeting; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, including: changes in medical guidelines resulting from the NKF issuance of the final KDOQI guidelines; legislative actions; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us, including our pharmacovigilance clinical trials, or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), such as those referred to in Item 1. Business Key Developments , which have and could further impact product safety labeling, negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; cost containment pressures from the federal government on healthcare providers; and pricing strategies; any or all of which could have a material adverse impact on future sales of EPOGEN . See Item 1. Business Key Developments and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Neulasta U.S. $ 2,351 6 % $ 2,217 17 % $ 1,900 NEUPOGEN U.S. 861 4 % 830 3 % 805 U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total 3,212 5 % 3,047 13 % 2,705 Neulasta International 649 32 % 493 27 % 388 NEUPOGEN International 416 9 % 383 (7 )% 411 International Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total 1,065 22 % 876 10 % 799 Total Worldwide Neulasta /NEUPOGEN $ 4,277 9 % $ 3,923 12 % $ 3,504 The increase in U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by demand for Neulasta primarily due to segment growth and, to a lesser degree, favorable changes to wholesaler inventory levels. The increase in international Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by the continued conversion to Neulasta from NEUPOGEN and changes in foreign exchange, which positively impacted the year ended December 31, 2007 combined sales by $74 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, combined international Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales increased 13%. 73 Table of Contents The increase in U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta , reflecting segment growth. In addition, the increase in demand for Neulasta for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a price increase in April 2006. U.S. demand for Neulasta continued to benefit from a product label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle utilization in moderate-high risk chemotherapy regimens. The increase in international Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta . In addition to the factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future worldwide Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: penetration of existing segments; competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products that may be approved in the EU sometime in 2008 and be available shortly thereafter; reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and private insurance plans; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; our ability to minimize distraction due to ESA issues; pricing strategies; patient growth; and development of new treatments for cancer and future chemotherapy treatments. For example, those that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta /NEUPOGEN , however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta /NEUPOGEN . See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 ENBREL U.S. $ 3,052 12 % $ 2,736 11 % $ 2,470 ENBREL International 178 24 % 143 39 % 103 Total ENBREL $ 3,230 12 % $ 2,879 12 % $ 2,573 ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2007 was driven by demand due to increases in both patients and net sales price. While ENBREL continued to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, the sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2007 was affected by slight share declines in the United States in both segments versus the prior year due to increased competitive activity. ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven by increased demand in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. The increase in demand for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a U.S. price increase. While ENBREL continued to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, we have experienced moderate share loss in both segments in 2006 compared to 2005. ENBREL sales growth was also affected in 2006 by slowing segment growth in dermatology and by increased competitive activities in both segments. 74 Table of Contents In addition to the factors mentioned in the Product sales section above, future worldwide ENBREL sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as: the effects of competing products or therapies, which may include new indications for existing products such as a treatment for adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for HUMIRA , and new competitive products coming to market, such as J&J CNTO 1275 (ustekinumab) and CNTO 148 (golimumab) and, in part, our ability to differentiate ENBREL based on its safety profile and efficacy; pending change to the patient safety information in the form of a boxed warning that will apply to the ENBREL label as has been the case with other TNF inhibitor agents; growth in the rheumatology and dermatology segments; impact of converting from primarily drop-shipping orders directly to pharmacies to a wholesaler distribution model primarily occurring in the three months ending March 31, 2008; the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payers; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others (including our licensees or independent investigators), which could expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; pricing strategies; and penetration of existing and new segments, including potential new indications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain of the above factors that could impact our future product sales. Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes our product sales and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 Change 2006 Change 2005 Product sales $ 14,311 3 % $ 13,858 15 % $ 12,022 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,548 22 % $ 2,095 1 % $ 2,082 % of product sales 18 % 15 % 17 % Research and development $ 3,266 (3 )% $ 3,366 45 % $ 2,314 % of product sales 23 % 24 % 19 % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,361 0 % $ 3,366 21 % $ 2,790 % of product sales 23 % 24 % 23 % Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 298 $ 370 $ 347 Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ 590 $ 1,231 $ Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) $ 728 $ $ 49 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see Consolidated Statements of Income ), increased 22% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily driven by restructuring and related charges, discussed below, product mix due to higher sales of ENBREL, excess capacity 75 Table of Contents charges at our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico and the write-off of excess inventory related to certain new product presentations. The Company expects excess capacity charges to continue to occur through 2008 due principally to declining product sales and related demand for Aranesp resulting from regulatory and reimbursement developments. Included in costs of sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 are restructuring charges of $150 million, primarily related to accelerated depreciation resulting from the decision to accelerate the closure of one of our ENBREL commercial bulk manufacturing operations in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities. See Note 2, Restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In addition, cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a $90 million write-off of excess inventory related to changing regulatory and reimbursement environments. Cost of sales increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to lower royalties and a more favorable product mix and cost efficiencies at our factories. Royalty expenses were lower due to the expiration of certain contractual royalty obligations on Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales and the acquisition of certain royalty rights on sales of ENBREL and EU Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales. Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of costs and expenses for salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy, clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing, including contract services and other outside costs, process development, quality assurance, information systems and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include such costs related to activities performed on behalf of corporate partners and cost recoveries from collaboration partners. R&D expenses decreased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was primarily attributable to reductions in in-licensing expenses of approximately $95 million primarily due to our agreement with Cytokinetics entered into in 2006 and a $50 million benefit in 2007 from third-party collaborations primarily with respect to out-licensing denosumab in Japan to Daiichi Sankyo. These decreases in R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were partially offset by $19 million of restructuring costs, comprised of $38 million in charges related to asset impairments offset by a $19 million benefit associated with the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which were forfeited as a result of the employees termination. See Note 2, Restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In 2006, R&D expenses increased 45% over the prior year, primarily due to higher staff levels and increased funding necessary to support clinical trials for our late-stage programs, which included denosumab, our late-stage investigational product for PMO and bone metastasis, and the continued expansion of our research and pre-clinical organization to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic. In addition, R&D for the year ended December 31, 2006, includes approximately $48 million in non-cash amortization expense for the intangible asset, XenoMouse technology, acquired in the Abgenix acquisition. In 2006, staff-related costs, including stock option compensation, and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $467 million and $355 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses including Wyeth profit share; overhead and occupancy costs; other legal costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A remained relatively unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, outside legal costs increased $53 million and outside marketing costs increased approximately $59 million. The increase in outside marketing is primarily due to an increase in Wyeth profit share, partially offset by reductions in promotion and advertising on marketed products. These increases were offset by approximately $124 million in expense recoveries associated with our restructuring. See Note 2, Restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 76 Table of Contents Pursuant to our co-promotion agreement, we share profits on sales of ENBREL in the United States and Canada with Wyeth (see Item 1. Business Joint Ventures and Business Relationships ). For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Wyeth profit share expenses, excluding recoveries associated with our restructuring, were approximately 30% and 25%, respectively, of total SG&A. SG&A increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher staff levels and additional infrastructure costs to support the growing organization, in particular our Global Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system, higher Wyeth profit share expenses related to ENBREL sales and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation. SG&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 included approximately $120 million in stock option expense, which was not reflected in our results of operations prior to January 1, 2006. Staff-related costs, including stock option compensation and additional infrastructure costs increased over 2005 by $323 million and $59 million, respectively. In addition, outside marketing expenses and legal costs increased by $198 million and $38 million, respectively. The increase in outside marketing expenses was in support of our principal products, including the Wyeth profit share related to increased ENBREL sales growth in 2006 as compared to 2005. Amortization of acquired intangible assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. In 2007 and 2006, this amortization also included $3 million and $49 million, respectively, related to the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Write-off of acquired in-process research and development The fair value of acquired IPR&D projects, which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition, are immediately expensed. In 2007, we wrote-off a total of $590 million of acquired IPR&D. This amount is comprised of $270 million in connection with the Alantos acquisition related to an orally administered treatment for type II diabetes that at the date of acquisition was in phase 2a clinical trials and $320 million in connection with the Ilypsa acquisition related to a phosphate binder that at the date of acquisition was in phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis. In 2006, we wrote-off $1.1 billion of acquired IPR&D related to the Abgenix acquisition and $130 million of acquired IPR&D in connection with the Avidia acquisition. The Abgenix IPR&D amount is primarily comprised of approximately $770 million related to the rights which we did not own pursuant to our agreement with Abgenix to jointly develop and commercialize panitumumab and approximately $330 million related to a royalty that we would have owed to Abgenix with respect to future sales of denosumab as a result of using certain of Abgenix patented technology in the development of this product candidate. Panitumumab was Abgenix fully human monoclonal antibody which, at acquisition, was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of cancer. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is a key mediator of the resorptive phase of bone remodeling and was in phase 2/3 clinical trials for various types of bone diseases at the time of the Abgenix acquisition. There were no individually significant IPR&D projects acquired and written off in the acquisition of Avidia. We used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired IPR&D, which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs. These success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates. These cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 10%. The estimated after-tax cash flows were probability weighted at success rates of 38% for the Alantos product candidate, 77% for the Ilypsa product candidate, and 43% to 85% for the Abgenix product candidates. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approval for the Alantos and Ilypsa product candidates are immaterial. The incremental R&D expenses assumed to be incurred to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the various indications of panitumumab were estimated at the time of acquisition at approximately $300 million and would be incurred 77 Table of Contents through 2011. The elimination of the royalty on potential future sales of denosumab did not result in us incurring any incremental R&D expenses. The above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition. However, we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize, as estimated. The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization of these product candidates are our ability to confirm their safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. We are not able to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition. At the date of acquisition, we intended to develop panitumumab for treatment of various types of cancer. Panitumumab received FDA approval in late September 2006 for the treatment of mCRC after disease progression on, or following, fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens and is marketed under the trademark Vectibix . In December 2007, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for Vectibix as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFr expressing mCRC with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS genes after failure of standard chemotherapy regimens. We are continuing to develop or are evaluating plans to develop Vectibix in all of the remaining indications we had intended at the date of acquisition. However, since the acquisition, there have been several events that have affected the development plans for Vectibix , such as the results of our PACCE trial and KRAS biomarker analysis discussed in Item 1. Business Key Developments. Because of these developments, our expected time to obtain regulatory approvals for the remaining indications has been delayed compared to our original expectations. Our development efforts with respect to denosumab are continuing. In addition, we are continuing to develop the product candidates acquired in the Alantos and Ilypsa acquisitions. Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) As discussed in Note 2, Restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on August 15, 2007, we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure while continuing to make significant R&D investments and build the framework for our future growth. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded in Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) charges for staff separation costs of $209 million, asset impairments of $366 million and other charges of $119 million primarily related to the loss accruals for leases for certain R&D facilities that will not be used in our business. Also in 2007, the Company recorded in Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) a loss accrual for an ongoing commercial legal proceeding and recorded an expense of $34 million. In 2005, Other items (primarily certain restructuring costs in 2007) consisted of a $49 million charge, net of amounts previously accrued, for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding. Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 20.1%, 26.6% and 24.5% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the lesser amount of the write-off of nondeductible acquired IPR&D costs in 2007 than 2006 and the greater tax benefit from the favorable resolutions of our prior years income tax examinations in 2007 than 2006. Our effective tax rate for 2006 increased over 2005 primarily due to the write-off of non-deductible acquired IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisitions of Abgenix and Avidia. The increase in the rate was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States, the absence of tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act and favorable audit settlements. 78 Table of Contents As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion ( APB ) No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas , we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States. (See Note 5, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent and proposed accounting pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141(R), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141(R) ) and SFAS No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS 160 ). These standards will significantly change the accounting and reporting for business combination transactions and noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements, including capitalizing at the acquisition date the fair value of acquired IPR&D, and remeasuring and writing down these assets, if necessary, in subsequent periods during their development. These new standards will be applied prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after January 1, 2009, except that presentation and disclosure requirements of SFAS 160 regarding noncontrolling interests shall be applied retrospectively. In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Agreements ( EITF 07-1 ). EITF 07-1 provides guidance regarding financial statement presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements, as defined, which includes arrangements the Company has entered into regarding development and commercialization of products and product candidates. EITF 07-1 is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2009, and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF No. 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities ( EITF 07-3 ), which requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered in future R&D activities pursuant to executory contractual arrangements be deferred and recognized as an expense in the period that the related goods are delivered or services are performed. EITF No. 07-3 became effective as of January 1, 2008 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position upon adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 became effective as issued on January 1, 2008 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position upon adoption. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. ( FIN ) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition, measurement and classification in our consolidated financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For tax benefits to be recognized under FIN 48, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. There was no cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions upon adoption of FIN 48. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the balance sheet classification of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits ( UTBs ) as either current or non-current depending on the expected timing of payments. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we reclassified approximately $240 million of UTBs and related accrued interest from current income taxes payable to other non-current liabilities. Interest and penalties related to UTBs are classified as a component of our provision for income taxes. See Note 5, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In August 2007, the FASB exposed for public comment a proposed FSP that would change the method of accounting for convertible debt securities that requires or permits settlement in cash either in whole or in part upon conversion ( cash settled convertible debt securities ), which includes our convertible debt securities, and 79 Table of Contents would require the proposed method to be retrospectively applied. The FASB expects to begin deliberations on the proposed FSP in February 2008. The FSP, if issued as proposed, would become effective for calendar year end companies like us in the first quarter of 2008. Under this proposed method of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible debt securities would be bifurcated and accounted for separately in a manner that would result in recognizing interest on these securities at effective rates more comparable to what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms. The equity component of our convertible debt securities would be included in the paid-in-capital section of stockholders equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and, accordingly, the initial carrying values of these debt securities would be reduced. Our net income for financial reporting purposes would be reduced by recognizing the accretion of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt securities to their face amounts as additional non-cash interest expense. Therefore, if the proposed method of accounting for cash settled convertible debt securities is adopted by the FASB as described above, it would have an adverse impact on our past and future reported financial results. As the final guidance has not been issued, we cannot predict its ultimate outcome. We also cannot predict any other changes in GAAP that may be made affecting accounting for convertible debt securities, some of which could have an adverse impact on our past or future reported financial results. For additional discussion on this issue, see Item 1A. Risk Factors The accounting method for our convertible debt securities may be subject to change. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (in millions): December 31, 2007 2006 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 7,151 $ 6,277 Total assets 34,639 33,788 Current debt 2,000 1,798 Non-current debt 9,177 7,214 Stockholders equity 17,869 18,964 We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2007, approximately $6.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, we would be required to pay additional U.S. and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates. The primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. 80 Table of Contents Financing arrangements The following table reflects the carrying value of our long-term borrowings under our various financing arrangements as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in millions): 2007 2006 0.125% convertible notes due 2011 (2011 Convertible Notes) $ 2,500 $ 2,500 0.375% convertible notes due 2013 (2013 Convertible Notes) 2,500 2,500 Floating rate notes due 2008 (2008 Floating Rate Notes) 2,000 5.85% notes due 2017 (2017 Notes) 1,099 4.85% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) 1,000 1,000 4.00% notes due 2009 (2009 Notes) 999 999 6.375% notes due 2037 (2037 Notes) 899 Zero coupon 30 year modified convertible notes due in 2032 (2032 Modified Convertible Notes) 80 1,778 Other 100 235 Total borrowings 11,177 9,012 Less current portion 2,000 1,798 Total non-current debt $ 9,177 $ 7,214 In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due in November 2008 (the 2008 Floating Rate Notes ), $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2017 (the 2017 Notes ) and $900 million aggregate principal amount of notes due in 2037 (the 2037 Notes ) in a private placement. The 2008 Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 0.08%, which is reset quarterly. We may redeem the 2008 Floating Rate Notes, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued interest. The 2017 Notes and 2037 Notes pay interest at fixed annual rates of 5.85% and 6.375%, respectively. The 2017 Notes and 2037 Notes may be redeemed, in whole of from time to time in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest, if any, and a make-whole amount, as defined. In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined, we may be required to purchase for cash all or a portion of the 2008 Floating Rate Notes, the 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest. Debt issuance costs totaled approximately $16 million and are being amortized over the life of the notes. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under a block trade entered into in May 2007. In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Convertible Notes ) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the 2013 Convertible Notes ) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted (i) during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, (ii) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur or (iii) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive (i) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and (ii) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the excess conversion value ). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible 81 Table of Contents Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for approximately 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2011 and warrants for approximately 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2013 (the settlement dates ). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be net settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had $2.0 billion of long-term notes outstanding. These long-term notes consisted of (i) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% and mature in 2009 ( 2009 Note ) and (ii) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014 ( 2014 Note ). As of December 31, 2007, we had $180 million of additional debt securities outstanding. These debt securities consisted of (i) $100 million of long-term debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.125% and mature in 2097 ( Century Notes ) and (ii) zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 with an accreted value of $80 million and having an aggregate face amount of $105 million and yield to maturity of 1.125%. We have a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November 2012. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December 31, 2007. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement (the $1.0 Billion Shelf ) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1.0 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2007, no securities had been issued under the $1.0 Billion Shelf. We have a $400 million debt shelf registration statement whereby the debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. To achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for our 2009 Notes, 2014 Notes and Century Notes that effectively convert the payment of these fixed rate notes to LIBOR-based variable interest payments over the life of the respective notes. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate face amount of this outstanding fixed interest rate debt of $2.1 billion was covered by these interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate face amount of our outstanding fixed interest rate debt covered by interest rate swap agreements was $2.2 billion, including the 2009 Notes, 2014, Notes, Century Notes and $100 million of other notes that matured and were repaid during 2007 at which time the interest rate swap agreement matured. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December 31, 2007 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. None of our financing arrangements contain any financial 82 Table of Contents covenants. Our outstanding convertible notes and other long-term debt are rated A+ with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor and A2 with a negative outlook by Moody Investors Service, Inc. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,401 $ 5,389 $ 4,911 Net cash used in investing activities (1,992 ) (5,131 ) (59 ) Net cash used in financing activities (2,668 ) (815 ) (4,538 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 remained relatively unchanged as higher cash receipts from customers were substantially offset by the timing of payments in the ordinary course of business (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows ). The increase in cash provided by operations for 2006 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows ). Investing On July 18, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Ilypsa and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $398 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $2 million. On July 16, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Alantos and pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid $299 million in cash, net of cash acquired and transaction costs of $1 million. On October 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Avidia and paid $275 million in cash, net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in Avidia. In addition, we may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events. On April, 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Abgenix and paid $2.1 billion in cash to the shareholders of Abgenix to acquire all outstanding shares. In addition, we acquired $252 million in cash, and subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we paid off $653 million of debt assumed in this transaction. Capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in 2007 compared with $1.2 billion in 2006 and $867 million in 2005. Capital expenditures in 2007 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Puerto Rico and other locations and investment in our global ERP system. Capital expenditures in 2006 were primarily associated with manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Ireland, Puerto Rico and other locations and costs associated with implementing our ERP system. Capital expenditures in 2005 primarily related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of Neulasta and NEUPOGEN approved by the FDA in September 2005, Thousand Oaks site expansion, Colorado manufacturing expansion and site development to support the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, also approved by the FDA in September 2005. We currently estimate 2008 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $1.0 billion. Financing In December 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of common stock. Additionally, in July 2007, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had $6.4 billion available for stock repurchases under these authorized stock repurchase programs. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we 83 Table of Contents are restricted from repurchasing shares, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 8.8 $ 537 46.6 $ 3,374 26.8 $ 1,675 Second quarter 73.9 (1) 4,463 13.0 876 12.1 750 Third quarter 2.5 (1) 7.3 505 9.5 769 Fourth quarter 1.8 100 3.3 245 14.8 1,236 Total 87.0 $ 5,100 70.2 $ 5,000 63.2 $ 4,430 (1) The total number of shares repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2007 excludes 2.5 million shares received in July 2007 in connection with the final settlement of a block trade entered into in May 2007. (See Item 5(c). Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.) In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2008 Floating Rate Notes, $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.85% notes due in 2017 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% notes due in 2037. The 2008 Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to LIBOR plus 0.08%, which is reset quarterly. A total of $3.2 billion of the net proceeds raised from the issuance of these notes were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under a block trade entered into in May 2007. For further information on these transactions, see Financing arrangements above. On March 2, 2007, as a result of holders of substantially all of our outstanding 2032 Modified Convertible Notes exercising their March 1, 2007 put option, we repurchased $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount, or the majority of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.7 billion in cash. In December 2007, $100 million of debt securities matured and were repaid. In October 2007, $35 million of debt securities were repaid. In February 2006, we issued $5.0 billion convertible notes, of which $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125% and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375% and are due in 2013. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of these convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. The net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May 2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May 2013. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 exercising their March 1, 2005 put option, we repurchased $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount or approximately 40% of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1.2 billion in cash. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $277 million, $528 million and $1.1 billion of cash during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. 84 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations (1) $ 14,722 $ 2,306 $ 1,384 $ 2,958 (2) $ 8,074 Operating lease obligations 1,231 144 256 200 631 Purchase obligations (3) 2,689 1,309 975 378 27 Unrecognized tax benefits (4) 300 300 Total contractual obligations $ 18,942 $ 4,059 $ 2,615 $ 3,536 $ 8,732 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2009 Notes, the 2011 Convertible Notes, the 2013 Convertible Notes, the 2014 Notes, 2017 Notes, 2037 Notes and the Century Notes at fixed rates of, 4.00%, 0.125%, 0.375%, 4.85%, 5.85%, 6.375% and 8.125%, respectively. We used an interest rate forward curve at December 31, 2007 to compute the amount of the future interest payments on our variable rate 2008 Floating Rate Note and interest rate swaps. (2) Holders of the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates, the next of which is March 1, 2012, at the then-accreted value. Consequently, the amount above reflects the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes accreted value on March 1, 2012, the next put date. (See Note 6, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (i) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (ii) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (iii) capital expenditures and (iv) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (4) In addition to the current liabilities for UTBs included in the table above, long-term liabilities for UTBs (net of federal tax benefits on state taxes) and related accrued interest totaling approximately $600 million at December 31, 2007 are not included in the contractual obligations table because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. In addition to the above table, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third-parties as part of in-licensing and product development programs all of which are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development milestones, regulatory 85 Table of Contents approvals and product sales. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been included in the above table or recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Individually, these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period. However, if the achievement of the milestones covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the resulting payment obligation would be approximately $1.5 billion. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other incentives (collectively sales incentives ) and returns. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives were comprised of the following (dollar amounts in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Rebates $ 2,156 $ 2,164 $ 1,344 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,649 1,636 1,559 Discounts and other incentives 694 653 891 Total sales incentives $ 4,499 $ 4,453 $ 3,794 Percent of gross product sales 24 % 24 % 24 % Rebates earned in the United States by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers and hospitals are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are generally performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually-specified sales volumes and segment share. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $2.2 billion in 2007, $2.2 billion in 2006 and $1.3 billion in 2005. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior 86 Table of Contents annual periods have been less than 1.5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods. These changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 1.5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2007 would have had an impact of approximately $32 million on our 2007 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1.6 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (in millions): Balance at Beginning of Period Amounts Charged Against Product Sales (1) Payments Balance at End of Period Year ended: December 31, 2007 $ 1,079 $ 4,499 $ 4,514 $ 1,064 December 31, 2006 $ 864 $ 4,453 $ 4,238 $ 1,079 (1) Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented approximately 1% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both 2007 and 2006. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales. Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 10, Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. 87 Table of Contents In addition, our income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.
