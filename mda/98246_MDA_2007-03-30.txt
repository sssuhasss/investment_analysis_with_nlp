Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to the fiscal year that ends on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY GROWTH STRATEGIES The Company key growth strategies are: To selectively expand its channels of distribution in important markets around the world without compromising the value of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark; To provide superior customer service; To maintain an active product development program; To increase its control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing; To achieve improved profit margins; and To enhance customer awareness through marketing and public relations programs. 2006 HIGHLIGHTS Net sales increased 11% to $2.6 billion due to growth in all channels of distribution. Worldwide comparable store sales increased 6% on a constant-exchange-rate basis (see Non-GAAP Measures). Comparable TIFFANY & CO. store sales in the U.S. increased 5%. Comparable international store sales increased 8%. Growth in most countries more than offset weakness in Japan. Net earnings of $254 million were approximately equal to the prior year, although earnings before income taxes increased 10%. Net earnings in 2005 included non-recurring tax benefits related to the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net earnings per diluted share rose 3% due to fewer shares outstanding. The Board of Directors authorized increased repurchases of Common Stock and extended the expiration of the repurchase program. The Company repurchased 8.1 million shares of its Common Stock in 2006. The number of Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores and boutiques increased 8%. The Company added 16 retail locations: five in the U.S., four in Japan, three in China and one each in Mexico, Korea, Austria and Canada. Three existing locations were closed: two in Japan and one in Korea. The Company introduced a wide range of new products, highlighted by the launch of jewelry designed by Frank Gehry, the world-renowned architect. The Company launched an informational website in China. The Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend rate by 25%. t i f f a n y & c o . K - 2 7 NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company reported sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ). Internally, management monitors its international sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars ( constant-exchange-rate basis ). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate measure provides a more representative assessment of the sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The Company management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company operating results. The following table reconciles sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2006 2005 Constant- Constant- GAAP Translation Exchange- GAAP Translation Exchange- Reported Effect Rate Basis Reported Effect Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 11 % 11 % 9 % 9 % U.S. Retail 9 % 9 % 9 % 9 % International Retail 12 % (1 )% 13 % 5 % (2 )% 7 % Japan Retail (1 )% (5 )% 4 % (4 )% 4 % Other Asia-Pacific 25 % 2 % 23 % 17 % 3 % 14 % Europe 28 % 5 % 23 % 4 % (3 )% 7 % Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide 6 % 6 % 4 % (1 )% 5 % U.S. Retail 5 % 5 % 7 % 7 % International Retail 7 % (1 )% 8 % (2 )% 2 % Japan Retail (4 )% (4 )% (4 )% (4 )% Other Asia-Pacific 24 % 2 % 22 % 10 % 2 % 8 % Europe 25 % 5 % 20 % (2 )% (3 )% 1 % t i f f a n y & c o . K - 2 8 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Certain operating data as a percentage of net sales were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 44.3 44.0 44.2 Gross profit 55.7 56.0 55.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 40.0 40.1 42.4 Earnings from operations 15.7 15.9 13.4 Interest expense, financing costs and other income, net 0.4 0.5 0.8 Gain on sale of equity investment 8.8 Earnings before income taxes 15.3 15.4 21.4 Provision for income taxes 5.7 4.8 7.6 Net earnings 9.6 % 10.6 % 13.8 % Net Sales 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Increase Increase U.S. Retail $ 1,326,441 $ 1,220,683 $ 1,116,845 9 % 9 % International Retail 1,010,627 900,689 857,360 12 % 5 % Direct Marketing 174,078 157,483 142,508 11 % 11 % Other 137,175 116,298 88,118 18 % 32 % $ 2,648,321 $ 2,395,153 $ 2,204,831 11 % 9 % A store sales are included in comparable store sales when the store has been open for more than 12 months. In markets except Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan, sales for a new store or boutique are not included if the store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. U.S. Retail . U.S. Retail includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.S. and sales of TIFFANY & CO. products through business-to-business direct selling operations in the U.S. The following table presents the U.S. Retail channel and its components as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2006 2005 2004 New York Flagship store 9 % 10 % 10 % Branch stores 39 % 39 % 39 % Business-to-business 2 % 2 % 2 % 50 % 51 % 51 % U.S. Retail sales increased in 2006 and 2005 as a result of comparable store sales growth of 5% and 7% in 2006 and 2005 and the opening of new stores. In 2006 and 2005, the New York Flagship store sales increased 9% and 5% and comparable branch store sales increased 4% and 7%. Comparable store sales t i f f a n y & c o . K - 2 9 growth in both years resulted from increases in the average sales amount per transaction. Management attributes the increased amount per transaction to sales of higher-priced merchandise as well as generally favorable conditions for consumer spending. In 2006 and 2005, the Company experienced growth across a range of jewelry categories, with especially strong results in jewelry with diamonds. The Company opened five new U.S. stores in 2006 and four new U.S. stores in 2005. International Retail. International Retail includes sales in TIFFANY & CO. stores and department store boutiques outside the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, business-to-business, Internet and wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. products outside the U.S. The following table presents the sales contribution in U.S. dollars of each geographic region within the International Retail channel as a percentage of worldwide net sales: 2006 2005 2004 Japan 19 % 20 % 22 % Other Asia-Pacific 9 % 8 % 7 % Europe 7 % 6 % 6 % Other International 3 % 4 % 4 % 38 % 38 % 39 % International Retail sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, increased 13% in 2006 and 7% in 2005, and comparable store sales rose 8% in 2006 and 2% in 2005. When compared with the prior year, the weighted-average U.S. dollar exchange rate was stronger in both 2006 and 2005. Japan retail sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, increased 4% in both 2006 and 2005 due to an increase in unit sales of engagement and other fine jewelry. Comparable store sales were unchanged in both years. Management operational focus in Japan is to increase sales by improving the in-store shopping experience and cultivating more long-term customer relationships, while also upgrading certain boutiques through renovation or relocation. In addition, management believes that Japan sales will continue to be affected by increased luxury-goods competition. In 2006, the Company opened four locations in Japan and closed two. In 2005, the Company opened two locations and five were closed. The store closings are consistent with management intention to enhance the quality of its selling locations in Japan. The Company also launched an e-commerce website in 2005. In the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan, comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 22% in 2006 and 8% in 2005 due to growth in most markets. In Europe, comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increased 20% in 2006 due to growth in all markets including the United Kingdom (which represents more than half of European sales) and 1% in 2005. Store Data . Gross square feet of Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores increased 6% to 792,000 in 2006, following a 2% increase to 745,000 in 2005. Sales per gross square foot generated by those stores were $2,746 in 2006, $2,666 in 2005 and $2,546 in 2004. The Company newer U.S. stores use a smaller footprint and are more productive than the Company average. Management objective is to increase sales per square foot by improving customer traffic through more targeted advertising and improving the conversion rate through continued sales training initiatives. Given the success of new stores opened in recent years, management has adopted a more aggressive program for store openings. The Company revised worldwide expansion strategy is to add 15-17 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores and boutiques annually. Beginning in 2007, the Company expects to add 5-7 new U.S. stores and approximately 10 international stores t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 0 each year. 2007 store openings announced to date for the U.S. are: Austin, Texas, Wall Street, New York City, Las Vegas, Nevada (the second store in that market), Natick, Massachusetts and Red Bank, New Jersey. 2007 openings announced to date for non-U.S. markets are stores in: Japan, Singapore, Korea, Germany and Mexico. Direct Marketing. Direct Marketing includes Internet and catalog sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in the U.S. Direct Marketing sales rose in both 2006 and 2005 due to increases in both the number of orders shipped and the average order size. Website traffic and orders have continued to increase as consumers have shifted their purchases from catalogs to the Internet. Catalogs remain an effective marketing tool for both retail and Internet sales, but the Company has reduced catalog circulation and in 2006 began e-mail marketing communications to customers. Other. Other includes worldwide sales of businesses operated under trademarks or tradenames other than TIFFANY & CO. ( specialty retail ). Other also includes wholesale sales of diamonds obtained through bulk purchases deemed not suitable for the Company needs. Other sales increased in 2006 and 2005. More than half of the increase resulted from wholesale sales of diamonds. Sales in LITTLE SWITZERLAND stores (which represent the majority of Other sales) increased 6% in 2006 and 7% in 2005. IRIDESSE store sales increased in both years largely due to an increased store base. Gross Margin Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) declined in 2006 by 0.3 percentage point and improved in 2005 by 0.2 percentage point. The primary components of the net decline in 2006 were: (i) a 0.4 percentage point decline due to increased low-margin wholesale sales of diamonds; (ii) a 0.3 percentage point decline due to changes in product sales mix and increased product costs; which was partially offset by (iii) a 0.5 percentage point improvement due to the leverage effect of fixed product-related costs, which includes costs associated with merchandising and distribution. The increase in 2005 was primarily attributable to changes in geographic and product sales mix and selective price increases (0.6 percentage point), partially offset by increased low-margin wholesale sales of diamonds (0.5 percentage point). Wholesale diamond sales are made to divest gemstones that do not meet Tiffany quality requirements; typically, the Company purchases such gemstones in mixed lots which are then culled. The Company hedging program (see note K to consolidated financial statements) uses yen put options to stabilize product costs in Japan over the short-term despite exchange rate fluctuations. The Company adjusts its retail prices in Japan from time to time to address longer-term changes in the yen/dollar relationship and local competitive pricing. Management objective is to improve gross margin through greater product manufacturing/sourcing efficiencies (including increased direct rough-diamond sourcing and internal manufacturing), increased utilization of distribution center capacity, and selective price adjustments to address higher product costs. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses SG&A expenses increased $100,605,000, or 10%, in 2006 largely due to increased labor and benefit costs of $31,400,000 and increased depreciation and occupancy expenses of $25,900,000, which is largely due to new and existing stores. In addition, marketing expenses increased $25,800,000, which included the launch of the Frank Gehry jewelry collection. In 2006, the Company recorded total charges of $6,893,000 related to the impairment of goodwill for its Little Switzerland business as a result of store performance and cash flow projections (see note E to consolidated financial statements). Despite increasing the t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 1 advertising-to-sales ratio from 5.7% in 2005 to 6.2% in 2006, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by 0.1 percentage point in 2006. SG&A expenses increased $23,591,000, or 3%, in 2005. However, excluding several one-time costs in 2004 (a $25,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation, a $12,193,000 impairment charge and $2,932,000 of exit costs associated with discontinuing a specialty retail concept that the Company decided not to pursue), SG&A expenses would have increased 7% in 2005 due to higher labor and benefit costs (representing $33,400,000 of the increase) and higher depreciation and occupancy expenses attributable to new stores and variable rent (representing $19,200,000 of the increase). In addition, in 2005, the Company recorded $2,201,000 of losses associated with the sale of the Company equity investment in a retail designer and distributor and $2,115,000 of losses associated with the sale of a glassware manufacturing operation. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses improved 2.3 percentage points in 2005. Excluding the one-time costs in 2004 discussed above, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales would have improved 0.5 percentage point in 2005 due to overall sales growth. Management objective is to improve the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales by controlling expenses so that sales growth can result in a higher rate of earnings growth. Earnings from Operations % of % of % of (in thousands) 2006 Sales* 2005 Sales* 2004 Sales* Earnings (losses) from operations: U.S. Retail $ 260,067 20 % $ 265,425 22 % $ 217,882 20 % International Retail 259,116 26 % 216,273 24 % 213,411 25 % Direct Marketing 62,580 36 % 58,109 37 % 45,835 32 % Other (29,344 ) (21 )% (18,829 ) (16 )% (23,290 ) (26 )% 552,419 520,978 453,838 Unallocated corporate expenses (136,984 ) (138,273 ) (159,309 ) Earnings from operations $ 415,435 $ 382,705 $ 294,529 *Percentages represent earnings (losses) from operations as a percentage of each segment net sales. Reclassifications were made to the prior years earnings (losses) from operations by segment to conform to the current year presentation and to reflect the revised manner in which management evaluates the performance of segments (see note R to consolidated financial statements for further information on the reclassifications that were made). Earnings from operations rose 9% in 2006. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations (before the effect of unallocated corporate expenses and interest expense, financing costs and other income, net) to each segment net sales in 2006 compared with 2005 was as follows: U.S. Retail decreased 2 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin (due to higher product costs) and increased SG&A expenses (due to new and existing stores as well as increased marketing expenses); International Retail increased 2 percentage points primarily due to an improved gross margin (due to the leveraging of product-related costs) and the leveraging of operating expenses which benefited from increased sales growth; Direct Marketing decreased 1 percentage point primarily due to a decline in gross margin (due to higher product costs); and t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 2 Other increased loss of 5 percentage points primarily due to continued investments in the development of the specialty retail businesses and greater than expected losses from the Little Switzerland business, including a $6,893,000 loss related to the impairment of all goodwill. 2005 included losses associated with business dispositions. Earnings from operations rose 30% in 2005. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations (before the effect of unallocated corporate expenses and interest expense, financing costs and other income, net) to each segment net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was as follows: U.S. Retail increased 2 percentage points primarily due to increased sales and gross margin and the leveraging of fixed expenses; International Retail decreased 1 percentage point primarily due to a decline in gross margin (due to increased product costs); Direct Marketing increased 5 percentage points primarily due to increased sales and gross margin and the leveraging of fixed expenses; and Other reduced loss of 10 percentage points primarily due to the absence of impairment and exit costs incurred in 2004. Excluding these charges from the 2004 loss from operations, the ratio of losses from operations to net sales in 2005 would have been equal to 2004. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to the Company administrative support functions, such as information technology, finance, legal and human resources. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased 1% in 2006 and 13% in 2005. The 13% decrease in 2005 was primarily due to the $25,000,000 contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation made in 2004, which was partially offset by incremental labor and benefit costs. Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense in 2006 was higher than 2005 primarily due to increased borrowings to support inventory growth and share repurchases. Interest expense in 2005 was slightly higher than 2004. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions, and minority interest income/expense. Other income, net increased in 2006 and 2005. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to (i) $6,774,000 of gains associated with the sale of equity investments and marketable securities; (ii) increased interest income; partially offset by (iii) a change of $4,080,000 in foreign currency transaction gains/losses. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased interest income associated with a higher level of average investments and higher interest rates, as well as transaction gains on settlement of foreign payables. Gain on Sale of Equity Investment In December 2004, the Company sold its entire investment holdings of eight million shares in Aber Diamond Corporation ( Aber ), which had been acquired in July 1999, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $193,597,000, or a gain of $125,064,000 net of tax (see Liquidity and Capital Resources). t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 3 Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 37.2% in 2006, compared with 30.8% in 2005 and 35.6% in 2004. The lower effective tax rates in 2005 and 2004 primarily reflected tax benefits associated with the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( AJCA ). The 2004 rate also benefited from the favorable state tax treatment on the gain from the Company sale of its equity investment in Aber. The AJCA, which was signed into law on October 22, 2004, created a temporary incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The incentive effectively reduced the amount of U.S. Federal income tax due on repatriation. Taking advantage of the AJCA, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $8,600,000 in 2004 to reflect the Company plan to repatriate $100,000,000 of accumulated foreign earnings. In 2005, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $22,588,000 due to the Internal Revenue Service clarifying certain provisions of the AJCA in May 2005, which also resulted in the Company decision to repatriate additional foreign earnings. The tax benefit to the Company occurred because the Company had previously accrued income taxes on un-repatriated foreign earnings at statutory tax rates. In total, the Company repatriated $178,245,000 of accumulated foreign earnings. 2007 Outlook Management financial performance objectives for 2007 are based on the following assumptions and should be read in conjunction with Item 1A Risk Factors on page K-18: Net sales growth of 11%-12%. This objective assumes a high-single-digit percentage increase in worldwide comparable store sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis, including a high-single-digit percentage increase in both the U.S. and internationally. It also assumes adding 17 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores. An increase in the operating margin primarily due to an improvement in gross margin as a result of a stabilization of product costs, favorable sales mix and the leverage of fixed costs against sales growth. Other expenses, net of approximately $21 million-$23 million. An increase in the effective tax rate to 38%. Net earnings per diluted share growth of 15%. Net inventories increasing by a high-single-digit percentage. Capital expenditures of approximately $180 million. t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 4 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders equity was 29% and 26% at January 31, 2007 and 2006. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 233,582 $ 262,691 $ 130,853 Investing activities (204,979) 31,943 (30,265) Financing activities (248,871) (85,151) (163,937) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 3,162 (3,555) 2,365 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (217,106) $ 205,928 $ (60,984) Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $233,582,000 in 2006, $262,691,000 in 2005 and $130,853,000 in 2004. The decrease in 2006 resulted from higher inventory purchases, partly offset by increased net earnings after adjustment for non-cash items and lower payments for taxes made in 2006 (in 2005 payments for taxes were higher due to the gain on the sale of the Company equity investment in Aber). Increased net cash inflows in 2005 resulted from increased net earnings after adjustment for non-cash items and smaller growth in inventories, partly offset by increased tax payments largely associated with a gain recognized on the sale of the Company equity investment in Aber in the fourth quarter of 2004. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $1,253,973,000 and 3.8 at January 31, 2007, compared with $1,334,233,000 and 4.7 at January 31, 2006. Accounts receivable, less allowances, at January 31, 2007 were 19% higher than January 31, 2006 due to sales growth, a shift in credit card usage toward the Company in-house card and an increase in reimbursements from landlords related to new store build-outs. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 18 times in 2006 and 19 times in 2005. Inventories, net at January 31, 2007 were 15% above January 31, 2006. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories increased 26% due to expanded diamond sourcing operations, as well as higher precious metal costs. Finished goods inventories increased 10% reflecting store openings, broadened product assortments and higher costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant effect on the change in inventory balances from January 31, 2006. t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 5 Investing Activities The Company had a net cash outflow from investing activities of $204,979,000 in 2006, a net cash inflow of $31,943,000 in 2005 and a net cash outflow of $30,265,000 in 2004. Investing activities in 2005 included higher net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments and proceeds from the sale-leaseback of assets. Investing activities in 2004 included the proceeds from the sale of an equity investment. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $182,393,000 in 2006, $157,036,000 in 2005 and $142,321,000 in 2004, representing 7%, 7% and 6% of net sales in those respective years. In all three years, expenditures were primarily related to the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution facilities and ongoing investments in new systems. In 2002, the Company acquired the property housing its Flagship store on Old Bond Street in London and an adjacent building, in order to renovate and reconfigure the interior retail selling space. Construction commenced in 2004 and was completed in 2006 at a cost of approximately $36,000,000. In 2000, the Company began a multi-year project to renovate and reconfigure its New York Flagship store in order to increase the total sales area by approximately 25% and to provide additional space for customer service, customer hospitality and special exhibitions. The increase in the sales area was completed in 2001 when the renovated second floor opened to provide an expanded presentation of engagement and other jewelry. The renovated sixth floor that now houses the customer service department opened in 2002. The renovated fourth floor that offers tableware merchandise opened in 2003. The renovated third floor with silver jewelry and accessories opened in 2004. In conjunction with the New York store project, the Company relocated its after-sales service functions and several of its administrative functions. The Company completed the project in 2006 with the renovation of the main floor, for a total cost of approximately $110,000,000. Acquisitions, Investments and Dispositions. In October 2005, the Company acquired a corporation that specializes in polishing small carat weight diamonds. The price payable by the Company for the entire equity interest in this corporation is $2,000,000, of which $1,200,000 was paid in 2005 and $400,000 in 2006; the balance will be paid when certain post-acquisition requirements are satisfied but no later than a fixed due date. This acquisition was not significant to the Company financial position, earnings or cash flows. The Company made a $10,000,000 investment ($4,500,000 in 2004 and $5,500,000 in 2005) in a joint venture that owns and operates a diamond polishing facility. The Company interest in, and control over, this venture are such that its results are consolidated with those of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company expects, through its investment, to gain access to additional supplies of diamonds that meet its quality standards. In December 2004, the Company sold its entire investment in Aber through a private offering. To gain Aber consent to the sale, the Company paid a fee and ceded its right to representation on Aber Board of Directors. Aber, in turn, paid the Company the present value of the right to purchase diamonds at a discount, under a purchase agreement, which obligates the Company to purchase, subject to availability and the Company quality standards, a minimum of $50,000,000 of diamonds per year through 2013. Inclusive of the payments described above, the Company received proceeds of $278,081,000, net of investment banking and legal fees, related to the sale of its equity investment. A pre-tax gain of $193,597,000 was recognized on the sale of the stock, and $10,843,000 related to the present value of the discount under the purchase agreement was deferred. As the deferred amount represents the present value of the discount, interest will be recorded on the deferred amount, and the undiscounted amount t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 6 will be recognized as a reduction of inventory costs. The Company used $25,000,000 of the proceeds for a charitable contribution to The Tiffany & Co. Foundation; management used the balance for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and additional investments to secure a greater supply of rough diamonds. The Company continues to maintain its commercial relationship with Aber through the diamond purchase agreement. In December 2002, the Company made a $4,000,000 investment in a privately-held company that designs and sells jewelry. In 2004 and 2003, the Company made additional investments of $2,500,000 and $4,500,000. In October 2005, the Company sold its equity interest and recorded a loss of $2,201,000 in SG&A expenses. Prior to the sale of the equity interest, the Company consolidated those results in its financial statements based on the percentage of ownership and effective control over the direction of the operations of the business. In September 2005, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement for its Retail Service Center, a distribution and administrative office facility. The Company received proceeds of $75,000,000 resulting in a gain of $5,300,000, which has been deferred and is being amortized over the lease term. The lease has been accounted for as an operating lease. The lease expires in 2025 and has two ten-year renewal options. The Company continuously evaluates its manufacturing operations and supply chain to ensure that it has the optimal production mix to support long-term growth needs. In August 2005, the Company sold a glassware manufacturing operation. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $2,115,000 in SG&A expenses associated with the sale of the operation. Marketable Securities. The Company invests excess cash in short-term investments and marketable securities. The Company had (net purchases of) or net proceeds from investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of ($13,063,000), $147,994,000 and ($146,470,000) during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $248,871,000 in 2006, $85,151,000 in 2005 and $163,937,000 in 2004. Financing activities reflected progressively increased share repurchases and changes in borrowings. Dividends. Cash dividends paid were $52,611,000 in 2006, $42,903,000 in 2005 and $33,569,000 in 2004. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 21% in 2006, 17% in 2005 and 11% in 2004. In May 2006, the Company Board of Directors declared a 25% increase in the quarterly rate on common shares, increasing it from $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share. In May 2005, the Company Board of Directors declared a 33% increase in the quarterly dividend rate on common shares, increasing it from $0.06 per share to $0.08 per share. In May 2004, the Company Board of Directors declared a 20% increase in the quarterly dividend rate on common shares, increasing it from $0.05 per share to $0.06 per share. Stock Repurchases. In March 2005, the Company Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program ( 2005 Program ) that authorized the repurchase of up to $400,000,000 of the Company Common Stock through March 2007 by means of open market or private transactions. The 2005 Program replaced and terminated an earlier program. In August 2006, the Company Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the Company 2005 Program to December 2009, and authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $700,000,000 of the Company Common Stock through open market or private t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 7 transactions. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depend on a variety of discretionary factors such as price and other market conditions. The Company stock repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 2004 Cost of repurchases $ 281,176 $ 132,816 $ 86,732 Shares repurchased and retired 8,149 3,835 2,735 Average cost per share $ 34.50 $ 34.63 $ 31.71 At January 31, 2007, there remained $695,414,000 of authorization for future repurchases. At least annually, the Company Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flow and capital requirements for expansion. Recent Borrowings. The Company current sources of working capital are internally-generated cash flows and borrowings available under a revolving credit facility. In July 2005, the Company entered into a new $300,000,000 revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility ) and, in October 2006, exercised its option to increase the Credit Facility by $150,000,000 to $450,000,000. The Company has the option to increase such commitments to $500,000,000. The Credit Facility is available for working capital and other corporate purposes and contains covenants that require maintenance of certain debt/equity and interest-coverage ratios, in addition to other requirements customary to loan facilities of this nature. Borrowings may be made from eight participating banks and are at interest rates based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin that fluctuates with the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. The weighted-average interest rate at January 31, 2007 and 2006 was 2.44% and 3.59%. The Credit Facility expires in July 2010. In January 2006, the Company borrowed HKD 300,000,000 ($38,672,000 at issuance) ( Hong Kong Term Loan ), SGD 13,100,000 ($8,043,000 at issuance) ( Singapore Term Loan ) and CHF 19,500,000 ($15,145,000 at issuance) ( Switzerland Term Loan ) due in January 2011. These funds were used to partially finance the repatriation of dividends related to the AJCA (see Provision for Income Taxes above). Principal payments of 10% of the original principal amount are due each year, with the balance due upon maturity. Amounts may be prepaid without incurring penalties. The covenants of the term loans are similar to the Credit Facility. Interest rates are based upon local currency borrowing rates plus a margin that fluctuates with the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. In 2006, the Singapore Term Loan was paid in full with existing funds. The interest rates for the Hong Kong Term Loan and the Switzerland Term Loan were 4.28% and 2.40%, respectively, at January 31, 2007 and 4.28% and 1.28%, respectively, at January 31, 2006. The interest rate for the Singapore Term Loan was 3.65% at January 31, 2006. In October 2004, the Company obligation to repay a yen 5,500,000,000 ($51,530,000 at maturity) borrowing came due and was paid in full, primarily with proceeds from a new yen 5,000,000,000 short-term loan. The yen 5,000,000,000 ($46,845,000 at issuance) short-term loan agreement was entered into in October 2004, had an interest rate of 0.59%, came due in January 2005 and was paid in full with existing funds. At January 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 8 Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2007: (in thousands) Total 2007 2008-2009 2010-2011 Thereafter Operating leases $ 772,828 $ 100,920 $ 176,663 $ 144,233 $ 351,012 Inventory purchase obligations 424,707 124,707 100,000 100,000 100,000 Short-term borrowings 106,681 106,681 Long-term debt 411,781 5,398 110,502 236,033 59,848 Interest on debt and interest- rate swap agreements a 72,310 19,701 33,338 17,266 2,005 Construction-in-progress 19,722 19,062 180 180 300 Non-inventory purchase obligations 9,715 9,715 Other contractual obligations b 9,358 7,611 1,297 450 $ 1,827,102 $ 393,795 $ 421,980 $ 498,162 $ 513,165 a) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company working capital needs. Variable-rate interest payments were estimated based on rates at January 31, 2007. Actual payments will differ based on changes in interest rates. b) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of royalty and maintenance commitments. The summary above does not include cash contributions for the Company pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $15,000,000 to the pension plan in 2007. However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $1,227,000 in 2007. In addition, the summary above does not include the credit facility that the Company is providing to Tahera Diamond Corporation ( Tahera ), see below. The following is a summary of the Company outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Credit Facility and other lines of credit at January 31, 2007: Total Borrowings Available (in thousands) capacity outstanding capacity Credit Facility* $ 450,000 $ 106,681 $ 343,319 Other lines of credit 13,829 13,829 $ 463,829 $ 106,681 $ 357,148 *This facility matures in July 2010 and the capacity may be increased to $500,000,000. In addition, the Company had letters of credit and financial guarantees of $20,386,000 at January 31, 2007, of which $19,431,000 expires within one year. In November 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Tahera, a Canadian diamond mining and exploration company, to purchase or market all of the diamonds to be mined at the Jericho mine, which has been developed and constructed by Tahera in Nunavut, Canada (the Project ). In consideration of that agreement, the Company provided a credit facility to Tahera which allows Tahera to draw up to CDN$35,000,000 (U.S. $29,653,000 at January 31, 2007) to finance the development and t i f f a n y & c o . K - 3 9 construction of the Project. This credit facility matures in December 2013. In 2006, the credit facility was amended to defer the start of principal and interest payments until September 2007 and to include a working capital loan commitment of CDN$8,000,000 (U.S. $6,778,000 at January 31, 2007), which can be borrowed against until December 2007. At January 31, 2007, CDN$44,044,000 (U.S. $37,315,000 at January 31, 2007), including accrued interest of CDN$3,506,000 (U.S. $2,970,000 at January 31, 2007), was outstanding under the credit facility and working capital loan commitment. The Company began purchasing diamonds from Tahera in 2006. Based on the Company financial position at January 31, 2007, management anticipates that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows and the funds available under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to support the Company planned worldwide business expansion, share repurchases, debt service and seasonal working capital increases for the foreseeable future. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing a proportionally greater percentage of annual sales, earnings from operations and cash flow. Management expects such seasonality to continue. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records the effect of any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2007, a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $2,235,000 in inventory and cost of sales. The Company domestic and foreign branch inventories, excluding Japan, are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, and inventories held by foreign subsidiaries and Japan are valued using the average cost method. Fluctuation in inventory levels, along with the costs of raw materials, could affect the carrying value of the Company inventory. Long-lived assets . The Company long-lived assets are primarily property, plant and equipment. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset t i f f a n y & c o . K - 4 0 and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company recorded impairment charges of $10,230,000 in 2004 and did not record any impairment charges in 2006 or 2005. Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The Company recorded impairment charges of $6,893,000 in 2006 and $1,963,000 in 2004. The 2005 evaluation resulted in no impairment charges. Income taxes . Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ( tax filing positions ). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company various tax filing positions, management records reserves for probable exposures. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. The Company also records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for current and retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used a discount rate of 5.75% to determine its 2006 pension and postretirement expense for all U.S. plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2006 pension and postretirement expenses by $3,640,000 and $201,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2006 pension and postretirement expenses by $4,106,000 and $213,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2006 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2006 pension expense by $780,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, the following annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2007: 9.00% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 10.00% (for post-age 65 retirees). The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2016 (for pre-age 65 retirees) and by 2018 (for post-age 65 retirees) and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would have increased the aggregate service and t i f f a n y & c o . K - 4 1 interest cost components of the 2006 postretirement expense by $466,000. Decreasing the assumed health-care cost trend rate by one-percentage-point would have decreased the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2006 postretirement expense by $357,000.
