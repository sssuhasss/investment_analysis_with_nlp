ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Information We provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States ( U.S. ) and around the world. On October 29, 2008 (the Closing Date ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged (the Merger ) with and into Northwest Airlines Corporation. On the Closing Date, Northwest Airlines Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Northwest Airlines, Inc. (collectively, Northwest ), became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delta. On December 31, 2009, Northwest Airlines, Inc. merged with and into Delta. As a result of this merger, Northwest Airlines, Inc. ceased to exist as a separate entity. Results of Operations 2010 Compared to 2009 We reported net income of $593 million for 2010, compared to a net loss of $1.2 billion for 2009. This $1.8 billion improvement primarily reflects a strengthening of the airline industry revenue environment. In 2010, we recorded special items totaling $851 million in expenses, including $450 million of restructuring and merger-related items and $401 million primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt. In 2009, our special items totaled $169 million in net expenses. Operating margin excluding special items (a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Supplemental Information below) was 8.4% in 2010, compared to 0.3% in 2009. Operating Revenue % Year Ended December 31, Increase Increase (in millions) 2010 2009 (Decrease) (Decrease) Passenger: Mainline $ 21,408 $ 18,522 $ 2,886 16 % Regional carriers 5,850 5,285 565 11 % Total passenger revenue 27,258 23,807 3,451 14 % Cargo 850 788 62 8 % Other 3,647 3,468 179 5 % Total operating revenue $ 31,755 $ 28,063 $ 3,692 13 % Increase (Decrease) vs. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Passenger Year Ended Passenger RPMs ASMs Mile Load (in millions) December 31, 2010 Revenue (Traffic) (Capacity) Yield PRASM Factor Domestic $ 11,878 11 % 1 % 2 % 9 % 9 % (0.3)pts Atlantic 5,152 18 % 0 % (3 )% 18 % 21 % 2.3 pts Pacific 2,806 38 % 14 % 9 % 21 % 26 % 7.3 pts Latin America 1,572 13 % 4 % 3 % 8 % 10 % 1.0 pts Total Mainline 21,408 16 % 3 % 2 % 12 % 14 % 1.0 pts Regional carriers 5,850 11 % (1 )% (2 )% 12 % 13 % 1.0 pts Total passenger revenue $ 27,258 14 % 2 % 1 % 12 % 13 % 1.0 pts Mainline Passenger Revenue. Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to increased business demand for air travel and an increase in fares, largely due to the strengthening of the airline industry revenue environment. During 2009, weakened demand for air travel from the global recession and the effects of the H1N1 virus and related capacity reductions had a significant negative impact on our mainline passenger revenue. Domestic Passenger Revenue . Domestic passenger revenue increased 11% from a 9% increase in PRASM on a 0.3 point decrease in load factor and a 2% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 9%, reflecting an increase in business travel and an increase in fares. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue increased 22% from a 21% increase in PRASM and a 2.4 point increase in load factor on a 1% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 17%, reflecting an increase in demand for air travel and an increase in fares. 27 Table of Contents Regional carriers . Passenger revenue of regional carriers increased 11% from a 13% increase in PRASM and a 1.0 point increase in load factor on a 2% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 12%, reflecting an increase in demand for air travel and an increase in fares. Cargo . Cargo revenue increased due to a 13% increase in yield and a 25% increase in volume, primarily in international markets, partially offset by capacity reductions due to the retirement of our dedicated freighter aircraft in 2009. Other . Other revenue increased due to higher baggage fee revenue from an increased volume of checked bags.

( Compass ) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. ( Mesaba ) to Trans States Airlines, Inc. ( Trans States ) and Pinnacle Airlines Corp. ( Pinnacle ), respectively. Upon the closing of these transactions, we entered into new or amended long-term capacity purchase agreements with Compass, Mesaba and Pinnacle. Prior to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba as our wholly-owned subsidiaries were reported in the applicable expense line items. Subsequent to these sales, expenses related to Compass and Mesaba are reported as contract carrier arrangements expense. Aircraft fuel and related taxes . Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased due to higher average unhedged fuel prices, which increased fuel costs $1.6 billion, partially offset by reductions of $1.3 billion in fuel hedge costs and $156 million from the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. We recorded $89 million in net fuel hedge costs for 2010, compared to $1.4 billion in 2009. The fuel hedge costs for 2009 were primarily from losses on hedge contracts purchased in 2008 when fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise but instead declined. Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense increased primarily due to higher average fuel prices and the change in reporting described above due to the transactions involving Compass and Mesaba. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased primarily due to returning aircraft to service after temporary storage, as well as the timing of engine and airframe maintenance volumes. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses increased primarily due to higher revenue-related expenses, such as booking fees and sales commissions, from the increase in revenue. Profit sharing. We recorded $313 million related to our broad-based employee profit sharing plans for 2010. We did not record any profit sharing expense in 2009. Our broad-based profit sharing plans provide that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined in the plan document), we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees. 28 Table of Contents Restructuring and merger-related items. Restructuring and merger-related items increased primarily due to the following: During 2010, we recorded a $268 million charge primarily for merger-related items and $182 million in asset impairment charges related to the initiative to substantially reduce our 50-seat aircraft and the retired dedicated freighter aircraft. During 2009, we recorded a $288 million charge primarily for merger-related items and a $119 million charge in connection with employee workforce reduction programs. Other (Expense) Income Other expense, net for 2010 was $1.6 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for 2009. This change is attributable to the following: (Unfavorable) Favorable vs. Year Ended (in millions) December 31, 2009 Loss on extinguishment of debt $ (308 ) Net interest expense (88 ) Mark-to-market adjustments on the ineffective portion of fuel hedge contracts (61 ) Foreign currency exchange rates (52 ) Amortization of debt discount, net 154 Other 3 Total other expense, net $ (352 ) For additional information regarding our loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of debt discount, net, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations. For 2010, we recorded an income tax provision of $15 million, primarily related to international and state income taxes. We did not record an income tax provision for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance. For 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $344 million, including a non-cash income tax benefit of $321 million on the loss from continuing operations, with an offsetting non-cash income tax expense of $321 million on other comprehensive income. We did not record an income tax benefit for U.S. federal income tax purposes in 2009 since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2010, we had $17.1 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes during the next several years. Our U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2022. Results of Operations 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined In this section, we compare Delta results of operations under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2009 with Delta results of operations on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2008. For this purpose, Delta results of operations for 2008 on a combined basis add (1) Delta results of operations under GAAP for 2008, which includes Northwest results of operations from October 30 to December 31, 2008 and (2) Northwest results of operations from January 1 to October 29, 2008. This presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing Delta financial performance in 2009 and 2008. 29 Table of Contents Delta results of operations for 2008 on a combined basis are derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements but are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain of this information is considered non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.

Mainline passenger revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to weakened demand for air travel from the global recession, capacity reductions and the effects of the H1N1 virus on passenger travel. Passenger mile yield and PRASM both declined 15%. Domestic Passenger Revenue . Domestic passenger revenue decreased 20% from a 14% decrease in PRASM on an 8% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield decreased 14%, reflecting (1) a reduction in business demand due to the global recession, (2) an overall decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures and (3) lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue decreased 23% from a 17% decrease in PRASM on a 7% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield decreased 17%, reflecting (1) significantly reduced demand for international travel, (2) competitive pricing pressures (especially in the Atlantic market, which experienced a 20% decrease in passenger mile yield), primarily from a significant decrease in business demand due to the global recession and (3) the impact of the H1N1 virus, most notably in the Pacific and Latin America markets. The decrease in passenger mile yield in the Atlantic market also reflects unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. Regional carriers . Passenger revenue of regional carriers declined $804 million primarily as a result of a 13% decrease in passenger mile yield while traffic and capacity remained flat. The decrease in passenger mile yield reflects a reduction in demand for air travel due to the global recession and an overall decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures. 30 Table of Contents Cargo . Cargo revenue decreased due to capacity reductions, significantly reduced cargo yields and international volume as a result of the global recession, and lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year decline in fuel prices. During 2009, we retired our remaining 10 dedicated freighter aircraft, which contributed to a 40% decline in capacity. Other . Other revenue increased $241 million primarily due to new or increased baggage handling fees and higher SkyMiles program revenue, partially offset by decreased revenue from our alliance agreements and a reduction in our aircraft maintenance and repair service.

Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased $5.0 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to $4.8 billion associated with lower average fuel prices and $858 million from a 7% decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions. These decreases were partially offset by $1.4 billion in fuel hedge losses for 2009, compared to $666 million in fuel hedge losses for 2008. The fuel hedge losses in 2009 are primarily from hedges purchased in 2008 during the period fuel prices reached record highs and were expected to continue to rise but instead declined. Salaries and related costs . Salaries and related costs increased $289 million due to (1) pay increases for pilot and non-pilot frontline employees, (2) higher pension expense from a decline in the value of our defined benefit plan assets as a result of market conditions and (3) Delta airline tickets awarded to employees as part of an employee recognition program. These increases were partially offset by a 5% average decrease in headcount primarily related to workforce reduction programs. Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense decreased $844 million primarily due to decreases of $714 million associated with lower average fuel prices and $119 million from a 7% decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $784 million as a result of $641 million in impairment related charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily related to certain definite-lived intangible assets and aircraft, and $125 million related to the December 2008 multi-year extension of our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express (the American Express Agreement ), extending the useful life of the American Express Agreement intangible asset to the date the contract expires. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased $347 million primarily from capacity reductions. 31 Table of Contents Passenger commissions and other selling expenses. Passenger commissions and other selling expenses decreased $362 million primarily in connection with the passenger revenue decrease. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. During 2008, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. We determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $10.2 billion on a combined basis. We also recorded a non-cash charge of $955 million on a combined basis to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values. Restructuring and merger-related items. Restructuring and merger-related items decreased $949 million, primarily due to the following: During 2009, we recorded a $288 million charge for merger-related items. For 2009, we recorded a $119 million charge in connection with employee workforce reduction programs. During 2008, we recorded $1.2 billion primarily in non-cash, merger-related charges related to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards in connection with the Merger and $114 million in restructuring and related charges in connection with voluntary workforce reduction programs. In addition, we recorded charges of $25 million related to the closure of certain facilities and $14 million associated with the early termination of certain contract carrier arrangements.

This change is primarily attributable to (1) a $200 million increase in interest expense from increased amortization of debt discount, (2) a $151 million decrease in interest income primarily from significantly reduced short-term interest rates, (3) an $83 million non-cash loss for the write-off of the unamortized discount on the extinguishment of certain Northwest debt and (4) a $421 million favorable change in miscellaneous, net due to the following: Favorable (Unfavorable) 2009 GAAP vs. (in millions) 2008 Combined Miscellaneous, net Impairment in 2008 of minority ownership interest $ 213 Foreign currency exchange rates 99 Mark-to-market adjustments on the ineffective portion of fuel hedge contracts 77 Loss on investments in 2008 41 Other (9 ) Total miscellaneous, net $ 421 32 Table of Contents Income Taxes 2008 GAAP Year Ended GAAP Northwest Combined December 31, Year Ended January 1 to Year Ended (in millions) 2009 December 31 October 29 December 31 Increase Income tax benefit $ 344 $ 119 $ 211 $ 330 $ 14 We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations. For 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $344 million, including a non-cash income tax benefit of $321 million on the loss from continuing operations, with an offsetting non-cash income tax expense of $321 million on other comprehensive income. We did not record an income tax benefit for U.S. federal income tax purposes in 2009 since our deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance. We recorded an income tax benefit of $330 million for 2008 on a combined basis due to the impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit because goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. We did not record an income tax benefit for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the remaining loss for 2008. The deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance. Financial Condition and Liquidity We expect to meet our cash needs for the next 12 months from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $5.2 billion in unrestricted liquidity, consisting of $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2010, total debt and capital leases, including current maturities, was $15.3 billion, a $1.9 billion reduction from December 31, 2009. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens. Fleet Strategy. We continue to focus on investing in our existing fleet, including investments in our domestic mainline aircraft to: (1) add winglets to increase fuel efficiency and (2) expand the First Class cabin on much of our domestic mainline fleet in response to business customer demand. We are also investing in our international transoceanic aircraft to enhance our product by featuring full flat bed seats in BusinessElite and in-seat audio and video in all cabins. In addition, we are making investments in our regional aircraft product to create a consistent experience by adding First Class to 70 and 76 seat regional jets. Throughout 2010, we have been acquiring previously owned MD-90 aircraft at significantly lower ownership and total cost relative to comparable new aircraft, and we will seek to acquire additional previously owned MD-90 aircraft in the future. We are also evaluating the future replacement needs for our domestic mainline fleet. If determined necessary, we will seek to acquire previously owned aircraft or place an aircraft order to replace older, less efficient aircraft, such as the DC-9 aircraft. If an aircraft order is placed, we would not expect deliveries of new aircraft to begin earlier than 2013. We have no immediate fleet renewal needs for international aircraft. As previously announced, we continue to substantially reduce our 50-seat regional jet aircraft fleet, retire our DC-9 fleet and eliminate our regional turboprop fleet. JFK Redevelopment. John F. Kennedy International Airport ( JFK ) is one of the world busiest airports in one of the most competitive airline markets. We currently operate primarily at Terminal 2 for domestic flights and Terminal 3, which was constructed in 1960, for international flights under leases with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ( Port Authority ). We also conduct some flights from Terminal 4, which is operated by JFK International Air Terminal, LLC, a private party, under its lease with the Port Authority. 33 Table of Contents During the December 2010 quarter, we began a redevelopment project that we believe will create a state-of-the-art facility for us at JFK. We estimate this project will cost approximately $1.2 billion and will be completed in stages over five years. This project includes the (1) enhancement and expansion of Terminal 4, including the construction of nine new gates; (2) construction of a passenger connector between Terminal 2 and Terminal 4; (3) demolition of the outdated Terminal 3 facilities; and (4) development of the Terminal 3 site for aircraft parking positions. Upon completion of the Terminal 4 expansion, expected to occur in 2013, we will relocate our operations from Terminal 3 to Terminal 4; proceed with demolition activities in Terminal 3; and thereafter conduct coordinated flight operations from Terminals 2 and 4. Once our project is complete, we expect that passengers will benefit from an enhanced customer experience and improved operational performance, including reduced taxi times and better on-time performance. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity Events Significant liquidity events during 2010 included the following (see also Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information): American Express Agreement . We and American Express modified our agreement under which we received $1.0 billion in 2008 from American Express for their advance purchase of SkyMiles. Our obligations with respect to the advance payment will be satisfied by the use of SkyMiles by American Express over a specified period ( SkyMiles Usage Period ) rather than by cash payments from us to American Express. The 2010 modification changed the SkyMiles Usage Period to a three-year period beginning in December 2011 from a two-year period beginning in December 2010. Pension Obligations. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot pre-Merger Delta employees and retirees, and defined benefit pension plans for eligible pre-Merger Northwest employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for these plans are generally governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We contributed $728 million to our defined benefit pension plans during 2010. Exit Revolving Facility. We (1) repaid $914 million of our $1.0 billion first-lien revolving credit facility (the Exit Revolving Facility ) and (2) amended the Exit Revolving Facility to convert the remaining $86 million of revolving commitment to a fully funded, non-revolving loan due April 2012. Borrowings under the Exit Revolving Facility can be repaid without penalty and amounts repaid can be reborrowed. 2009-1 EETC. We received $347 million of net proceeds, which were previously held in escrow, from the 2009 offering of Pass Through Certificates, Series 2009-1 (the 2009-1 EETC ). We used the proceeds received in 2010 to refinance 22 aircraft that secured our 2000-1 EETC, which matured in November 2010. The 2009-1 EETC has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 8.1% and has a final maturity in December 2019. 2010-1A EETC. We completed a $450 million offering of Pass Through Certificates, Series 2010-1A (the 2010-1A EETC ), through a pass through trust. We used the net proceeds to finance two B-777-200LR aircraft purchased in March 2010 and refinance 22 aircraft that secured our 2000-1 EETC. The 2010-1A EETC bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.2% per year and has a final maturity in July 2018. 2010-2A EETC. We completed a $474 million offering of Pass Through Certificates, Series 2010-2A (the 2010-2A EETC ), through a pass through trust. We used $270 million in net proceeds to finance or refinance 12 aircraft. The remaining $204 million is being held in escrow until we refinance other aircraft, including 10 aircraft currently securing our 2001-1 EETC, which matures in September 2011. The 2010-2A EETC bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.95% per year and has a final maturity in May 2019. Other . We used $1.0 billion to: Repurchase in cash tender offers $300 million principal amount of debt; Prepay $435 million of existing debt; Redeem $75 million of other secured financings; and Purchase 18 aircraft off lease. We also restructured $820 million of existing debt, including changes in applicable interest rates and other payment terms. 34 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash Cash Flows From Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.8 billion for 2010, primarily reflecting (1) $2.6 billion in net income after adjusting for items such as depreciation and amortization, (2) a $516 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to our broad-based employee profit sharing plans and increased operations due to the improving economy and (3) a $232 million increase in advance ticket sales primarily due to an increase in air fares. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was partially offset by a $345 million decrease in frequent flyer liability. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting the return from counterparties of $1.1 billion of hedge margin primarily used to settle hedge losses recognized during the period and $690 million in net income after adjusting for items such as depreciation and amortization. Cash used in operating activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1) an increase in aircraft fuel payments due to record high fuel prices for most of the year, (2) the posting of $680 million in margin with counterparties primarily from our estimated fair value loss position on our fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2008, (3) the payment of $438 million in premiums for fuel hedge derivatives entered into during 2008, (4) a $374 million decrease in advance ticket sales due to the slowing economy and (5) the payment of $158 million in 2008 under our broad-based employee profit sharing plan related to 2007.

Flight equipment acquisitions include the purchase of 34 aircraft, four of which were purchased new from the manufacturer, 18 of which were purchased off lease and 12 of which were previously owned. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting net investments of $951 million for flight equipment and $251 million for ground property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $142 million distribution of our investment in a money market fund that was liquidated in an orderly manner in 2010 and $100 million of proceeds from the sale of flight equipment. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting the inclusion of $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents from Northwest in the Merger and $609 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents, primarily related to $500 million of cash from a Northwest borrowing that was released from escrow. These inflows were partially offset by investments of $1.3 billion for flight equipment and $241 million for ground property and equipment. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities totaled $2.5 billion for 2010, reflecting the repayment of $3.7 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including the repayment of $914 million of our Exit Revolving Facility. Cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $1.1 billion in proceeds from aircraft financing, including the 2009-1 EETC, 2010-1A EETC and 2010-2A EETC. Cash used in financing activities totaled $19 million for 2009, primarily reflecting $3.0 billion in proceeds from long-term debt and aircraft financing, largely associated with the issuance of (1) $2.1 billion under three new financings, which included (a) $750 million of senior secured credit facilities, (b) $750 million of senior secured notes, and (c) $600 million of senior second lien notes, (2) $342 million from the 2009-1 EETC offering and (3) $150 million of tax exempt bonds, mostly offset by the repayment of $2.9 billion in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including the Northwest senior secured exit financing facility and the Revolving Facility. 35 Table of Contents Cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1) $1.0 billion in borrowings under a revolving credit facility, (2) $1.0 billion received under the American Express Agreement for an advance purchase of SkyMiles and (3) $1.0 billion from aircraft financing. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of $1.6 billion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 that we expect will be paid in cash. The table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements, among others. In addition, the table does not include expected significant cash payments which are generally ordinary course of business obligations that do not include contractual commitments. The amounts presented are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors. Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table. During 2010, the following significant events impacted our contractual obligations: Our JFK redevelopment initiative. Estimated amounts payable by us under our new 33 year sublease are included in operating lease payments below. Our agreement with The Boeing Company to reaffirm our previous orders for 18 B-787-8 aircraft and to defer delivery of those aircraft from 2008-2010 to 2020-2022. Our estimated payments to purchase these aircraft are included in aircraft purchase obligations below. Our sale of Compass and Mesaba. Our estimated minimum fixed obligations under our capacity purchase agreements with these airlines are included in contract carrier obligations below.

Represents scheduled principal payments on long-term debt reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010. The table excludes $1.0 billion we received from American Express for its advance purchase of SkyMiles because this obligation will be satisfied by American Express use of SkyMiles over a specified period rather than by cash payments from us. For additional information about our long-term debt and agreement with American Express, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Term Debt, Interest Payments. Represents estimated interest payments under our long-term debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements. Interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using LIBOR at December 31, 2010. For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contract Carrier Obligations. Represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with regional carriers (excluding Comair). The reported amounts are based on (1) the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and (2) assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying. For additional information about our capacity purchase agreements, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating Lease Payments. Includes our noncancelable operating leases. For additional information, see Note 6 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents Employee Benefit Obligations. Represents primarily (1) our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and (2) projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. For additional information about our defined benefit pension plans, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Aircraft Purchase Commitments. Represents primarily our commitments to purchase 18 B-787-8 aircraft and 12 previously owned MD-90 aircraft. The table excludes our orders for five A319-100 aircraft and two A320-200 aircraft because we have the right to cancel these orders. For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Obligations. Represents primarily estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, outsourced human resource services, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require significant judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Frequent Flyer Program Our frequent flyer program (the SkyMiles Program ) offers incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements ( Contract Carriers ) and participating airlines, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines. Mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on Delta and participating airlines, membership in our Sky Club and other program awards. We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sold mileage credits to other airlines, $0.0054 per mile at December 31, 2010, and is re-evaluated at least annually. Under the residual method, the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits and the mileage component of passenger ticket sales that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided. The portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold is recognized in income when the related marketing services are provided and classified as other revenue. For additional information, see Recent Accounting Standards. For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ( Breakage ), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles Program was $4.5 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $32 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at December 31, 2010. Fair Value Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following valuation techniques: market approach, cost approach and income approach. Accordingly, the actual amounts may differ materially from the estimates. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 37 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is October 1. As of October 1, 2010, the date of our most recent goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests, the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the carrying values. The key assumptions included (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 10%, (3) assumed discount rates ranging from 10% to 15% depending on the asset and (4) a tax rate of 39.2%. These assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use. Since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the actual amounts may differ materially from these estimates. Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in impairment. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of the weakened U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or other reasons, (6) changes to the regulatory environment and (7) consolidation of competitors in the airline industry. Goodwill. Goodwill reflects (1) the excess of the reorganization value of Delta over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, from the adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy, adjusted for impairment and (2) the excess of purchase price over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1) market capitalization, (2) controlling interest premiums, (3) recent market transactions, (4) projected discounted future cash flows and (5) other factors. If the reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. Identifiable Intangible Assets. Identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and acquired in the Merger. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and the SkyTeam alliance. Definite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of marketing agreements and contracts and are amortized on a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts. We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) potential lease savings from owning the assets, (3) hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename or (4) projected discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. As of October 1, 2010, the date of our most recent impairment test, we determined our Pacific routes and slots continue to have an indefinite life and are not presently impaired. We considered that the U.S. and Japan signed an open skies agreement in October 2010. We currently believe this agreement will not have a significant long-term impact on our Pacific routes and slots. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 38 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $20.3 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010. This value is based on various factors, including the assets estimated useful lives and salvage values. We record impairment losses on flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) deciding to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) operational downsizing, (4) significant changes in the projected cash flows, (5) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (6) changes to the regulatory environment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we record impairment losses when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived assets when these assets are classified as held for sale. To determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Valuation Allowance and Contingencies We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets and establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results, our industry historically cyclical financial results and potential, current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Although the positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that taxing authorities may challenge these positions, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review and adjust the reserves as circumstances warrant and events occur, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our eligible employees and retirees. These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. As of December 31, 2010, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $9.3 billion. During 2010, we contributed $728 million to these plans and recorded $367 million of expense in salaries and related costs on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In 2011, we estimate we will contribute approximately $600 million to these plans and that our expense will be approximately $300 million. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the assets. 39 Table of Contents Discount Rate. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate of 5.69% and 5.93% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 5.93% to 7.19% between 2008 and 2010, due to remeasurements throughout the year. Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets (currently approximately 9%) is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market returns and volatility data with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. These assumptions are largely based on the asset category rate-of-return assumptions developed annually with our pension plan investment advisors; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target. The impact of a 0.50% change in these assumptions is shown in the table below: Effect on Accrued Effect on 2011 Pension Liability at Change in Assumption Pension Expense December 31, 2010 0.50% decrease in weighted average discount rate +$8 million +$1.1 billion 0.50% increase in weighted average discount rate - $12 million - $1.0 billion 0.50% decrease in expected long-term rate of return on assets +$40 million 0.50% increase in expected long-term rate of return on assets - $40 million Funding. Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules ( Alternative Funding Rules ) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a plan (1) may be funded over a fixed 17-year period beginning at the election date and (2) is calculated using a fixed interest rate of 8.85%.The Alternative Funding Rules apply to our defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot pre-Merger Delta employees and retirees, effective April 1, 2007, and to our defined benefit pension plans for eligible pre-Merger Northwest employees and retirees, effective October 1, 2006. While the Pension Protection Act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants. For additional information about our defined benefit pension plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Standards In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The standard revises guidance on the determination of when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting and the allocation of consideration among separately identified deliverables. It also expands disclosure requirements regarding an entity multiple element revenue arrangements. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although it could significantly impact our future financial results as we enter into new or materially modified revenue arrangements related to our SkyMiles Program. 40 Table of Contents Supplemental Information We sometimes use information that is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain of this information is considered non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The following table shows a reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP financial measure. We use this measure because management believes the exclusion of special items is helpful to investors to evaluate our recurring operational performance. Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 Operating income (loss) $ 2,217 $ (324 ) Item excluded: Restructuring and merger-related items 450 407 Operating income excluding special items $ 2,667 $ 83 Glossary of Defined Terms ASM Available Seat Mile. A measure of capacity. ASMs equal the total number of seats available for transporting passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the total number of miles flown during that period. CASM (Operating) Cost per Available Seat Mile. The amount of operating cost incurred per ASM during a reporting period. Passenger Load Factor A measure of utilized available seating capacity calculated by dividing RPMs by ASMs for a reporting period. Passenger Mile Yield or Yield The amount of passenger revenue earned per RPM during a reporting period. PRASM Passenger Revenue per ASM. The amount of passenger revenue earned per ASM during a reporting period. PRASM is also referred to as unit revenue. RPM Revenue Passenger Mile. One revenue-paying passenger transported one mile. RPMs equal the number of revenue passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the number of miles flown by those passengers during that period. RPMs are also referred to as traffic. 41 Table of Contents
